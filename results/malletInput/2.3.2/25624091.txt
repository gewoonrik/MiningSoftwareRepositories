Fitting images into wide carousel preserving aspect ratio  I have a   2.3.2's carousel on homepage. It's dimesions are 870px   320px. The images to be shown on the carousel have generally thinner like 620px   350px; I want to stretch images to full-width (870px) while preserving current width/height ratio.     This can be done using          I want to overlap image's center point with carousel's center. Incoming image will be higher than carousel's height after stretching to 100% witdh. I want it to overflow top and bottom equally.    For example if I stretcg a 620px   350px image to 870px width the new height value will be 490px approx. Substracting it from 320px overflowing height is 170px. So I want it to overflow 85px from top and 85px from bottom.    Image 1 is what I have and Image 2 is what I desire.              What I have tried is to add margin-top with negative value which is not recommended.  Also I have no chance to make calculation in CSS. It should be shift up a bit only.     Example Code
