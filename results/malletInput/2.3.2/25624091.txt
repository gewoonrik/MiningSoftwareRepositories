fitting images into wide carousel preserving aspect ratio  i have a   2.3.2's carousel on homepage. it's dimesions are 870px   320px. the images to be shown on the carousel have generally thinner like 620px   350px; i want to stretch images to full-width (870px) while preserving current width/height ratio.     this can be done using          i want to overlap image's center point with carousel's center. incoming image will be higher than carousel's height after stretching to 100% witdh. i want it to overflow top and bottom equally.    for example if i stretcg a 620px   350px image to 870px width the new height value will be 490px approx. substracting it from 320px overflowing height is 170px. so i want it to overflow 85px from top and 85px from bottom.    image 1 is what i have and image 2 is what i desire.              what i have tried is to add margin-top with negative value which is not recommended.  also i have no chance to make calculation in css. it should be shift up a bit only.     example code
