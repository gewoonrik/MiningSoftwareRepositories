Why are Bootstrap Glyphicons only appearing when debugging in Google Chrome?  I'm using Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 and while I was developing the app in MVC4, I had no issue with the Glyphicons, until I tested it in Firefox and IE.    In firefox, I get the following Image instead of the icons:      I checked the reference to the glyphicons image files and they are all right.    While debugging in Chrome, I can see the icons perfectly (I cleared my cache to see if that was the issue, but the icons persisted).
