CSS isue on alligning of the event block  I wander how, using css (w/o javascript or else), make smth like this:        I will have separate spans and divs for:      MN (Monday - day of the week)    30 (Date)   Sep (Month)   and for the title      Maybe there's any framework to do that? Or could you please provide the example at least of less complicated variant with Date and Month displayed only.    Very much thanksful to any advice.    (If this makes any help, Im using Twitter Bootstrap framework v2.3.2)
