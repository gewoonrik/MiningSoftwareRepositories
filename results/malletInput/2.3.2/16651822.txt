how to make a column stretch to fill container div (while being responsive)  i'm using     (latest version - 2.3.2) for a site i'm building, and want to achieve the following while keeping the site responsive, and also applying best practices for it.    here's a very rough sketch of what i want to have:         the site has a basic header with fixed navbar, a content-fluid div which has three inner divs: a span5, span6, and span1 (for a total of 12 columns). after the content div, a sticky footer with company/copyright info and such.    the problem i'm having is with the span1 column. it is basically decorative (it has 4 vertical color bars, sized at 25% width each), but i'd like to have:      social link icons vertically-centered in the column ( , facebook, linkedin, etc), as shown by the black boxes.   text rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise inside each colored bar. it's only one word each, and is not a priority.   each bar stretching to fill the full height of the parent container (in this case, the content div), since the height of the page is currently set by the highest div, whether it's span5 or span6.      i know there are probably lots of ways to achieve this (pure css, javascript, background-image tiling), but i'm looking for the best practices: avoiding extra markup, using right techniques, in order to learn as much as possible. i've tried setting the parent container (and inner bars) to height: 100%; and playing with min-height as well, but min-height doesn't (seem to) work with percentages.    any help and/or constructive criticism is very welcome.    edit: jsfiddle and full code added:  jsfiddle     also, link to the original site (in case jsfiddle screws something up):  original page
