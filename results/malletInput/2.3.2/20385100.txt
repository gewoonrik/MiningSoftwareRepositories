Can Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins be applied via data attributes at a time of my choosing?   Using Bootstrap 2.3.2     I'm using RequireJS and Backbone to load a bunch of markup dynamically from templates. I believe that because this happens after the Bootstrap module is loaded, the data attributes in the markup are not evaluated by Bootstrap so its JavaScript plugins are not applied.    One option is to use the JavaScript API, but I would really prefer to use the markup data attributes. Is it possible?
