how to distribute width in according to module count?  i am trying to make a joomla template. i am also using   v2.3.2. i want to make a design 3/12-6/12-3/12 distribution.  i am checking if any modules are positioned on the left and right columns      module to left position but it is empty. so the module is not shown. but joomla thinks that there is a module in that position and it has to shrink content with.     how can i use the space if module is not shown on a page?
