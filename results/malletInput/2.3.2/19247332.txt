Libraries for static HTML site?  I am building a completely static HTML site. I have been looking at libraries like  Bootstrap  or  Kirby . But, these libraries seem geared towards using dynamic content or CMS'able content that can be edited after logging in.     Can anyone recommend a good starting point for creating a completely static, non-editable, non-database HTML website?
