libraries for static html site?  i am building a completely static html site. i have been looking at libraries like     or  kirby . but, these libraries seem geared towards using dynamic content or cms'able content that can be edited after logging in.     can anyone recommend a good starting point for creating a completely static, non-editable, non-database html website?
