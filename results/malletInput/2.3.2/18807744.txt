collapse jquery tabs for mobile device  loving these tabs!        but when they display on a smaller device the tab titles all simply move around, which is fine, but i'd really like for them to disappear and be replaced with an icon that can expand into a drop down list, just like the   menu does:       .com/2.3.2/index.html     anyone seen this done?
