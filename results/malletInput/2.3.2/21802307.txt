jquery disable a function  for one of my projects we have a proprietary cms that works by looking for a file in the clients instance directory first and if not found, it defaults to the common directory. so in the common directory, i have shell.js which includes a function for setting the initial state of a collapse div in   2.3.2. i need to be able to disable this function at the client level while still having the function available in the common level. im pretty green at js/jquery, can someone help me?    the code in the shell.js is this...         would .unbind() be the right direction?
