why does the cdn's have 2 // instead of http or https in front of the url  i don't understand that why i look at the following website for a cdn, the url's start with a double "//".  i have seen this on jquery and  .  is it up to the person to put http:// or         cdn.com/       link href="//netdna. cdn.com/ - /2.3.2/css/ -combined.min.css" rel="stylesheet"
