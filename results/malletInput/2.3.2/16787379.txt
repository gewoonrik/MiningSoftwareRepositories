fineuploader doesn't display file chooser dialog  I'm having an issue using FineUploader in my rails application. If I use the drag   drop method to upload files it works perfectly, but if I click the input it doesn't show the explorer window.    In my page, I have some fineUploader items defining:         I'm using twitter   and I've read that there's a problem with compatibility between   and fineuploader.    Versions:    fineuploader-3.5.0  -2.3.2 jquery-1.9.1    Anybody can give me some directions please or solutions about this problem?
