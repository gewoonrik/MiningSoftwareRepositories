Place social buttons in a row  I have various social buttons for Twitter, Facebook and GitHub, etc.  I would like them to all be in a row.  Here is the CSS for my social buttons:         In the CSS that I have I had set them all to be displayed in an inline-block. Can I have help figuring out how to place them all in one row so they cannot move around from that row?  Also, can someone add my screenshot to the post:     ?  If it is relevant I'm using Bootstrap 2.3.2, at the moment of writing.
