  2.3.2 mobile 100% width background  i have a problem with mobile resolutions, because background is not 100% width when i use smaller reolutions. it looks like this:         when i use higher resolutions, it works fine. i have tested my website by using     and it shows that 100% width background works only from 768 x 1024 (ipad - portrait).    how can i fix it?
