FullCalendar + Bootstrap Modal + jQuery UI DateTimepicker + jEditable  so I've got quiet a mashup/collection going on here...In our app we are using  FullCalendar  and events load up in  Bootstrap Modal , then if user wants to, he/she can click on the field and it'll become editable with help of  jEditable , and a new custom "type" that I've created for  Timepicker  field.    Code below is what creates a new input type for the timepicker editable field         The problem that I'm having is that if user clicks on the field to edit, but doesn't pick anything, and clicks off the screen and modal window disappears, and then user click on that event again to edit it, it won't make that field editable again.    One possible cause that I could think of is that when user clicks on the event, it shows up and then user click on the time field to edit it, dropdown shows up but the field is empty, even though the value is in "hidden" field, maybe that's what causing it to render un-editable, but i'm not sure how to bypass that.    Thank you in advance for help and looking into this.
