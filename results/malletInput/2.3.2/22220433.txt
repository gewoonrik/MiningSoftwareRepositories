how to design a two column form using   2.3.2 where the 2nd column takes up the rest space  i would like to design a two column horizontal form using   v2.3.2. the following is the html:         i find that the width of the input-text and textarea on the second column are smaller.  i would like to extend them to take up the rest space.  i tried to use the "input-block-level" class but the input-text and textarea will then not be on the same row as the label.    can anyone help?    thanks in advance!
