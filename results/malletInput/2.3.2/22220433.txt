how to design a two column form using   2.3.2 where the 2nd column takes up the rest space  I would like to design a two column horizontal form using Bootstrap V2.3.2. The following is the html:         I find that the width of the input-text and textarea on the second column are smaller.  I would like to extend them to take up the rest space.  I tried to use the "input-block-level" class but the input-text and textarea will then not be on the same row as the label.    Can anyone help?    Thanks in advance!
