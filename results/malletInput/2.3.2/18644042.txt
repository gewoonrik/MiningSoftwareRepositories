  datepicker - dropdown not... dropping  i'm a complete newbie and have been struggling to successfully implement the    datepicker .     all i get is the input field with the "12-02-2013" value; there is no dropdown once i click on the field. i have looked at other examples here on stackoverflow and elsewhere but i haven't found an answer yet.
