Bootstrap Modal, iFrame and Smart Wizard form  I am trying to launch a smartwizard form from a   modal via iframe and I am having issues with the first page of the form. The modal opens correctly, but STEP 1 of the form has not been opened.  If you click next STEP 2 appears, and you can go back to STEP 1 again, but why wont it do it on launch?    I am creating a site for work and they are currently using ei7 - so this may be iFrame/Explorer 7 specific.    I created a simple page as a test below.
