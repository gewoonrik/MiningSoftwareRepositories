  modal, iframe and smart wizard form  i am trying to launch a smartwizard form from a   modal via iframe and i am having issues with the first page of the form. the modal opens correctly, but step 1 of the form has not been opened.  if you click next step 2 appears, and you can go back to step 1 again, but why wont it do it on launch?    i am creating a site for work and they are currently using ei7 - so this may be iframe/explorer 7 specific.    i created a simple page as a test below.
