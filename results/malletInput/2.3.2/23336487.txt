Why Joomla Bootstrap and official   have different css?  I am using Joomla 3.2.1 and I did a  MVC component  and a menu to it so now in /components/com_MY_COMPONENT_NAME/views/ONE_VIEW_NAME/tmpl/default.php I can write any HTML/PHP I want.    I have been doing tests of some   examples and I realize that the CSS is not exactly the same.    Eg. Button        This may sound quite trivial , but the point is why are different. If I continue using   classes I may find some unexpected behaviours/problems.    There is no joomla template that ensures me that using   like the original?    Thanks in advance.
