why joomla   and official   have different css?  i am using joomla 3.2.1 and i did a  mvc component  and a menu to it so now in /components/com_my_component_name/views/one_view_name/tmpl/default.php i can write any html/php i want.    i have been doing tests of some   examples and i realize that the css is not exactly the same.    eg. button  btn btn-primary  must has (inspecting with fire-bug in   's website ):     background-color: #006dcc; background-image: linear-gradient(#08c, #04c);      but... trying the same (coping the whole table) on my joomla i see that the css is:     background-color: #206991; background-image: none;      here the result:         you can appreciate that the  font-size  is different, but also are  line-height ,  border-radius  and  margin-bottom       this may sound quite trivial , but the point is why are different. if i continue using   classes i may find some unexpected behaviours/problems.    there is no joomla template that ensures me that using   like the original?    thanks in advance.
