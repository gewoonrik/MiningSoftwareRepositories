why joomla   and official   have different css?  i am using joomla 3.2.1 and i did a  mvc component  and a menu to it so now in /components/com_my_component_name/views/one_view_name/tmpl/default.php i can write any html/php i want.    i have been doing tests of some   examples and i realize that the css is not exactly the same.    eg. button        this may sound quite trivial , but the point is why are different. if i continue using   classes i may find some unexpected behaviours/problems.    there is no joomla template that ensures me that using   like the original?    thanks in advance.
