  css override - css attributes disappearing?  i am creating a   2.3.2 website. i need to over-ride some css, such as the header colors, so i created a new css file (actually, i created a new less file, and it created a new css file) called theme.css. this is an asp.net mvc project, so i added that to the bundle.config, and when i run the project, i view the page source, and can see that the theme.css is correctly loading after the  .css, i.e.:         as you can see, the  background-image  and  border-color  properties are now   missing  . i can see  background-color  property is linked to theme.css properly, and nothing is showing up as "struck-through" which is how firebug shows that a property has been over-ridden. it's just "not there".     when i go into the css tab in firebug and examine the theme.css file, again, those two properties are missing. just plain "gone". as if they never existed.     i've checked and rechecked my files. other properties in the theme.css file are there - some are, some aren't...    what the heck? how can an imported *.css file be missing properties?
