Installing   using bower did not provide any css file  I used the usual         bower install  #2.3.2      This worked fine and created a   folder inside bower_components. however this did not provide me with a .css file which i would include in my index.html    the Folder structure looks like this:         All i really wanted was a simple css file to use in my project. I searched around on stackoverflow and internet. Didn't find any directions as to how to use this folder to get my css file. The closet I found was this link:  Bower: Installing legacy   (2.3.2) with bower  which still doesn't say where to get the css file from.     What are the steps I have to take
