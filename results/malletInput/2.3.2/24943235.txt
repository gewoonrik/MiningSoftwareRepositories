create fluid layout like    i'm new to html/css, so i'm probably butchering this.   i'm using  , but first day using it.  i'm trying to exactly mimic the design in the picture under "fluid layout" in this link:     .com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html     i currently have:      div class="container-fluid"       div class="row-fluid"           div class="span2"               !--sidebar content--                          /div            div class="span10"             /div       /div   /div   !-- /container --         my divs' are only about an inch in height though, and i want them to go the bottom of the screen like in the picture. how do i od that?    also, if i want to add a header bar, how do i get it so everything is below that?  apols if this is kind of vague... i'm new to all this. my worry is that i start overwriting all sort of pre-built functionality in css and just end up with a monster...    thanks!
