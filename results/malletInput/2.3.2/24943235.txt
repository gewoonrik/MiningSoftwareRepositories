Create fluid layout like    I'm new to HTML/CSS, so I'm probably butchering this.   I'm using  , but first day using it.  I'm trying to exactly mimic the design in the picture under "Fluid layout" in this link:     .com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html     I currently have:         My divs' are only about an inch in height though, and I want them to go the bottom of the screen like in the picture. How do I od that?    Also, if I want to add a header bar, how do I get it so everything is below that?  Apols if this is kind of vague... I'm new to all this. My worry is that I start overwriting all sort of pre-built functionality in CSS and just end up with a monster...    Thanks!
