Drop-Down Menu not working on mobile devices  The most recent version of twitter   (2.3.2) does seem to have a problem with drop down menus on mobile devices.    When you click on a drop-down menu item after opening the menu, the menu simply closes and no link gets clicked. You can see this on their sample page here:    /examples/hero.html     I found an issue posted at their github page but no solution:    /issues/7927     Does anybody know the trick to fix it?
