showing a   2.3 modal in ember.js  i have a legacy   2.3 app and we need to call a modal. following the   docs (   .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#modals ), i call         the strange thing is that the modal doesn't work the first time but if you reclick it or click another element that shows a modal, it does work. i am not that familiar with either of these but would really like ot get this to work. i would post more  code but i think this is just something that i'm not getting. any ideas would be appreciated?
