showing a   2.3 modal in ember.js  i have a legacy   2.3 app and we need to call a modal. following the   docs (   .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#modals ), i call     newkonf.applicationroute = ember.route.extend({    actions:{     someplace: function(item){      //alert('here i am in someplace: ' + item.last_name);      var modalcontroller = this.controllerfor('modal');      modalcontroller.set('model', item);      var myjt=modalcontroller.get('model');      console.log('my value:' + myjt.first_name);      this.render('modal', {        into: 'application',        outlet: 'modal3',        controller: modalcontroller       });       $('#mymodal').modal('show');     }   }  });      the strange thing is that the modal doesn't work the first time but if you reclick it or click another element that shows a modal, it does work. i am not that familiar with either of these but would really like ot get this to work. i would post more  code but i think this is just something that i'm not getting. any ideas would be appreciated?
