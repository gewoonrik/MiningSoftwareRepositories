showing a   2.3 modal in Ember.js  I have a legacy   2.3 app and we need to call a modal. Following the   docs (   .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#modals ), I call         The strange thing is that the modal doesn't work the first time but if you reclick it or click another element that shows a modal, it does work. I am not that familiar with either of these but would really like ot get this to work. I would post more  code but I think this is just something that I'm not getting. Any ideas would be appreciated?
