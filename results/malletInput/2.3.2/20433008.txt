collapse events not triggering   2.3.2 jquery 1.10  i am trying to do something after the accordion div opens but "shown" nor "show" event doesn't fire after the accordion opens     $(document).on('show shown shown hide hidden', '.accordion-field', function(){     console.log('got it');  });      note: accordion-field are generated dynamically after processing some json coming via ajax.    anyone knows why this is not working.    edit:    after adding a static div (not created via code but written on the html) i realized the event fires.      $(document).on('show shown hide hidden', '#xdiv81', function(){     console.log('got it'); } );      how can i do the same for dynamically generated divs
