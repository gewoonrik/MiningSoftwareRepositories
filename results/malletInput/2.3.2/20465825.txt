vertical align middle with   responsive grid  i have a very simple problem on vertical middle a  span  using    2.3.2 .     requirements:        there are two columns, left column has a fixed height 300px because there is 300x300 image inside.     right column has text and must be centered based on left column.     the whole thing must be responsive. that's why i am using responsive image.     if the second column goes down to bottom, its height must fit the size of text. that means i cannot set fixed height on the second column.     must not use js to solve this.        html :      div class="container-fluid"     div class="row-fluid"       div class="span6"           img class="img-responsive" src=" "/       /div       div class="span6 v-center"           div class="content"               h1 title /h1               p paragraph /p           /div       /div     /div   /div        css :     .v-center {     display:table;     border:2px solid gray;     height:300px; }  .content {     display:table-cell;     vertical-align:middle;     text-align:center; }       my code:         you can see what i did above: i basically set the second column  span  as table and  middle  the  .content  table-cell. i copied that method here  how to use vertical align in    (with working example here    )    my challenge is a bit different due to requirements above. any idea on how to make it work? thanks.
