    modal should create new instance every time it opens  i am using   -modal.js v2.3.2     whenever i close the model basically it toggles the modal, meaning previous data persists.     what i'd like is for:      every time i close or hide the modal, it should destroy its data.   every time i open the modal, it should create a new instance.      i tried something like :     $('#update-addresstype').on('hidden.bs.modal', function () {     $(this).data('modal', null); })      but it does not seems to be working.
