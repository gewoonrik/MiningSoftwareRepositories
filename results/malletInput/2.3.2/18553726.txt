  boostrap modal - grey background but no window  i'm having a bit of an odd problem with     and the non-js examples of modal, what happens is that the modal background appears (greys) but the window does not.    i've found if i remove the "hide" class from the modal windows div, it will load but not correctly.    the fiddle is here:             the code has come from this tutorial on  s website    .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#modals
