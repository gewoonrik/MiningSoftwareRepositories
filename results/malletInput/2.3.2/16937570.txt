unable to unbind .modal.data-api events  i have been trying to work out how to remove the data-api from modal dialogs when using    . i am using the current build (version 2.3.2) and have attempted all of the following:    just removing the modal data api on both  body  (as documented) and  document  (as that is where the events actually appear to be bound), still the event occurs.     $("body").off(".modal.data-api");  $(document).off(".modal.data-api");      then i thought i would try removing the whole data api (on both body and document), but neither worked again.     $("body").off(".data-api");  $(document).off(".data-api");      additionally i have tried specifying the selector  [data-toggle="modal"]  on each of the above, but to no avail.    any suggestions would be gratefully received.    update    it appears to be because in    -modal/blob/master/js/ -modal.js  the events are bound wrapped in a function that is passed into jquery:     $(function () {     $(document).off('click.modal').on('click.modal.data-api', '[data-toggle="modal"]', function ( e ) {         var $this = $(this),             href = $this.attr('href'),             $target = $($this.attr('data-target') || (href    href.replace(/.*(?=#[^\s]+$)/, ''))), //strip for ie7             option = $target.data('modal') ? 'toggle' : $.extend({ remote: !/#/.test(href)    href }, $target.data(), $this.data());          e.preventdefault();         $target             .modal(option)             .one('hide', function () {                 $this.focus();             })     }); });      if i remove the  $(function () {  and corresponding  });  then it is possible to unbind the events. so, the question now is, why is it not possible to unbind these events whilst that wrapper is there?    resolution    i hadn't recognised the  $(function() { ... });  as a shorthand for  $(document).ready , especially when it isn't even necessary for  .off  and  .on . so, until the plugin removes that bit of code, i have found that the following will do the job:     $(function() {     $(document).off(".modal.data-api"); });
