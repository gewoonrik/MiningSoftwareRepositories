Horizontal menu in Bootstrap fixed top nav bar splitting into two lines when it overflows.  I have asp.net menu(Dynamic Horizontal) placed inside   fixed top nav bar. It is working fine until top level menu items fit into width of the page. when they exceed the menu split into two rows and is messing up.     How can I make the menu displayed in single line so that the overflowed items can be scroll-able by clicking at the end or in any other means.    Here is my code.         I have used Bootstrap version 2.3.2.  Can anybody help me on this. Thanks in advance.
