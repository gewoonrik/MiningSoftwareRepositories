Reduce size and change text color of the  -datepicker field  Programing an Android application based on HTML5/JQuery launching in a web view, I'm using the Eternicode's  -datepicker. BTW I'm using Jquery 1.9.1 and Bootstrap 2.3.2 with  -responsive.    The picker is working fine but unfortunately I get yet two issues which I was not able to solve at this time:      the picker theme is not respected and some dates are not readable (see the attached picture). Some there is css conflict such as the datepicker's font is displayed white on white background.   I'm not able to reduce the size of the date picker field such as it holds on alone row.           My markup code is:         Do you get any idea about these issues? Thanks very much
