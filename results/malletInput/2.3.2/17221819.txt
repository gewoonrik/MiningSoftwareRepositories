Is it possible to override minified JavaScript functions  Is it possible to override functions contained in a minified Javascript file?    Details: I'm attempting to override the process() function within the Twitter Boootstrap Typeahead plugin (v2.3.2) in order to add an indicator at the bottom of the drop-down if items returned exceed the items displayed.    Here is my code:         If I'm using the minified version of the Bootstrap JavaScript ( .min.js) this fails and actually kills the typeahead functionality completely.  If I instead source the non-minified version ( .js), it works perfectly.      [As a side note, I previously used the same approach with an older version of the typeahead plugin (v1.8.x I believe) and it worked perfectly with the minimized version as well.  Did I just get lucky?]
