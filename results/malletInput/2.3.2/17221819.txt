is it possible to override minified javascript functions  is it possible to override functions contained in a minified javascript file?    details: i'm attempting to override the process() function within the   boootstrap typeahead plugin (v2.3.2) in order to add an indicator at the bottom of the drop-down if items returned exceed the items displayed.    here is my code:         if i'm using the minified version of the   javascript ( .min.js) this fails and actually kills the typeahead functionality completely.  if i instead source the non-minified version ( .js), it works perfectly.      [as a side note, i previously used the same approach with an older version of the typeahead plugin (v1.8.x i believe) and it worked perfectly with the minimized version as well.  did i just get lucky?]
