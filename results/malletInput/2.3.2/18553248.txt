how do i line up three posts in a row dynamically?  i am trying to make a grid portfolio page using   2.3.2 that automatically pulls my posts.     i want the grid to be 3 images wide. for some reason it seems to work but the images and post content does not all align properly once it passed row one.     below is the picture (with red boxes representing my posts featured image) followed by the code.
