Bootstrap carousel navigation dots don't change to active on loop  I've got a Django template that I'm using a dynamic Twitter Bootstrap Carousel on, and after a bit of work I've managed to get the indicators to appear (having had to add them manually for some odd reason) and they change class to active as the slides pass, but once the carousel loops the navigation dots stop picking up the active class. However, if you interact with the carousel by clicking on the next or prev arrows the class on the indicators suddenly start to change to active.    I've had to place a call to the jquery cdn and the Bootstrap cdn to get the carousel working to this level, but I really need to get the indicators to change class correctly without needing the user to click on one of the navigation arrows first.    This is the code I'm using:          Can anyone suggest what I'm doing wrong? I suspect that there's a jQuery clash somewhere, as I'm working on this site as part of a group and there is a lot of jQuery being used throughout the site. As an experiment I wrote a small php page with a carousel in, using the same cdns and that worked straight 'out of the box', in fact I didn't even need to hand code the indicators.
