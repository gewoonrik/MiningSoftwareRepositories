Bootstrap layout issue  I have a HTML layout structure defined as below;         I am also using Bootstrap 2.3.2    Now "globalInfo" div and lowerGrid gets populated on render after API call.    My issue is that I have given globalInfo an initail height of 260px...But there are some form elements (textbox) inside "globalInfo" and on user actions like invalid input, I show an error div dynamically which increase the height of globalInfo and that causes some issue with the lower div .    Actually "Header 2" changes it's position and moves to the right when the additional error div gets displayed under globalInfo ?    How do I fix the issue ? I have to give a static height for globalInfo initially...so cannot remove that to fix this.
