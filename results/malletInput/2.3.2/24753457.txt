  layout issue  i have a html layout structure defined as below;      div class="span9"       div style="margin:10px"  h4 header 1 /h4  /div       div id="globalinfo" style="height:260px"  /div       div style="margin:10px"  h4 header 2 /h4  /div       div class="row-fluid"           div id="lowergrid" style="width:850px; height:200px"  /div       /div   /div       i am also using   2.3.2    now "globalinfo" div and lowergrid gets populated on render after api call.    my issue is that i have given globalinfo an initail height of 260px...but there are some form elements (textbox) inside "globalinfo" and on user actions like invalid input, i show an error div dynamically which increase the height of globalinfo and that causes some issue with the lower div .    actually "header 2" changes it's position and moves to the right when the additional error div gets displayed under globalinfo ?    how do i fix the issue ? i have to give a static height for globalinfo initially...so cannot remove that to fix this.
