  layout issue  i have a html layout structure defined as below;         i am also using   2.3.2    now "globalinfo" div and lowergrid gets populated on render after api call.    my issue is that i have given globalinfo an initail height of 260px...but there are some form elements (textbox) inside "globalinfo" and on user actions like invalid input, i show an error div dynamically which increase the height of globalinfo and that causes some issue with the lower div .    actually "header 2" changes it's position and moves to the right when the additional error div gets displayed under globalinfo ?    how do i fix the issue ? i have to give a static height for globalinfo initially...so cannot remove that to fix this.
