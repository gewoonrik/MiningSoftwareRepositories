How do I get rid of the top border on this table header?  I am using   2.3.2 and have a table with 2 headers (only 1 header will be shown at one time). Here's  my fiddle          The initial view has .view_1 hidden and .view_2 shown. However, there's a slight top border on the header. This border disappears when you hide .view_2 and show .view_1. How do I hide that top border when .view_2 is shown?    Thanks!
