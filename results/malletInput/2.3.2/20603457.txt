how do i get rid of the top border on this table header?  i am using   2.3.2 and have a table with 2 headers (only 1 header will be shown at one time). here's  my fiddle          the initial view has .view_1 hidden and .view_2 shown. however, there's a slight top border on the header. this border disappears when you hide .view_2 and show .view_1. how do i hide that top border when .view_2 is shown?    thanks!
