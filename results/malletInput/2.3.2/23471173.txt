 .js carousel load specific item  i have a   .js  carousel based on  this tutorial  , it has 4 view item , each one looks like that  -       div class="item active"  !-- class of active since it's the first item --             div class="carousel-caption"               p caption text1 here /p             /div   /div        demo here -          it also has right and left buttons which slide the content on the menu according the the items order  .      so my question is  -      which command (probably any jquery selector) would cause to load a specific "item" to the menu  ?    for example ,  something like  -  $('.carousel')[3].showonmenu(...)  to load the 4nd item on the menu .
