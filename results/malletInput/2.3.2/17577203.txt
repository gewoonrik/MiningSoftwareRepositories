how to download     excluding glyphicons to use font-awesome  how do i download   excluding glyphicons?     i want to use font-awesome and i want to call it internally from a directory on my site. currently, i've only found how to call external links, but i do not always have access to the internet, and if my internet connection is  down  i can't test on my localhost.    i currently do it like this:         i have looked at the stack-overflow questions regarding   and font-awesome, but it recommends external links, which would not work for me.
