in  .css, why is *display added after display?  i am working on improving my basic css fundamentals and came across this question that i could not seem to google the answer.    in     2.3.2, there are a couple times within  .css where the stylesheet is as the following:     ul.inline   li, ol.inline   li {   display: inline-block;   *display: inline;   padding-right: 5px;   padding-left: 5px;   *zoom: 1; }      and another example would be:     .row-fluid .span12 {   width: 91.48936170212765%;   *width: 91.43617021276594%;  }        * is a universal selector. if they added *width after "width", *width will override the "width" before, correct? please advise.    ps: i already researched this question and was not able to find the answer. if this is similar, i would really appreciate a link to the other post, thanks.
