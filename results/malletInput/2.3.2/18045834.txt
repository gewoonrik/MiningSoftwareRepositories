In  .css, why is *display added after display?  I am working on improving my basic css fundamentals and came across this question that I could not seem to google the answer.    In twitter   2.3.2, there are a couple times within  .css where the stylesheet is as the following:         * is a universal selector. If they added *width after "width", *width will override the "width" before, correct? Please advise.    PS: I already researched this question and was not able to find the answer. If this is similar, I would really appreciate a link to the other post, thanks.
