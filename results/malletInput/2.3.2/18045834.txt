in  .css, why is *display added after display?  i am working on improving my basic css fundamentals and came across this question that i could not seem to google the answer.    in     2.3.2, there are a couple times within  .css where the stylesheet is as the following:         * is a universal selector. if they added *width after "width", *width will override the "width" before, correct? please advise.    ps: i already researched this question and was not able to find the answer. if this is similar, i would really appreciate a link to the other post, thanks.
