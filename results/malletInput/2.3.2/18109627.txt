Auto-close Bootstrap accordion panel when switch to mobile screen size  Using Bootstrap 2.3.2 I have an accordion with a single panel that is open when the page is loaded.         The site is fully responsive. When switching to a mobile screen size [ @media (max-width: 979px) ] I want the accordion panel to close automatically, i.e. effectively I want the div refine-search line to change to "collapse out".    When in mobile mode, the accordion must still work, e.g. the user can click on the accordion heading and the panel will expand hence I do not want duplicate divs to turn the panel off using .hidden-desktop utility classes etc.    I've searched high and low for an answer - can anyone help?
