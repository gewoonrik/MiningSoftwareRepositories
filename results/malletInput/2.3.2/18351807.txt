  navbar responsive dropdown doesn't respond to touch  i'm using     2.3.2 to build a responsive site.  i have a navbar with dropdown menus:           on a desktop browser, the drop down responds to a click, even if the window is resized to show the mobile view.  when i use my nexus 4 using both chrome   dolphin browser, the drop down links don't work.  the caret button works, when i click a dropdown link, the dropdown menu retracts and i am not redirected.  i haven't tried other mobile devices however.      is this a known issue?
