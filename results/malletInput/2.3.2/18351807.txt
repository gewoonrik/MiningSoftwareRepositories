Bootstrap navbar responsive dropdown doesn't respond to touch  I'm using Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 to build a responsive site.  I have a navbar with dropdown menus:           On a desktop browser, the drop down responds to a click, even if the window is resized to show the mobile view.  When I use my Nexus 4 using both Chrome   Dolphin Browser, the drop down links don't work.  The caret button works, when I click a dropdown link, the dropdown menu retracts and I am not redirected.  I haven't tried other mobile devices however.      Is this a known issue?
