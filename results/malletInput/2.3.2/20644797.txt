google maps inside   tab-content are  i'm trying to put a google map inside a   content-tab ( this ). this is my code for the map:      style  #map_canvas {     width: 500px;     height: 400px; }  /style   script src=" "  /script   script  function initialize() {     var map_canvas = document.getelementbyid('map_canvas');     var mapoptions = {       center: new google.maps.latlng(44.5403, -78.5463),       zoom: 8,       maptypeid: google.maps.maptypeid.roadmap     }     var map = new google.maps.map(map_canvas, mapoptions); };  google.maps.event.adddomlistener(window, 'load', initialize);  /script       this is where i place the map_canvas div:      div class="tab-content"      ...other divs here...       div class='tab-pane fade' id='contact'        div class="row"            div id="send_email" class='span4 pull-right'            ...blablabla a form here...           /div            div id="information" class='span8'            ul ...contact info... /ul            div id="map_canvas"  /div               /div       /div   /div       this is the code for the divs:     $('#navtabs a').click(function (e) {   e.preventdefault();   $(this).tab('show'); });      really, nothing special about it. yet for some reason the map is off to the side, and looks like this:         if i try and move it it just auto-fixes itself to be half-outside like in the picture. ommiting  .css solves the problem. putting  #map_canvas  outside the content-tabs also solves the problem. yet i can't tell exactly what's screwing it up.     it isn't related to the max-width issue  as suggested here , since i'm using   is 2.3.2 which addresses it and includes these lines by default (adding them to my own css doesn't help either):     #map_canvas img, .google-maps img {   max-width: none !important; }      i tried playing with chrome developer tools and scanning the divs and its parents, i went over the  .tab-content  inside   css, i tried ommiting the entirety of the img attributes inside the  .css, i tried  many   other   solutions  from so, to no avail.    any help would be much appreciated.
