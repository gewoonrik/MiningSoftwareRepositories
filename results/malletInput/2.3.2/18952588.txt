  password field padding issue  it seems that     has some issues with padding the password field in chrome. this  image  is from   's documentation .    i've unchecked everything in the chrome developer tools, but no luck finding the issue. password fields work on other websites. i've tested in incognito mode, without any extensions. is it just me?
