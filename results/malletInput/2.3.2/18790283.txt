Bootstrap jquery modal window and tab  I have a modal window that loads its content dynamically through "data-remote" html attribute.     This works perfect inside that modal window there are two tabs, one with id "principal" and the other one with and dynamic id. Again all this is working, the content is loading perfectly, the tab "principal" has the class "active" so when modal windows is open that tab is open by default. Then inside that "principal" tab I have a link that open the second tab.    So I have page where this modal is open with a link:         This code open the modal but with "principal" tab, what I have to do, so it open the second tab.    Thanks    Ps. I am using   2.3.2 with jquery 1.9
