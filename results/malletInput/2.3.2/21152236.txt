  / ie9 grid layout bug  i really could use help on this. most of the time my app looks fine.  see the first attachment.  however most of the time on ie 9 it looks terrible.  see second attachment.     i'm using the basic grid layout in   2.3.2.    to make things especially annoying, on ie 9 the problem goes away when the lightbox is refreshed.    things i've tried:      i confirmed i'm not in 'quirks mode'    its unrelated to 'protected mode'    it works fine in ie 10   11   i tried changing the widths of the images, no effect   i tried fluid grid, but its the same behavior      any suggestions would be much appreciated.
