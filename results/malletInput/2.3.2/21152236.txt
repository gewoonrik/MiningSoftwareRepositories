Bootstrap / IE9 Grid layout bug  I really could use help on this. Most of the time my app looks fine.  See the first attachment.  However most of the time on IE 9 it looks terrible.  See second attachment.     I'm using the basic Grid layout in Bootstrap 2.3.2.    To make things especially annoying, on IE 9 the problem goes away when the lightbox is refreshed.    Things i've tried:      I confirmed i'm not in 'Quirks Mode'    Its unrelated to 'Protected Mode'    It works fine in IE 10   11   I tried changing the widths of the images, no effect   I tried Fluid Grid, but its the same behavior      Any suggestions would be much appreciated.
