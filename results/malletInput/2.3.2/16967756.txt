  responsive site ingores viewport setting  why does our responsive site, in a 320px wide window, scale differently on a phone, than it does on a desktop browser    the  problem  turned out to be this update in  's v2.3.2 responsive-utilities.less file.     @-ms-viewport{   /* comment this out!!! */   width: device-width; }      when we commented this out, the mobile 320px browser renders the same as a desktop 320px browser does.     we did not have to make any other changes. that is, it was okay to have 1500px images in our site, and we didn't have to change our existing viewport meta tag, which is as follows:      meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"       a follow up question: what is that @-ms-viewport line for anyway?
