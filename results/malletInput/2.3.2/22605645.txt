Multiple affix navbar menu with Bootstrap 2 per page    How can put two or more navigation bar using  Bootstrap 2  ?      I try to put two connected navbars, one horizontal menu (main, with offset top) and one menu which is dynamic based on scroll height (only with bullet points, so when you scroll it will be always in the middle right). For example when I'm on "HOME"  main menu  is active and first bullet point is active too, or "CONTACTS" (last on the list) is active and the last bullet on  dynamic menu  is active too, so they may be are similar, but I need them to be two. I use     .min.js and .min.css    When I use "data-elements" or javascript (I use this), the menus don't work properly, they blink(flicker). When I use only one of them work right.      How can I make them to work together ?      My  JavaScript
