how to give user more time on   dropdown menu?  i am using the   dropdown menu (2.3.2 on the site in question but v3 has same issue) on several sites.  i find the menu works well unless i have a lot of longer submenus.  the problem is that the mouseover range seems too precise and there is no "timeout" on mouseout.  is there a way to keep previous submenu up until x amount of time unless they click on another menu area?         i tried adding transition-delay  to the submenu css and nothing had any affect.
