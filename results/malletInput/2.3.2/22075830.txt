How to give user more time on   dropdown menu?  I am using the   dropdown menu (2.3.2 on the site in question but v3 has same issue) on several sites.  I find the menu works well unless I have a lot of longer submenus.  The problem is that the mouseover range seems too precise and there is no "timeout" on mouseout.  Is there a way to keep previous submenu up until X amount of time unless they click on another menu area?         I tried adding transition-delay  to the submenu css and nothing had any affect.
