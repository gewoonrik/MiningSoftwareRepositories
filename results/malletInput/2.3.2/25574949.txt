whats a good combination of versions for  , rails, and gems to get the   layout  i've been trying to make   work with rails and have tried most combinations of the following:     ruby =  ruby 1.9.3p545 (2014-02-24) [i386-mingw32]  rails =  rails 4.0.8  gem =  2.4.1   -sass (3.2.0.1, 3.0.2.1, 2.3.2.0, 2.3.1.0) compass (1.0.1) compass-core (1.0.1) high_voltage (2.2.1) less (2.5.1) less-rails (2.5.0) libv8 (3.16.14.3) railties (4.0.8) sprockets (2.12.1, 2.11.0, 2.2.2) sprockets-rails (2.1.3, 2.0.1)  - -rails (2.2.8)      what is the version combinations that seems to work for anyone?
