responsive    i recently added  responsive    to an application and things are working great. i've been able to make modifications to the layout based on screen resolutions like the following in my      now, i'm wondering if it's possible to make modifications like these to my javascript based on screen resolution? specifically, i want a popover on an element to float right by default, but float up when using a phone. what are my options to do something like this? i may be incorrect assuming responsive   can solve the problem, but i feel like it is a solvable problem somehow.
