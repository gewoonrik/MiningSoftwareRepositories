struggling with badge pull-right in horizontal tab (ie9 only)  i have a fiddle that words in ie8, chrome and firefox but fails in ie9.    i'm using   2.3.2 and i want the badges to be on the same line as the text but on the right.  this works in every browser but ie9.  in ie9 the badge shows up below the text.    see:
