share less variables/mixins without duplicating between multiple files in rails  rails asset pipeline compiles all my less files (including   variables, mixins, etc.) to one single stylesheet. the problem is the output css is getting bigger and bigger and lots of styles are only specific to only one page. i want to load those styles only for that page.    so i make the layout to load application.less and also a page specific stylesheet. i @import all the boostrap less files in application.less. but i also want to use some variables/mixins from   in my page specific stylesheet. so i have to @import again the   files in my page specific stylesheet, which i already have in application.less.   is duplicate now.     what's the best way to go around this problem? i tried to use reference import  .
