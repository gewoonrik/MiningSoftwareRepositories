Getting a HAML button_to work with twitter    I am trying to apply some basic formatting to a Ruby on Rails app using Twitter Bootstrap. I would like to create a button group with three buttons but am having trouble with my haml file.     After looking through all the Twitter Bootstrap  Documentation , I think the problem is that the   style-sheet is expecting   tag, or should I be attacking this problem in a different way?
