getting a haml button_to work with      i am trying to apply some basic formatting to a ruby on rails app using    . i would like to create a button group with three buttons but am having trouble with my haml file.     after looking through all the      documentation , i think the problem is that the   style-sheet is expecting   button   elements (with the proper classes) to place in the button group.    i am currently using the  button_to  helper in my haml file which does not appear to produce the   button   tag. but, i am not experienced enough in haml to know a way around this.    is there a way to make the  button_to  element generate a   button   tag, or should i be attacking this problem in a different way?
