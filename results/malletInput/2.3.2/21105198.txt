in   2.3.2, how can i change the span number of a div when the window size changes?  i am using yiistrap, a yii extension, which currently comes with     2.3.2.     i have two elements in one row which are each span6.       div class="row-fluid"     div class="span6"      lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. nullam vel tristique dolor, ut vehicula mi. donec nec dui a nisl tincidunt suscipit. pellentesque venenatis libero ac augue suscipit, vitae tristique arcu posuere.    /div      div class="span6 visible-desktop"       img src="large_photo.jpg" /     /div   /div       this works great for the desktop size, but once i shrink the window to the phone size, i would like to remove the second element, using the .visible-desktop class.    now i am left with only one element that still has a span6 but i would like for it to be at span12. is there any way i can specify to have it change the remaining element to span12 whenever we're not at the desktop size? i know this is possible in   3, but unfortunately i am stuck with 2.3.2 if i want to use yiistrap.
