In Bootstrap 2.3.2, how can I change the span number of a div when the window size changes?  I am using YiiStrap, a Yii extension, which currently comes with twitter   2.3.2.     I have two elements in one row which are each span6.          This works great for the desktop size, but once I shrink the window to the phone size, I would like to remove the second element, using the .visible-desktop class.    Now I am left with only one element that still has a span6 but I would like for it to be at span12. Is there any way I can specify to have it change the remaining element to span12 whenever we're not at the desktop size? I know this is possible in Bootstrap 3, but unfortunately I am stuck with 2.3.2 if I want to use YiiStrap.
