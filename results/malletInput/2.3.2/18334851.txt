Bootstrap change the color of glyphicons to blue but not at all places  I am using Bootstrap framework for UI. I want to change the color of my glyphicons to blue, but not at all places. At some places it should use the default color.    I have referred to these two links, but I am not finding anything helpful.       Can I add color to   icons only using CSS?     How do I change Bootstrap 3&#39;s glyphicons to white?       Please note: I am using Bootstrap /2.3.2/.
