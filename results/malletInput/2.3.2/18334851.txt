  change the color of glyphicons to blue but not at all places  i am using   framework for ui. i want to change the color of my glyphicons to blue, but not at all places. at some places it should use the default color.    i have referred to these two links, but i am not finding anything helpful.       can i add color to   icons only using css?     how do i change   3&#39;s glyphicons to white?       please note: i am using   /2.3.2/.
