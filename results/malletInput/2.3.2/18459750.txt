 -date_picker conjunction responsive html5 type date for iphone view  i build an iphone friendly view using   2.3.2 and  -date_picker  -date_picker works well unless view is rendered on iphone. i would like to have standart html5 tag  type='date'  without datepicker behaviour for  @media (max-width: 767px)     i'm wondering how to implement such behaviour.    my view:         i can't make second partial with  .visible-phone  because this input is array of nested attributes for my model
