making a multi-column dropdown menu from a button  i am trying to make a multi-column (specifically 2 columns) dropdown menu from a button.   i have tried using the  upgrade   2 html to   3  tool, and it doesn't fix anything but some .btn to .btn.btn-default stuff, which is fine. the code was originally written in   2.3.2, here is what it looks like normally:        and under   3 it looks like this:        here is the code i have:      div class="btn-group"   a class="btn btn-lg btn-success dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="#"    download  span class="caret"  /span   /a   ul class="dropdown-menu"   div class="btn-group btn-group-vertical"   a class="btn btn-success" href="#" windows 32-bit /a   a class="btn btn-default" href="#" windows 64-bit /a   /div   div class="btn-group btn-group-vertical"   a class="btn btn-default" href="#" linux 32-bit /a   a class="btn btn-default" href="#" linux 64-bit /a   /div   /ul   /div       i have also checked out other posts on here before posting but none of them worked as i wanted it to work, or not work at all.
