how to append a button to an .uneditable-input .input-block-level?  there's an  span.input-level.uneditable-input  and i want to append a button to look like the the fisrt example used in this  jsfiddle .    the problem is: it has to be an .input-block-level (to avoid breaking the design).    the code i tried is here:        note: i started the project using      2.3.2 . i'm running out of time and i can't upgrade to 3.0.2.
