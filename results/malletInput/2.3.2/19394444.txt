    rails is loading bootswatch.less before variables.less 3.0  i upgraded my app from   2.3.2 to 3.0.  i got it working with a modified  .css.  when i want to use bootswatch.less and variables.less i get an error where:     variable @navbar-default-bg is undefined      but that variable is defined in the variables.less file. here is my import from my  _and_overrides.css.less file:     @import "bootswatch/variables"; @import "bootswatch/bootswatch";      it is as if it is loading the less files in alphabetical order and not as the import implies.    i tried renaming variables.less to avariables.less and it still isn't getting imported.    note:  the app blows up unless i remove the bootswatch.less file from the app.  it is like all the variables being called in the bootswatch.less file which are defined in variables.less are not being recognized.
