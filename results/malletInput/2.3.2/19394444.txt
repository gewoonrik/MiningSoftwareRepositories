Twitter Bootstrap Rails is loading bootswatch.less before variables.less 3.0  I upgraded my app from Bootstrap 2.3.2 to 3.0.  I got it working with a modified  .css.  When I want to use bootswatch.less and variables.less I get an error where:         It is as if it is loading the less files in alphabetical order and not as the import implies.    I tried renaming variables.less to avariables.less and it still isn't getting imported.    Note:  The app blows up unless I remove the bootswatch.less file from the app.  It is like all the variables being called in the bootswatch.less file which are defined in variables.less are not being recognized.
