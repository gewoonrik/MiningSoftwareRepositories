How to Know Which HTML Element is Causing Vertical Scroll Bar  I am learning  Bootstrap . On the getting started menu, there are few templates given. I am playing with that. One example is about fixed Footer. I used nav from previous example and wanted to adjust that with fixed footer. But vertical scrollbar is coming.  I am looking for element which is causing Vertical Scroll Bar.      Here is HTML:          Is there any trick, which works in these cases to know which Element is causing Scroll Bar?  I faced similar problem earlier, I do not remember if I could find the easy solution.
