assign a glyphicon to a class in bootstap 2.3.2  in    2.3.2 , how can i assign a  glyphicon  to a class, so when i use that class, the glyphicon will appear where it's used.     example:      .heart {   assign icon-heart here }      usage:      span class="heart"  /span        output     the heart icon from the sprite appears here.    is something like this possible?    later i intend changing the  .heart  to  .no-heart  using jquery, and i;ll get another icon there. that's the whole idea.
