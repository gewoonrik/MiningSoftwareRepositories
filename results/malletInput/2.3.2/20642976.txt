rails 4 assets not working in production  for months i have had  -sass working until i did a bundle update. at first the assets would not precompile because the gem had updated to version 3. i changed the gem to  -sass, '2.3.2.0' to force it to use version 2.3 because simple form does not support   3.    now   works in development but not production. it appears not to find the assets although capistrano deploy does a precompile.     gem 'sass-rails', ' = 3.2'  gem ' -sass', '2.3.2.2'  gem 'bootswatch-rails'      in my js console i am seeing this which is a correct fingerprint but there are several files for application.css with different fingerprints:-     get   404 (not found) sports:18 get   404 (not found) sports:20
