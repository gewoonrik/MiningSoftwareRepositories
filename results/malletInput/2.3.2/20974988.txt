select accordion-toggle in nested collapse to fully close accordions  using     2.3.2 collapse plugin.    i'm having trouble trying to manipulate nested accordions with javascript.    i want to capture the id of the last clicked accordion-toggle so that i can refer back to it after i've closed all open accordions.    i can use the on shown/hidden events to globally close all open accordions but i need to then go back and open the last selected item (or do similar in another way if it is simpler).    i can't work out how to create a variable for the selected accordion-toggle. i can only access the accordion at the top level with the 'this' keyword.    can i change the following so that it references the accordion-toggle?
