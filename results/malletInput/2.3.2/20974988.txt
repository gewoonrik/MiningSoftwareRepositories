Select accordion-toggle in nested collapse to fully close accordions  Using Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 Collapse plugin.    I'm having trouble trying to manipulate nested accordions with javascript.    I want to capture the id of the last clicked accordion-toggle so that I can refer back to it after I've closed all open accordions.    I can use the on shown/hidden events to globally close all open accordions but I need to then go back and open the last selected item (or do similar in another way if it is simpler).    I can't work out how to create a variable for the selected accordion-toggle. I can only access the accordion at the top level with the 'this' keyword.    Can I change the following so that it references the accordion-toggle?
