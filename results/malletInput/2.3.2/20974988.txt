select accordion-toggle in nested collapse to fully close accordions  using     2.3.2 collapse plugin.    i'm having trouble trying to manipulate nested accordions with javascript.    i want to capture the id of the last clicked accordion-toggle so that i can refer back to it after i've closed all open accordions.    i can use the on shown/hidden events to globally close all open accordions but i need to then go back and open the last selected item (or do similar in another way if it is simpler).    i can't work out how to create a variable for the selected accordion-toggle. i can only access the accordion at the top level with the 'this' keyword.    can i change the following so that it references the accordion-toggle?     $('.accordion').on('show', function () {     var selected = this.**[accordion-toggle]**     $('.accordion').on('hidden', function () {         clearcollapse();     });   do something with selected item here... });      ----------update--------    after sorting out the event capture with ammu's help, i was able to amend the clearcollapse function to do what i needed. the code actually selects the accordion-body rather than the accordion-toggle.     //function to fully collapse accordion on same page function pagecollapse(inner) {     $('#' + inner).find('.accordion-body').removeclass('in');     $('#' + inner).find('.accordion-body').height('0px'); }      //collapse inner accordion on same page $('.accordion').on('hidden', function (e) {     var selected = e.target.id;     pagecollapse(selected); });
