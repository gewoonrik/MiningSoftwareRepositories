search form pull-left/pull-right on the navigation bar does not work right in chrome  i am migrating from the     version 2.3.2 to the latest version 3 rc 1. now i meet one problem with the search buttons in the top navigation bar. html code is below:         then it will simply work well; but it's not my purpose either.    any issue with my code? or is it a problem with the version 3 rc 1? anyway to address it?
