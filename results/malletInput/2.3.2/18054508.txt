Search form pull-left/pull-right on the navigation bar does not work right in Chrome  I am migrating from the Twitter Bootstrap version 2.3.2 to the latest version 3 RC 1. Now I meet one problem with the search buttons in the top navigation bar. HTML code is below:         Then it will simply work well; but it's not my purpose either.    Any issue with my code? Or is it a problem with the version 3 RC 1? Anyway to address it?
