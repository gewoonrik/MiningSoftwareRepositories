how to collapse a div with jquery without a id  i have a list of questions and answers grouped in different divs. i would like to collapse them when a click event is fired that is placed on the question. i have read the examples from the       page but i would like to tricker the event with javascript and not with data-attributes. with data-attributes every question needs a unique id and this will hard to maintain in the future. i want to trigger the class ".collapse"    code:
