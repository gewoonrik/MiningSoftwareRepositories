Creating a responsive form in the middle of the webpage  I am trying to make an iOS app using HTML and CSS.  For responsive design i am using twitter  . Now what i need is to make a header (at the top of the screen), a form, in the middle of the screen. That form should be scrollable only if user wants to add more details (it would be dynamic, if user enters the required details only, then it should not be scrollable). I am experiencing a problem where I am not able to place the form in the center of the screen. I want it to be vertically as well as horizontally centered.    When i change margin-top, i am able to make it in the middle, but it isnt responsive and gets displaced in ipad resolution. Please help, i am not a designer and new to twitter  .    Here the fiddle:     Here is my code:    HTML
