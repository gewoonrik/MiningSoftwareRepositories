Twitter Bootstrap Javascript - how to use only tooltip library?  I have a project that is without Twitter Bootstrap. I would like to use  Tooltip , so I downloaded   -tooltip.js  file, put it to the page. (there is included jQuery lib as well).    And this is how I am trying to call tooltip:         But the tooltip will never appear, in console log are no JS errors. What am I missing?    Thanks
