.tab-focus()     working on a elements, how possible?  in version 2.3.2 of     you can find this in mixins.less:     // webkit-style focus // ------------------ .tab-focus() {   // default   outline: thin dotted #333;   // webkit   outline: 5px auto -webkit-focus-ring-color;   outline-offset: -2px; }      you can also find that this mixin is being used in forms.less and buttons.less.    however, it's not being using in scaffolding.less where i find this for normal links:     // links // -------------------------      a {       color: @linkcolor;       text-decoration: none;     }     a:hover,     a:focus {       color: @linkcolorhover;       text-decoration: underline;     }      however, i found out, that changing the values of  .tab-focus()  also affects the  :focus  for my normal a elements (links). how is that possible?? how is the css of  .tab-focus()  in tb v. 2.3.2 applies to my links? i can't find it!    ps: i do see that in the latest version of tb they applied it, see below, however the question it how it is possible in v. 2.3.2 where it's not applied that is does affect  :focus .     // links  a {   color: @link-color;   text-decoration: none;     :hover,    :focus {     color: @link-hover-color;     text-decoration: underline;   }     :focus {     .tab-focus();   } }
