Twitter Bootstrap 2.3 Typeahead search element name with character & in Google Chrome  I'm using  's typeahead for autocomplete, it works well, but I have one problem in Google Chrome, if I search for a name that includes a " " then this character is being removed, and I can't search that name, for example H M.    Is there anyway to fix this? In firefox it works, or if I copy and paste the   character it also works.    The example of Bootstrap has also that problem    .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#typeahead     As said that happens in Google Chrome for MacOS
