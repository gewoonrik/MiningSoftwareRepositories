using   and having a weird background issue before container div  i am using   2.3.2 to create my website, it seems like a simple problem and i have spent hours but couldn't fix it. i have added a background colour div before the container div, it does work fine but on resizing browser bg div width start to hide itself from the right side.    i tried using container-fluid but it stretches everything to left and right.    i am not using a responsive layout.    here is my code         looking for help
