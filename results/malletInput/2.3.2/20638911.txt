Passing variable to   modal in MVC3  Code in partial view:         My question is I am trying to pass a string to the modal (Eventually this will be dynamic data containing the variable @ViewBag.somestring). With the string also it does NOT work - the modal appears when clicked on but the textbox does not contain the id which is: "ISBN-001122". I am using jquery-1.7.1 and Bootstrap v2.3.2.
