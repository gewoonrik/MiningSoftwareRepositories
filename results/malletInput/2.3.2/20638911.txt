passing variable to   modal in mvc3  code in partial view:         my question is i am trying to pass a string to the modal (eventually this will be dynamic data containing the variable @viewbag.somestring). with the string also it does not work - the modal appears when clicked on but the textbox does not contain the id which is: "isbn-001122". i am using jquery-1.7.1 and   v2.3.2.
