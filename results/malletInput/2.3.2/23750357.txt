keep   2.3.2 dropdown menu open while opening a modal  i know there are some posts around discussing how to keep a   menu open when clicked, but my scenario is a bit different, and i can't find a working solution yet.    what i need is: to keep the dropdown menu open when an item in that menu is clicked to show a modal. my markup looks like this:      !-- dropdown --   ul       li class="createtag"           a class="createtaga" href="#taginfomodal" role="button" data-toggle="modal" create new /a       /li   /ul    !-- modal --   div id="taginfomodal" class="modal hide" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="mymodallabel" aria-hidden="true"       div class="modal-header header-blue"           button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true" ã— /button           h3 id="mymodallabel" tag info /h3       /div       div class="modal-body"           div class="box-content"               form action="#" method="post" class='form-horizontal form-validate' id="taginfoform" data-bind="submit: savetag"                   div class="control-group"                       label for="nameoftag" class="control-label" tag * /label                       div class="controls"                           input type="text" name="nameoftag" id="nameoftag" class="input-xlarge"                       /div                   /div               /form           /div       /div       div class="modal-footer"           button class="btn btn-primary" data-dismiss="modal" onclick="createnewtag();" save tag /button       /div   /div       the plan here is when the createtag anchor in the dropdown menu is clicked, the modal shows up. what is more, i want the dropdown menu to stay open while the modal is up, and to stay open while the modal is closed too. the default behavior is the dropdown menu goes away when the modal is open, which is not what i want.    i have tried returning false/stop propagation in the anchor's click event handler as suggested in some online answers, while the menu is kept open this way, it breaks the modal -- the modal does not show up anymore.    so my effort to prevent the dropdown menu from being closed is like this:     $(".createtaga").click(function() {     return false; });      i am not familiar with  . can anyone give me some hint?    thanks!
