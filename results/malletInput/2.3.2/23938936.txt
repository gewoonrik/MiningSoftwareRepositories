appyling btn-link attribute to   in   w/ focus  i seem to be having some problems applying the btn-link attribute to a link with  . according to the docs, button styles can be applied to anything with the button class. so if i have something like:      a class="btn btn-link selected" name="test" href="#" test /a       it should apply the btn-link style to that respective link. this seems to work fine except for the "focus" attribute. if you look at the examples on the   page  here , clicking on a button with the btn-link class results in a blue box appearing as a border. with the above html, this does not seem to be the case.    i can get it to show the blue border by forcing the element state to "focus" with chrome dev-tools, but i cannot replicate it any other way. using a selector and then applying a .focus() doesn't seem to work. any thoughts?
