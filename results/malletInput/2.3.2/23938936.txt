Appyling btn-link attribute to   in Bootstrap w/ focus  I seem to be having some problems applying the btn-link attribute to a link with Bootstrap. According to the docs, button styles can be applied to anything with the button class. So if I have something like:         It should apply the btn-link style to that respective link. This seems to work fine except for the "focus" attribute. If you look at the examples on the Bootstrap page  here , clicking on a button with the btn-link class results in a blue box appearing as a border. With the above HTML, this does not seem to be the case.    I can get it to show the blue border by forcing the element state to "focus" with Chrome dev-tools, but I cannot replicate it any other way. Using a selector and then applying a .focus() doesn't seem to work. Any thoughts?
