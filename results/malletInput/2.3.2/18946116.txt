yii booster popover over text rather than button  yii booster  documentation  shows how to make a popover over a button. i want to create one over an anchor element rather than a button. essentially i want to combine the popover with yii's  tooltip . does anyone know how to do this?    this is the code for the pop-over:     $this- widget( ' .widgets.tbbutton', array(     'label' =  'top popover',     'type' =  'primary',     'htmloptions' =  array(         'data-title' =  'a title',         'data-placement' =  'top',         'data-content' =  "and here's some amazing content. it's very engaging. right?",         'data-toggle' =  'popover'     ), ));      if there was a way of altering this to not render a button, but just an anchor the problem would be solved, but i can't find anything in the code that i can use to do this.     update     following sergey's answer, here's what i've put:     echo chtml::link("$detail- text", null,  array( 'rel' =  'popover', 'data-trigger' =  "hover", 'data-title' =  "$header", 'data-content' =  "$body" ));      this is close to what i need, but for some reason the hove doesn't work, only the click and also only the content get's displayed not the title.
