Yii Booster popover over text rather than button  Yii booster  documentation  shows how to make a popover over a button. I want to create one over an anchor element rather than a button. Essentially I want to combine the popover with Yii's  tooltip . Does anyone know how to do this?    This is the code for the pop-over:         This is close to what I need, but for some reason the hove doesn't work, only the click and also only the content get's displayed not the title.
