yii booster popover over text rather than button  yii booster  documentation  shows how to make a popover over a button. i want to create one over an anchor element rather than a button. essentially i want to combine the popover with yii's  tooltip . does anyone know how to do this?    this is the code for the pop-over:         this is close to what i need, but for some reason the hove doesn't work, only the click and also only the content get's displayed not the title.
