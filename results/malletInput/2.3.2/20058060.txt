Twitter Bootstrap v2.3.2 Responsive menu not working in IE or Safari, or mobile  I used this version of Bootstrap just a few months ago to create another site, and I could have SWORN I tested it in IE and Safari, and on my Samsung Galaxy S3 - at any rate, the responsive menu is only working in Chrome and FF.  Started a new site today using this version of Bootstrap (2.3.2) and realized, nope, it isn't working.           When you resize the browser window the menu won't change from the normal, full screen menu to the drop down button.    I KNOW this specific site is not finished.. just wanted to see if I could get this resolved first. :-(    I looked on here at about a half dozen questions similar to mine but so far none of the advice helped  (checked the headers, put the JS scripts above the closing head tag, etc).
