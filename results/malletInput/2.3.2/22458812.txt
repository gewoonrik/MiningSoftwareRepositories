Separate 2 regions of the screen with their own vertical scrollbar  I'm rendering with Angular.js and Bootstrap 2.3.2 a series of thumbnails in the left side of the screen, on the right side I have the larger version, at the moment I'm able to get only one scrollbar, I would like to make them independent with their own vertical scrollbar, without using the frames but only css.    HTML:
