separate 2 regions of the screen with their own vertical scrollbar  i'm rendering with angular.js and   2.3.2 a series of thumbnails in the left side of the screen, on the right side i have the larger version, at the moment i'm able to get only one scrollbar, i would like to make them independent with their own vertical scrollbar, without using the frames but only css.    html:
