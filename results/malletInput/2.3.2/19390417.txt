Bootstrap Select Display Bug  I'm using  Silvio Moreto's BootStrap library  and it's not displaying the select properly.     Here is a  screen shot  of the problem.    My guess is I am doing something wrong. I don't know what's causing this issue, but I checked  my javascript load order and that seems fine.     Below is the html I execute the code on.         Anyone have any idea what's going on? I presume it could be the CSS.    Update::    I only use certain parts of the   framework because there's a lot that I don't need. I use version 2.3.2 of button, form, and dropdown js/css, but, for some reason, it isn't enough for   selector.     Here is a picture using only   3.0 sources from the  test file .    Thanks!
