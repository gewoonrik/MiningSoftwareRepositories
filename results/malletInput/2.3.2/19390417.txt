  select display bug  i'm using  silvio moreto's   library  and it's not displaying the select properly.     here is a  screen shot  of the problem.    my guess is i am doing something wrong. i don't know what's causing this issue, but i checked  my javascript load order and that seems fine.     below is the html i execute the code on.         anyone have any idea what's going on? i presume it could be the css.    update::    i only use certain parts of the   framework because there's a lot that i don't need. i use version 2.3.2 of button, form, and dropdown js/css, but, for some reason, it isn't enough for   selector.     here is a picture using only   3.0 sources from the  test file .    thanks!
