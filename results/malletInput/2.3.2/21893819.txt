unable to properly align and size inputs with add-ons in    i'm creating a   2.3.2 form, and i'd like to have an add-on appended to my input.    problem i'm running into is the add-on screws up the alignment and the sizing of the input.    i'm read through the docs and can't find an appropriate example, and no luck googling the issue yet.    here's the code        i tried a couple things like adding extra div layers, but no luck yet.
