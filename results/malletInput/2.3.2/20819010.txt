  3: does form-horizontal work for radio buttons with a control-label?  this has wasted several hours of my day. here's a very simple form, with 2 radio buttons and a label, on  bootply . this works as expected on 2.3.2: 'date range' on the left, buttons on the right. on   3, everything's out, it's basically vertical instead of horizontal, the text is bold, and it's just a mess. any ideas, short of re-doing this as a grid?    thanks.     edit     this is the expected layout, when b2.3.2 is selected on bootply:         this is what i get when i select any b3+:
