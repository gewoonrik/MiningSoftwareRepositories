Bootstrap 3: does form-horizontal work for radio buttons with a control-label?  This has wasted several hours of my day. Here's a very simple form, with 2 radio buttons and a label, on  bootply . This works as expected on 2.3.2: 'Date Range' on the left, buttons on the right. On Bootstrap 3, everything's out, it's basically vertical instead of horizontal, the text is bold, and it's just a mess. Any ideas, short of re-doing this as a grid?    Thanks.     EDIT     This is the expected layout, when B2.3.2 is selected on bootply:         This is what I get when I select any B3+:
