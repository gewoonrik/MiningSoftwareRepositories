issues using fuelux with foundation  i have a project built on top of zurb foundation, now i need to use some fuelux components such as "wizard" and "tree". for that i include     library (2.3.2 version downloaded from   site) and also include "all.min.js" from fuelux, when i use the same html markup as come in  index.html  but for some reason it doesn't work. so i tried to fire the plugin using  $("#mywizard").wizard()  and get this error:        typeerror: $(...).wizard is not a function     $("mywizard").wizard();      any ideas in how to get this work?     how i include scripts     this is the order in which i include scripts:      script type="text/javascript" src="/bundles/product/js/ / .min.js?0.1"  /script   script type="text/javascript" src="/bundles/product/js/fuelux/all.min.js?0.1"  /script   script type="text/javascript" src="/bundles/stock/js/jquery-impromptu.js?0.1"  /script   script type="text/javascript" src="/bundles/product/js/product.js?0.1"  /script   script      $("mywizard").wizard();  /script
