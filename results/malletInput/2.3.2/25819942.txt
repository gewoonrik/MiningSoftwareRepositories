change the font color of one element in   navbar  i want to change the font color of a link in a   navbar when certain conditions apply. however, it seems that the default font color for navbar links is used regardless if i apply a new css rule.    i have set up a bootply to illustrate my approach:     example     i am using   2.3.2. is it possible to change the font color of just one element in a   navbar?
