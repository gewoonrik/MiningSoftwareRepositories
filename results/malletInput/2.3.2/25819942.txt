Change the font color of one element in   navbar  I want to change the font color of a link in a   navbar when certain conditions apply. However, it seems that the default font color for navbar links is used regardless if I apply a new CSS rule.    I have set up a bootply to illustrate my approach:     example     I am using   2.3.2. Is it possible to change the font color of just one element in a   navbar?
