Twitter   typeahead to autocomplete on continuing to enter on same input form  I'm using twitter   2.3.2 , Here is the html snippet to use typeahead feature         Typeahead works and suggests auto-completion during the first suggestion in the input box , but after i continue typing in the same input box it doesnt make anyother suggestion, why is it that it works only for the first suggestion and doesnt work as i continue entering data in the same text box ?? How to resolve this ??
