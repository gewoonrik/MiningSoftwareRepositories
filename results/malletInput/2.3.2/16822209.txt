Bootstrap collapse ie9 toggling  This is driving me nuts.  I am sure it's something easy, but I just can't see it.    I am trying to use twitter   to open/close a form.  Of course, works fine on chrome, but not IE9.  I create a simple js fiddle that works in both:         If I add the alert in there, I can see that the form is showing and hiding again immediately.    Using twitter   2.3.2 and jQuery 1.9.1.  My code is included after   plugin, etc. EDIT: Never mind.  The click event was attached to an icon.  It worked when I used a div, though no idea why??
