  collapse ie9 toggling  this is driving me nuts.  i am sure it's something easy, but i just can't see it.    i am trying to use     to open/close a form.  of course, works fine on chrome, but not ie9.  i create a simple js fiddle that works in both:         if i add the alert in there, i can see that the form is showing and hiding again immediately.    using     2.3.2 and jquery 1.9.1.  my code is included after   plugin, etc. edit: never mind.  the click event was attached to an icon.  it worked when i used a div, though no idea why??
