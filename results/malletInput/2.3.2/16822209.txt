  collapse ie9 toggling  this is driving me nuts.  i am sure it's something easy, but i just can't see it.    i am trying to use     to open/close a form.  of course, works fine on chrome, but not ie9.  i create a simple js fiddle that works in both:      div class="container"       div id='s'  this works  /div       button id='b' toggle /button    /div  $(document).ready(-  $('#s').collapse(toggle: true)  $('#b').click(-     $('#s').collapse('toggle') ) )      however, when i do (what looks to be exactly the same) in my app, it doesn't work.      $(document).ready(-   $('#phone_call_form').collapse(toggle: true ) $('#addphone').click(-    $('#phone_call_form').collapse('toggle')   # alert('this holds things up long enough for me to see form is opening and immediately closing') )  # handlers for the buttons $('#phone_call_save').click(-    $('#new_phone_call').submit()   $('#phone_call_form').collapse('hide') ) $('#phone_call_cancel').click(-      $('#phone_call_form').collapse('hide') )  )      if i add the alert in there, i can see that the form is showing and hiding again immediately.    using     2.3.2 and jquery 1.9.1.  my code is included after   plugin, etc. edit: never mind.  the click event was attached to an icon.  it worked when i used a div, though no idea why??
