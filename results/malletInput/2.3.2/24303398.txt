why is .active() not working with typehead  we are using  typehead  for autocomplete with   2.3,   -typeahead.js . though typeahead is a jquery plugin,  jquery.active  is always  0  even when it is trying to get suggestions from server.    does  jquery.active  working only for jquery ajax requests? is there any alternative to  jquery.active  if i use any plugins rather than  jquery.ajax  to get information from server.
