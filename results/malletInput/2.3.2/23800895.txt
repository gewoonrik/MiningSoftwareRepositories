Keep dropdown menu open Bootstrap 2.3.2 on Rails 4.0  I am using dropdown on Bootstrap 2.3.2 on Rails 4.0 and I am trying to keep the dropdown menu open even after clicking a button from the dropdown menu (so I only want it to close when I re-click the dropdown-toggle element)    I tried to follow the solution here    =   to no avail...Below is what I tried to do on my html.erb to make it work. Please tell me what I am doing wrong or if you have a better working solution, let me know. Any hint would be much appreciated, thanks in advance!
