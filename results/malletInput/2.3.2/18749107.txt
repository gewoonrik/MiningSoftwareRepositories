aligning button and text in navbar in      i have written the following html with   2.3.2 included and no other css:      div class="navbar navbar-fixed-top"       div class="navbar-inner"           div class="container"              (...)              div class="nav-collapse collapse"                   ul class="nav"                      (...)                  /ul                   form id="login-form" class="navbar-form pull-right"                       span class="navbar-text" hello, username! /span                       button id="logout" class="btn" log out /button                   /form               /div           /div       /div   /div       how can i make it so that the log out button aligns with the text and  .navbar  correctly? currently the button sticks to the bottom of the line, which is the bottom of the  .navbar  because of the  .navbar-text .    the problem can be viewed  here .
