why no line break after input in    here is the code that i'm using for a simple form.  i pretty much copied the entire form from the example on  's website, and removed all controls except a text input and the submit button.      form       fieldset           legend about you /legend           input class="input-medium" type="text" placeholder="first name"           button type="submit" class="btn" get started /button       /fieldset   /form       for some reason, the submit button doesn't drop to a new line when it comes right after an input.         you'll see, if i just add the checkbox w/ label back from the example, the submit button drops to a new line as expected.      form       fieldset           legend about you /legend           input class="input-medium" type="text" placeholder="first name"           label class="checkbox"               input type="checkbox"  check me out          /label           button type="submit" class="btn" get started /button       /fieldset   /form            what am i doing wrong?  i'm using the latest   css and js (2.3.2), loaded from  cdn.com.
