Is there a way to use Glyphicons from Bootstrap 3 in the v2.x  Is it possible to use the Glyphicons from Bootstrap 3 in Bootstrap 2.3.x ?    Problem is, i have a project with a old Bootstrap (2.3.2).    Since there were a major updates in BS3 with the grid system, i can't replace the   version so easy. It is very big project and to would take to much time to change it.    Actually everything works fine. Now my problem is, i am used to use BS3 and i also like the Glyphicons in there and now i thought i could may use them in my project.    Is there a "easy" way to do this ?
