is there a way to use glyphicons from   3 in the v2.x  is it possible to use the glyphicons from   3 in   2.3.x ?    problem is, i have a project with a old   (2.3.2).    since there were a major updates in bs3 with the grid system, i can't replace the   version so easy. it is very big project and to would take to much time to change it.    actually everything works fine. now my problem is, i am used to use bs3 and i also like the glyphicons in there and now i thought i could may use them in my project.    is there a "easy" way to do this ?
