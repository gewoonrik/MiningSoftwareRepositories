collision detection in   dropdown  i am using     for a  drop down menu. there is a case where if the element that  opens the dropdown is at the bottom of the page the menu opens below it and gives a scroll to the page. i want to use collision detection here and in such cases, the menu should open above instead of below. in   2.3.2 there is an option of drop up but if i use that, in all the cases the menu will open on top.  are there any   based plugins for this? or can i use jquery ui position api along with   dropdown.    code: normal   dropdown              for the scenario see :
