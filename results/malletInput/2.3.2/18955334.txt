Collision Detection in   dropdown  I am using Twitter Bootstrap for a  drop down menu. There is a case where if the element that  opens the dropdown is at the bottom of the page the menu opens below it and gives a scroll to the page. I want to use collision detection here and in such cases, the menu should open above instead of below. In   2.3.2 there is an option of drop up but If I use that, in all the cases the menu will Open on top.  Are there any   based plugins for this? Or can I use jQuery UI position api along with   dropdown.    Code: Normal   dropdown              For the scenario see :
