Orchard Projections & Collapse Accordion  I've created a custom content type and a Projection page of them, but cannot shoehorn all the various Parts and Fields into a Bootstrap  Collapse .     I am encountering two problems: I have too many characters in the Layout's Property Rewrite Results; or if I add, for example,   error; or something similar depending upon my layout.     The custom content type definition is:     Fields:       Sponsor (Text Field)    ​Funding Opportunity (Link Field)    ​Funding Title (Text Field)   Closing/Due Date (Text Field)    Funding Opportunity   Number (Text Field)   Accordion Collapse Number (Text Field)       Parts:       Body      I need the Funding Title to be the Accordion-Heading; and all the remaining Fields   Parts to be the Accordion-Inner.    There is a lot of content, and Bootstrap's Collapse requires a lot of markup, so obviously I am getting the "too many characters" error if I go the Token/Rewrite Results route for the Accordion-Inner.    Yet I don't know enough MVC/Razor to determine why I'm getting the Model.ContentItem errors.    Any help would be appreciated, be it somehow combining the Tokens in the Rewrite Output to save characters; or a way to display the various @Model.ContentItem.FunOpp.xxx.Value
