orchard projections & collapse accordion  i've created a custom content type and a projection page of them, but cannot shoehorn all the various parts and fields into a    collapse .     i am encountering two problems: i have too many characters in the layout's property rewrite results; or if i add, for example,  @display(model.contentitem.funopp.funtitle.value)  to the custom .cshtml shape, i get a  'orchard.contentmanagement.contentitem' does not contain a definition for 'funopp'  error; or something similar depending upon my layout.     the custom content type definition is:     fields:       sponsor (text field)    ​funding opportunity (link field)    ​funding title (text field)   closing/due date (text field)    funding opportunity   number (text field)   accordion collapse number (text field)       parts:       body      i need the funding title to be the accordion-heading; and all the remaining fields   parts to be the accordion-inner.    there is a lot of content, and  's collapse requires a lot of markup, so obviously i am getting the "too many characters" error if i go the token/rewrite results route for the accordion-inner.    yet i don't know enough mvc/razor to determine why i'm getting the model.contentitem errors.    any help would be appreciated, be it somehow combining the tokens in the rewrite output to save characters; or a way to display the various @model.contentitem.funopp.xxx.value
