full width tabs using    i'm trying to adjust   tabs to make them span the full width of their container. here's my code (a minimal working example):      !doctype html   html lang="en"       head           meta charset="utf-8"           title full width tabs using   /title           link href="http:// .github.com/ /assets/css/ .css" rel="stylesheet"           style              .full-width-tabs   ul.nav.nav-tabs {                 display: table;                 width: 100%;                 table-layout: fixed; /* to make all "columns" equal width regardless of content */             }             .full-width-tabs   ul.nav.nav-tabs   li {                 float: none;                 display: table-cell;             }             .full-width-tabs   ul.nav.nav-tabs   li   a {                 text-align: center;             }          /style       /head       body           div class="tabbable full-width-tabs"               ul class="nav nav-tabs"                   li class="active"  a href="#tab-one" data-toggle="tab" tab 1 /a  /li                   li  a href="#tab-two" data-toggle="tab" tab 2 /a  /li               /ul               div class="tab-content"                   div class="tab-pane active" id="tab-one"                      i'm in tab 1.                  /div                   div class="tab-pane" id="tab-two"                      howdy, i'm in tab 2. howdy, i'm in tab 2. howdy, i'm in tab 2. howdy, i'm in tab 2.                   /div                 /div            /div   !-- /tabbable --            script src=" "  /script           script src="  cdn.com/ - /2.3.2/js/ .min.js"  /script        /body   /html       i get this (undesired) result:         however, i want the tab "headers" to span the entire width of the tab container - and distribute their individual width's evenly, something like this  desired  result:         how do i achieve that?     update 1:  here's a jsfiddle:         update 2:  i already had a working widget using custom javascript. however, i'm looking for a solution that integrates seemlessly with   and thus relies only on standard   javascript.     update 3:  if i remove / comment out      /* table-layout: fixed; */      header widths are taking up all horizontal space as needed. however, their widths are resulting from the length of the header texts and thus not distributed evenly.    this is  not  what i want either:          update 4:  the upcoming   3 appears to have full-width tabs as a standard component using the class  .nav-justified :    3 -> navs -> justified nav
