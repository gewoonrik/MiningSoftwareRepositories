How does   restrict minimum page width to 400px  I've noticed that in all the examples/tutorials for twitter   that when you attempt to shrink the width of the browser it stops at 400px. e.g:         .com/2.3.2/examples/fluid.html             I've examined the CSS and HTML through Chrome (Version 28.0.1500.95) and cannot figure out how it achieves this. I feel I'm missing something really obvious.    The reason I ask this is that I've followed the tutorials and I believe I've done everything required but it does not restrict the size to 400px. If I understood how the examples achieved this then perhaps I can resolve the issue within my own CSS/HTML.
