how does   restrict minimum page width to 400px  i've noticed that in all the examples/tutorials for     that when you attempt to shrink the width of the browser it stops at 400px. e.g:         .com/2.3.2/examples/fluid.html             i've examined the css and html through chrome (version 28.0.1500.95) and cannot figure out how it achieves this. i feel i'm missing something really obvious.    the reason i ask this is that i've followed the tutorials and i believe i've done everything required but it does not restrict the size to 400px. if i understood how the examples achieved this then perhaps i can resolve the issue within my own css/html.
