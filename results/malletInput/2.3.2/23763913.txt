dropdown submenus in angularjs?  i wanted to make dropdown submenus similar to how they have it in   as denoted on this link under  dropdown-submenu .       .com/2.3.2/components.html#dropdowns     anyways i was wondering, is there anyway integrate or incorporate this into my application via angularjs? my code is as follows for creating a dropdown that i wanted. for each entry inside my dropdown, i wanted to create a submenu that, once you hover over them, you would be able to view the submenu (which would be the same for every entry). the following is my code for the dropdown:      select class="span4" ng-model="create.activitytypename" multiple ng-options="value for value in activitytypes" data-style="btn" bs-select  /select       this dropdown allows me to select multiple entries from the  create.activitytypename  array i have created.     if anyone could help me out, that would be great! thanks!
