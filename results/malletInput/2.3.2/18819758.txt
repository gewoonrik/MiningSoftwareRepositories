Clickable area with background image and text  I'm a front-end novice and am trying to figure out how to build the following in my rails app:           Each image is a company model with the attributes title, subtitle, image, and number of deals. I want the entire area of each separate image to be clickable and link to the "show" action. Also I need to darken the image a to make the text more readable. My question is how to make each individual picture-button.    Currently, I have   deployed on my app via the following gem in my Gemfile:         This seems like it will be a long answer, but I really don't know where to start.
