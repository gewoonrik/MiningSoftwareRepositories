clickable area with background image and text  i'm a front-end novice and am trying to figure out how to build the following in my rails app:           each image is a company model with the attributes title, subtitle, image, and number of deals. i want the entire area of each separate image to be clickable and link to the "show" action. also i need to darken the image a to make the text more readable. my question is how to make each individual picture-button.    currently, i have   deployed on my app via the following gem in my gemfile:     gem ' -sass', '2.3.2.0'      i am using carrierwave to store the images and they are accessible in the views the following way:      %= image_tag @company.image_url %       this seems like it will be a long answer, but i really don't know where to start.
