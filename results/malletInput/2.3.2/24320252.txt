  2.3.2 side content not responding properly to small screen  initial view is like this. no problem here.    but when it responds to small screens it changes to      why the images of right side in single column, they should be in a row until the device width is too small.     the code i am using is       div class="container-fluid"         div class="row-fluid"         div class="span8 border1"  img src="/ /img/a.jpg" /  /div         div class="span4"           div class="row-fluid"                div class="span5 border1"  img src="/ /img/b.jpg" /  /div                 div class="span5 border1"  img src="/ /img/b.jpg" /  /div           /div       /div       /div       /div        jsfiddle here     what wrong i am doing here?    edit: i could not get a good answer here. had to manage it myself. i checked that for screen width less than 700px it gives 100% to all spanx class which is not desirable here. so, i added more rules for smaller screens.      @media (max-width: 320px){ ... } @media (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 730px) { ... }      hope this helps someone.
