Bootstrap 2.3.2 modal not displaying in IE 11  I have inherited an Asp.net site that is using Bootstrap 2.3.2 along with JQuery 1.7.2 and a few other JS libraries.    Part of the site deals with messages to and from users which I display after performing an Ajax call to retrieve the message details and populate the relevant inputs. This works fine in Chrome, Firefox and IE 10.  However in IE 11 I get the following error on the line      The modals are defined in the master file with the javascript being called from an external file.  I've tried placing the JS in the same master file and in the child page, I've also tried changing the order of loading for the libraries with no success.    Ideally I don't want to have to upgrade to the latest version of Bootstrap as I just need to fix issues until the site is rebuilt in the next few months.
