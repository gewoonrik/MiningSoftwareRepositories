 -  responsive navbar dropdown sub-links are unclickable on tablet  i am having trouble getting a link that is in a dropdown menu in the responsive navbar to click while using a tablet. this works fine in a desktop browser, but on a tablet when you click the link the drop down closes and nothing happens. i will post the code i have below, but you can also see it in this jsfiddle     . i am using   v2.3.2 unminified version in my application.         what am i missing here?
