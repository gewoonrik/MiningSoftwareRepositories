symfony2 mopa bundle   2.3.2 styling  i am currently using symfony2 with the mopa  bundle but with  2.3.2.    i am experiencing problems with the styling of symfony forms. what i am trying to achieve is a horizontal form with 3 things on it:     a) an input field b) a collection that uses a subform c) a subform    my current code:         but i still had the same problem when there was an error in the field.    so the first part of my question will be how do i style the field so that it spans 6 and when there is an error everything turns red as it does by default?    my second part will be how do i style subform elements without having to include templates each time?    my final question will be where can i find more examples of styling symfony2 with  2.3.2 that is a bit more complex than the examples on get .com?
