Symfony2 MopaBootstrapBundle Bootstrap 2.3.2 Styling  I am currently using Symfony2 with the MopaBootStrap Bundle but with Bootstrap2.3.2.    I am experiencing problems with the styling of symfony forms. What I am trying to achieve is a horizontal form with 3 things on it:     a) An input field b) A collection that uses a subform c) A subform    My current code:         But I still had the same problem when there was an error in the field.    So the first part of my question will be how do I style the field so that it spans 6 and when there is an error everything turns red as it does by default?    My second part will be how do I style subform elements without having to include templates each time?    My final question will be where can I find more examples of styling symfony2 with  2.3.2 that is a bit more complex than the examples on get .com?
