    collapse - icons with :after  i am using :after to have the icons for the header and everything is pretty self-explanatory until i want to switch between them. i made this fiddle:        because stackoverflow wants me to and because this is the only custom code:         you can see the problem when you click on one and then when it opens, the other one. by clicking another accordion. the :after doesn't change, meaning the icons won't change if i have them there.    what is the best way to do this? i haven't seen an issue like this with using :before/:after, so i'm looking for a solution that is as elegant as possible.    e: i am using   v2.3.2
