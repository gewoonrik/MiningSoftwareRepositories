Twitter   collapse - icons with :after  I am using :after to have the icons for the header and everything is pretty self-explanatory until I want to switch between them. I made this fiddle:        Because stackoverflow wants me to and because this is the only custom code:         You can see the problem when you click on one and then when it opens, the other one. By clicking another accordion. The :after doesn't change, meaning the icons won't change if I have them there.    What is the best way to do this? I haven't seen an issue like this with using :before/:after, so I'm looking for a solution that is as elegant as possible.    E: I am using Bootstrap v2.3.2
