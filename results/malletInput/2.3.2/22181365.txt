Having 3 Fixed column layout  I have 3 fixed columns of width 300px to be placed under a container of 960 px. I used   2.3.2 but figuring out that   3 in mobile first, I switched to it. This is the current structure I am using         Everything is coming under one single column. What is the best way to achieve this? 3 columns of 300px in desktop, 2 columns in tablet (adjusting the padding) and 1 column in mobile.    so a layout would be 15px - 300 - 15px - 300 -15px - 300 - 15px
