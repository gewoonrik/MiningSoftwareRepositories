Collapse nested accordion groups based on custom class  I'm using Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 with Asp.net MVC.    I have a set of nested accordions on a tab pane and other accordions on other tab panes.    The External accordions are in an accordion-group and the Internal accordions are in another group, nested inside each External accordion.         The colours are applied using CSS rules on custom classes.
