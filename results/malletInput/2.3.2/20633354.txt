collapse nested accordion groups based on custom class  i'm using     2.3.2 with asp.net mvc.    i have a set of nested accordions on a tab pane and other accordions on other tab panes.    the external accordions are in an accordion-group and the internal accordions are in another group, nested inside each external accordion.         the colours are applied using css rules on custom classes.
