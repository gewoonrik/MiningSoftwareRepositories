  modal trigger event in incorrect order when jquery mobile css is included  i ran into a case where only backdrop is being display and modal is only displayed after the backdrop is removed. this is the first time i ever ran into this issue after a couple years of using   and i'm not able to figure out why. when debugging, the callback is never triggered on the first pass. it's only triggered after i click on the backdrop.    anyone else ran into this issue before? is it something to do with css conflict potentially? removing jquery-mobile-1.4.2.css seems to help, but i kinda need both of them to work together. the version of   i'm using is 2.3.2.     this.backdrop(function() {     var transition = $.support.transition    that.$element.hasclass('fade')      if (!that.$element.parent().length) {         that.$element.appendto(document.body) //don't move modals dom position     }      that.$element.show()      if (transition) {         that.$element[0].offsetwidth // force reflow     }      that.$element.addclass('in').attr('aria-hidden', false)      that.enforcefocus()      transition ?          that.$element.one($.support.transition.end, function() {             that.$element.focus().trigger('shown')         }) :          that.$element.focus().trigger('shown')     }) }
