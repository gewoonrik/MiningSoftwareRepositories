  modal trigger event in incorrect order when jquery mobile CSS is included  I ran into a case where only backdrop is being display and modal is only displayed after the backdrop is removed. This is the first time I ever ran into this issue after a couple years of using   and I'm not able to figure out why. When debugging, the callback is never triggered on the first pass. It's only triggered after I click on the backdrop.    Anyone else ran into this issue before? Is it something to do with CSS conflict potentially? Removing jquery-mobile-1.4.2.css seems to help, but I kinda need both of them to work together. The version of   I'm using is 2.3.2.
