E003 type error with Bootstrap Glyphicons and JavaFX WebView  I'm have a really weird bug, heres the setup:    I have a web app running in openshift, all is good and runs great in Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Android WebView.    But because I need some hardware level access for a few functions, I created a JavaFX application running a WebView with a JavaScript interface for the hardware functions.    Everything works and runs (although with low FPS) except for the Bootstrap 3 Glyphicons.     Here is a screenshot from Chrome:           Here is a screenshot from JavaFX WebView           The RIA, client side is running:   -Bootstrap 3 and Glyphicons (from the CDN)  -Bootstrap Modal (from the server)  -JQuery 2.0.3 (from CDN)  -AngularJS (from CDN)        UPDATE:   After some testing, it appears that Glyphicons from Bootstrap 2.3.2 do work as expected inside JavaFX. But I'm not willing to go back to BS 2.3.2
