what replaces nav lists in   3?  i am preparing to update my site to   3, but i canâ€™t figure out how to replace  the  nav-list  class from   2 .    i looked into  list groups , but i am not sure if this is to be used to replace nav lists. how would i make the below markup work in   3?      div class="well"       ul class="nav nav-list"           li  a href="#" link 1 /a  /li           li  a href="#" link 2 /a  /li       /ul   /div       edit    this is the look i am going for:
