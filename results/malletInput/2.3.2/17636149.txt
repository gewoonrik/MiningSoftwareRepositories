need to load  -dropdown.js after  .js to make dropdown work - why?  new to   and  javascript  and was trying to build a fairly minimal example of a dropdown menu.  i am using    2.3.2  which is the current version.  my  css  and  js  are visible in my ide.  from the     docs it seems that a standard install of   .js  contains   -dropdown.js  and i can see it in the file.  yet, i need to have the following for the drop down menu to work:      script src=" "  /script   script src="assets/js/ .min.js"  /script   script src="assets/js/ .js"  /script   script src="http:// .github.com/ /assets/js/ -dropdown.js"  /script       why do i have to load   -dropdown.js  separately if it is included in   .js ?  obviously there is something fundamental here that i don't understand. thanks.
