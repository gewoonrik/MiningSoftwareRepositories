Executing JQuery from a MVC4 JavaScript Callback function  I'm using MVC4 and I'm doing a simple post back using the below code. However, out everything I've tried I haven't been able to perform JQuery functions inside the JS function but I haven't been able to use any callback functions inside the JQuery block either. Is what I'm trying to do possible? Is there another way of doing this i.e. just make the ajax callback in JQuery? I'm trying to call a twitter   function.     Edit : Alert as how I'm using is a Twitter Bootstrapper function     .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#alerts     My Callback function
