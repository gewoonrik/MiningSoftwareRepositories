How to make twitter   fixed width modal pop up scrollable on resizing screen width  In my page I have a twitter boostrap 2.3.2 modal pop up with fixed width. I want it to scroll horizontally in small screen resolutions . I dont want responsive modal pop up which changes size according to screen resolution. Please Suggest    Please check the  jsfiddle   example by resizing screen size, You can see both sides of the pop is not visible on resizing window and also there is no scroll bar to view the pop up completely         });
