weird tabbable error - one nav-tab doing strange layout things  i'm working on a tabbable nav setup for my company's case studies page -     - and when you select extremereach (click the logo below the tab-content section), it pulls the next logo (segment.io) in underneath it from the far left side of the page.    can't figure out why. any help would be massively appreciated.    fwiw, i'm still on   2.3.2    edit to add the code.
