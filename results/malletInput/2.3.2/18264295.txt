function select2() lost after forward from servlet  I am using  Bootstrap2.3.2  and  Select2 3.4.2  in jsp file. I want to override the Bootstrap select style by Select2 library. It works when jsp file is loaded in the first time, but after submitting the selection to servlet and forward back to the same jsp from servlet, I found the function select2() of select object has lost, and the select box change to Bootstrap style. It looks like select2.js has no effect, Why is that? Please help.    Following is my code snippet    selectCategory.jsp:         I thought the second included select2.js in file2.jsp should take effect, but it doesn't
