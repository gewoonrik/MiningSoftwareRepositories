    layout strange behaviour  i have a strange behaviour in screen layout, i do not understand the possible cause:(  i have a vertical grey line on the left and the right of the screen,     see screenshot here:         btw, i developed using rails 3 and using     2.3.2     in facts i do not foresee / i do not want these lines ... i presume it could be some css setting (on my one customization css code...), sorry for my ignorance there,    watching the shot here do suggest you something about why the grey vertical line on the left marging and the right margin of the screen layout ?    thanks a lot  giorgio     scss customization file used:
