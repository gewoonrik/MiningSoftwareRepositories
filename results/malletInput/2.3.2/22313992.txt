dynamically build     modal  i am building a rails application, and i want to place the content from a rails partial into the modal via ajax.    in a     2.3.2 modal, i read via the documentation that you can load content via ajax using the remote key.         .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#modals     however, this only allows content to be injected into the  .modal-body , rather than building the whole modal dynamically.      is there a way to build the entire modal, including  .modal-header ,  .modal-footer , dynamically with js?     it seems very clunky to do this with a string, like follows:     partial = render_to_string(:partial =  'some-partial').gsub(%{"}, %{'}).gsub(/'/,"\\\\'").gsub("\n", "")
