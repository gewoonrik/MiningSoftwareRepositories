  tooltip toggles wrong sometimes?  i've realized that the    2.3.2  tooltip doesn't always work properly. i'm having this problem in :      chrome 35.0.1916.114 m   firefox 29.0.1   opera 21.0.1432.67    safari 5.1.7      it seems to work well in ie 9.    if you move the mouse over the tooltip element quite fast (up and down, for example, or right and left), there's a point in which the tooltip won't show when you have the mouse over the element which is suppose to show it.    you can easily reproduce it in  this fiddle .         did anyone find a solution for this?       update    it looks like the bug still taking place in    3.1.1 . it seems more difficult to be reproduced, but you still can get it by moving the mouse up and down quite fast for a short distance over and outside the element.     fiddle  to reproduce it.
