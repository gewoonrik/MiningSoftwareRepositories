customize   dropdown code for nav menu  i'm trying to modify the   dropdown js code to add/remove a class to a div earlier in the code, as oppose to the parent li, which it currently uses as the target for the class toggling. my js skills are admittedly not where i would like them to be, but i'm sure this is a pretty easy one for someone with a little more experience! i have setup a codepen as well as jsfiddle-- the goal is to toggle class 'open' to the div #navbar-container on clicking the dropdown li item 'products'
