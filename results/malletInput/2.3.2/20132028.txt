how to make     textarea responsive  so i have a   page and i just noticed that on resizing the textarea won't scale responsively like everything else on the page when i have a window at half-width it looks like so:     then when i resize to full screen i get this:   and it's not until i refresh the browser that i get the desired response which is this:       rails code :      h1 sign in /h1   div class="container-fluid"     div class="row-fluid"       div class="span6 offset3"         %= form_for(:session, url: sessions_path) do |f| %            %= f.label :email %           %= f.email_field :email%            %= f.label :password %           %= f.password_field :password %         % end %       /div     /div   /div        html code :  (unnecessary stuff removed)       h1 sign in /h1   div class="container-fluid"     div class="row-fluid"       div class="span6 offset3"         form            label for="session_email" email /label           input id="session_email" name="session[email]" type="email" /            label for="session_password" password /label           input id="session_password" name="session[password]" type="password" /         /form       /div     /div   /div       i'm using     2.3.2 (legacy i know but i need to interface with the rest of a site) and tested on chrome and firefox on arch.     css :     .input {     display: block;     width: 100%;     min-height: 30px;     -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;     -moz-box-sizing: border-box;     box-sizing: border-box; }      seems like this should be a pretty simple fix but looking around i can't find what to do to fix this. looking  here  it definitely seems possible (the inputs with the span tags seem to resize on size change). thanks in advance.    edit: i tried to make a  jsfiddle  to illustrate the problem and allow people to tinker but this suffers from a different responsive problem, bonus points will come for showing how to fix that too :)    edit #2: ok, so this is weird, i dug even further into this, the width of the element is set in element.style but i'm having trouble figuring out where this is set (iirc element.style is set in javascript, this does not happen in the jsfiddle and is what is causing my problem, i can't figure out why it is happening as i don't have any custom javascript for this and i am using the same version of   for both (though in my actual project it is vendored from  -sass gem)    edit #3 added css
