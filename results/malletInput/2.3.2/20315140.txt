How to set a minimum width to a webpage in twitter   2.3.2  Would it be possible to set a minimum width on a responsive layout where it would not re-size the webpage beyond that specified point. For example set the width to be 468 px Min and add scroll bars to any devise/browser which has any width less than that ?      My site breaks up in mobile phones after a certain width , almost impossible to replicate the same site on desktop when it becomes too small .
