how to set/active   tooltip using javascript?  i'm so frustrated that i cannot solve this simple question.  how to programmingly set/active   tooltip?     for example, we are at page:    .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#tooltips  and let's open the chrome console and make tooltip work on the fly on the 'home' link in the left up corner.      var home = $($('.navbar li a')[0]);// select that home link home.tooltip({title:'wthhhh'}); // set the default title home.tooltip('show');      step 3 doesn't bring up the tooltip.     any help?     edit: i understand   has got a major update, but i believe it's irrelevant. tooltip doesn't seem change.
