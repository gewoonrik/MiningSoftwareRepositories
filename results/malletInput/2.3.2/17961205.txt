How to set/active   tooltip using javascript?  I'm so frustrated that I cannot solve this simple question.  How to programmingly set/active   tooltip?     For example, we are at page:    .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#tooltips  and let's open the chrome console and make tooltip work on the fly on the 'home' link in the left up corner.          Step 3 doesn't bring up the tooltip.     Any help?     EDIT: I understand   has got a major update, but I believe it's irrelevant. Tooltip doesn't seem change.
