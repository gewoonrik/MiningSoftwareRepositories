resetting zebra style after removing rows from table  i have a table that, with  , uses  :nth-child  to style alternating table rows. however, whenever i remove a row with jquery  .hide()  the alternating rows break.     html:      script src="//netdna. cdn.com/ - /2.3.2/js/ .min.js"  /script   table id='t1' class="table table-bordered table-striped table-condensed table-hover table-even-widths"       thead           tr               th heading a /th               th heading b /th               th heading c /th           /tr       /thead       tbody           tr id='r1'               td 0 /td               td b /td               td c /td           /tr           tr id='r2'               td 1 /td               td b /td               td c /td           /tr           tr id='r3'               td 2 /td               td b /td               td c /td           /tr           tr id='r4'               td 3 /td               td b /td               td c /td           /tr           tr id='r5'               td 4 /td               td b /td               td c /td           /tr       /tbody   /table       js:     $('#r4').hide();             i was wondering if there was an easy way to sort of reset the table with the new configuration. i can always make my own  .even  and  .odd  class and filter through the table after every update to remove and reapply the classes, but was hoping for a more elegant solution.
