css broken with inline-block in safari - width of zero not set  i am trying to create a horizontal accordion in     (2.3.2). i have found some css online that works very well and allows me to utilize the existing js. this all works great - except in safari (ios and windows). in safari the collapsed element still retains some width  even though the width is correctly set to 0px.    i have created a fiddle:        the css i am using is:     .accordion-group, .accordion-heading, .accordion-body {     display:inline-block; } .collapse {     height:auto;     width:auto } .collapse.height {     height:0;     -webkit-transition:height .35s ease;     -moz-transition:height .35s ease;     -o-transition:height .35s ease;     transition:height .35s ease; } .collapse.width {     width:0;     -webkit-transition:width .35s ease;     -moz-transition:width .35s ease;     -o-transition:width .35s ease;     transition:width .35s ease; } .collapse.width.in {     width:auto } .collapse.height.in {     height:auto }      i am developing on windows and can replicate the problem using the safari downloaded from here:        the problem seems to be with the inline-block elements. can this be fixed with a little sprinkle of css magic?
