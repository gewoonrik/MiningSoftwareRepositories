  modal "covering" other elements when hidden (2.3.2)  i have a   modal that i have tailored with some css.  now when it is hidden, it is covering other elements (which is not allowing me to click links and such).  what could be happening?  what i have seen is that in the modal div it has the style "display:block" even when it is hidden, which could be explaining the issue.  also removing position: absolute from the css solves the problem, but then when the modal comes up, it is not positioned correctly.      html:
