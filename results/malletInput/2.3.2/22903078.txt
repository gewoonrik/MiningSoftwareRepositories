Bootstrap modal "covering" other elements when hidden (2.3.2)  I have a   modal that I have tailored with some CSS.  Now when it is hidden, it is covering other elements (which is not allowing me to click links and such).  What could be happening?  What I have seen is that in the modal div it has the style "display:block" even when it is hidden, which could be explaining the issue.  Also removing position: absolute from the CSS solves the problem, but then when the modal comes up, it is not positioned correctly.      HTML:
