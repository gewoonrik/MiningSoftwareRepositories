Bootstrap "container" background  I've been racking my brains for quite a bit of time but still was not find to find a variant but one I will describe here. Iâ€™m using twitter   2.3.2. I wanted to change the background of the "container". When I applied the changes, this image was also the background of "navbar" and "hero-unit".    The same thing you can discover here:    .com/2.3.2/examples/hero.html  By setting in the "Inspect Element" of the "container" settings smth like this:         But what I need, is that the "hero-unit" and the main content "container" were on one line (as on the link provided above). If they are applied to the "container" class it works, but the background is fairly. What properties do I have to apply to the new class, so as they are of equal size (see the link). I think I'm stuck a bit and badly need some support.    I guess I gotta create two new classes? One for the equal display of the "container" and "hero-unit" and "navbar" and the other (with same property of width) to set the background. But I cant figure it out:(
