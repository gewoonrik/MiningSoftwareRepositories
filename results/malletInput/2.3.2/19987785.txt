calling jsni method in @postconstruct - errai  i'm having an issue trying to call a js function from java using errai 2.3.2  i'm using   switch and i need to invoke a js function in order to activate it. i need to do this after the page is created and all the elements are attached to the dom element.    i've tried it all: @postconstruct, @pageshowing, @pageshown, onattach().. but none of those worked for me.    i have this:     @override public void onattach(){     enabletoggleswitch(); }  public static native void enabletoggleswitch() /*-{     $wnd.enabletoggle(); }-*/;      and when i debug it, it seems to be that the onattach() method is invoked before the elements are attached to the dom.    any ideas?
