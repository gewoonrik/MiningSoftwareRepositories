Ask Toolbar preventing Bootstrap Modal to show  I am facing a bit problem with a project which uses   2.3.2 framework. Users who has  ask toolbar  are unable to see   modal completely as in below given screenshot:          Steps to replicate the issue. Install ask toolbar for Google chrome {if not installed) or if installed and disabled, enable it. Go to Get   documentation website  and click on  Launch demo modal  button to open the modal. The modal will display as shown in the screenshot.     Google Chrome is injecting an iframe with some css to all the pages (generally, html pages) to display the toolbar as chrome doesn't allow to show as inbuilt toolbar. We can disable the toolbar on window load event using following jquery function       hack. But it is not the proper way to do it.    To install ASK Toolbar for chrome, go to     and  click on Download Toolbar button. After downloading, you may need to run the application manually. Finally restart chrome or see for a menu link under chrome wrench (menu at right top side) to activate toolbar.     ## Note: this issue existed in   ver. 2.3.2. Not tested in ver. 3.x.x ##
