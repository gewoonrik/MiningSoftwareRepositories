ask toolbar preventing   modal to show  i am facing a bit problem with a project which uses   2.3.2 framework. users who has  ask toolbar  are unable to see   modal completely as in below given screenshot:          steps to replicate the issue. install ask toolbar for google chrome {if not installed) or if installed and disabled, enable it. go to get   documentation website  and click on  launch demo modal  button to open the modal. the modal will display as shown in the screenshot.     google chrome is injecting an iframe with some css to all the pages (generally, html pages) to display the toolbar as chrome doesn't allow to show as inbuilt toolbar. we can disable the toolbar on window load event using following jquery function          $(window).load(function () {         $('.apn-toolbar').remove();         $('#apn-body-style').remove();     });      however on initiation of   modal some data attributes being added by the ask toolbar extension, to the modal wrapper div which is preventing to display the modal fully.    the data attributes are as below:   div id="mymodal" class="modal hide fade in" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="mymodallabel" aria-hidden="false" style="display: block; top: -138px;" data-apn-tb_demo_v7-toolbar_set="top" data-apn-tb_demo_v7-toolbar_set_top="undefined" data-apn-toolbar-adjusted="-138px"   instead of   div id="mymodal" class="modal hide fade in" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="mymodallabel" aria-hidden="false" style="display: block;"      how to get rid of style  top  negative value and  data-apn-tb_demo_v7-toolbar_set="top" data-apn-tb_demo_v7-toolbar_set_top="undefined" data-apn-toolbar-adjusted="-138px"  from the modal or      edit:    completely disable ask toolbar while accessing the website without forcing the user to disable or uninstall ask toolbar manually?   because the toolbar is creating some other problems as well. i have fixed top bar and jquery ui tooltips. also, using  window.scroll() and scrolltop()  function to fix another div next to top menu bar. if ask toolbar is activated, the scroll method is fixing the div beyond to the top bar. also, tooltips are getting 31px of top margin of ask toolbar.       edit:  i can fix the issue by giving  .modal.fade.in { top: 10% !important;}  hack. but it is not the proper way to do it.    to install ask toolbar for chrome, go to     and  click on download toolbar button. after downloading, you may need to run the application manually. finally restart chrome or see for a menu link under chrome wrench (menu at right top side) to activate toolbar.     ## note: this issue existed in   ver. 2.3.2. not tested in ver. 3.x.x ##
