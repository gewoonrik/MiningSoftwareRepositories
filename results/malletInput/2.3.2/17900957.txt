  icons not working  i'm trying to use  these  icons for my  site .  i already downloaded  , and have a   .css  file.  if i download all of  , it messes my site up, so i downloaded a customized version.  i forgot to download the icons, so what i did was download a customized   with only the icons, and then copy and pasted that into my old   .css  file.  however, the icon i was trying to use didn't work.    so then what i did was i tried moving my old   .css  file out of  vendor/assets/stylesheets  and into  vendor/assets , and i put the new   .css  file (with only the icons styling) into  vendor/assets/stylesheets .  when i did that, the icon still didn't show.  so i removed the new   .css  file, and i put the old one back into  vender/assets/stylesheets .  however... now none of the   styling works!!! i have no clue why that is!    i tried restarting my web server, clearing my cache, i checked to see if there is an assets folder in my public folder (because when there is i can't see css changes using localhost.  something to do with compiling).  none of it worked, and i still can't see any of the   styling in my localhost.  when i use inspect element, i don't see the   styles being applied.  i'm afraid to update the actual site, because i might loose the   styling.  if you want me to update it so you can see it and help me and are confident that i won't lose the   styling, i'll trust you and do it.  let me know.    error:     sass::syntaxerror in static_pages#home  showing /users/adamzerner/collegeanswerz/app/views/static_pages/home.html.erb where line #1 raised:  invalid css after "...ground-position": expected ";", was ": center;"   (in /users/adamzerner/collegeanswerz/app/assets/stylesheets/home.css.scss) extracted source (around line #1):  1:  %= stylesheet_link_tag    "home", :media =  "all" %  2:  %= javascript_include_tag :application %  3:  % provide(:title, 'questions about college?  collegeanswerz') %  4:  rails.root: /users/adamzerner/collegeanswerz  application trace | framework trace | full trace app/assets/stylesheets/ .css:1939 app/assets/stylesheets/home.css.scss:1 app/views/static_pages/home.html.erb:1:in `_app_views_static_pages_home_html_erb__737002310770935096_70160250580000' request  parameters:  none show session dump  show env dump  response  headers:  none
