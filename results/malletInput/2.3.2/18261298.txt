Can't get the right number of spans on a row  I'm having a problem with the most basic of Bootstrap (2.3.2) structures, I can't seem to get 4x 3spans in/on a row. The fourth one gets pushed down a level. I get the same result when adding a link to the responsive css file. I can't get them to "fit" in one line without playing around with the margins, but I shouldn't have/need to. Thanks a lot for your help! K
