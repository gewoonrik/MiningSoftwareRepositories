  dropdown not closing on item click  i have a   (version 2.3.2) dropdown within a nav ul element as per the html below.  when i click an item in the dropdown in ie then the drop down list closes - this seems to be the correct behaviour - and is certainly what i want.  in firefox, chrome and safari the drop down list does not close.         i know there were some problems with this in an earlier version of  , however i have not been able to find anything detailing similar problems in the current version.
