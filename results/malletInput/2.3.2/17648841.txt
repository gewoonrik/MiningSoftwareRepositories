Bootstrap Dropdown Not Closing On Item Click  I have a Bootstrap (version 2.3.2) dropdown within a nav ul element as per the HTML below.  When I click an item in the dropdown in IE then the drop down list closes - this seems to be the correct behaviour - and is certainly what I want.  In Firefox, Chrome and Safari the drop down list does not close.         I know there were some problems with this in an earlier version of  , however I have not been able to find anything detailing similar problems in the current version.
