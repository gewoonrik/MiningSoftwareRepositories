Twitter Bootstrap misplaced thumbnails  I'm writing a profile page with TwiBoo (2.3.2) composed of a row, a span7 for the person projects, then a span5 for buttons:         This is the result:         The problem comes when I add more thumbnails and goes to a new line, where instead of 3 per line I only get 2 from second line on:         I tried fixing the left-margin with plain css but just moves ALL the thumbs left keeping the same problem. Any idea on why?
