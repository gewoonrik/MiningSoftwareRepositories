    misplaced thumbnails  i'm writing a profile page with twiboo (2.3.2) composed of a row, a span7 for the person projects, then a span5 for buttons:         this is the result:         the problem comes when i add more thumbnails and goes to a new line, where instead of 3 per line i only get 2 from second line on:         i tried fixing the left-margin with plain css but just moves all the thumbs left keeping the same problem. any idea on why?
