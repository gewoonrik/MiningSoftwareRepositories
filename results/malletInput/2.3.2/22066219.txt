Call of   collapse('show') hide element only the first time  I'm using Bootstrap v2.3.2 with a collapse element.    My accordion looks like this:      , the element will hide except of showing, but only on first call and only if i don't collapse the element clicking on it before that. I think i forgot a HTML element, but i can't see any difference into DOM...      Fiddle   : click on the 'click me' button without clicking on collapsible element before.       Already try: add $accordion.collapse({toggle:true}) (   /issues/5859 ) but it didn't worked...
