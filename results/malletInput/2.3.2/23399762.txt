Bootstrap Nav Menu active link indicator  I have a site that I am working on in wordpress using parallax scrolling and   V 2.3.2.    I have two questions regarding the nav menu bar:       Can anyone offer some suggestions on getting the nav bar to stay at the top of the page when I scroll back to the top?     This is related to above question. When I scroll to the top and go back to the "home section" the second section "Creative Services" is still highlighted even though that is not the active page. I would like to have it return to it's normal (white) state.        Link to my website
