  nav menu active link indicator  i have a site that i am working on in wordpress using parallax scrolling and   v 2.3.2.    i have two questions regarding the nav menu bar:       can anyone offer some suggestions on getting the nav bar to stay at the top of the page when i scroll back to the top?     this is related to above question. when i scroll to the top and go back to the "home section" the second section "creative services" is still highlighted even though that is not the active page. i would like to have it return to it's normal (white) state.        link to my website
