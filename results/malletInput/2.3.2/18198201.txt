Scroll Spy Get Stuck on top, doesn't follow the scroll  I am copying the exact same code and resources from    .com/components     However, I don't understand why only in my copy, whenever I refresh the page, the entire ul list will get stuck in its position, therefore, if I scroll down, the ul will go off the screen.    This is my version:     Scroll Spy Get Stuck     If I do not refresh, the ul works as it should and follow wherever I scroll with the submenu being highlighted... The JQuery that set the   class is correct. I have no idea at all how this could happen... any help will be highly appreciated! Thanks!    NOTE:      -. It works on the original site   -. It works on chrome   -. Bootstrap 2.3.2 version works fine
