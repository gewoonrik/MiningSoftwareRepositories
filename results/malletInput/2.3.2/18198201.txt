scroll spy get stuck on top, doesn't follow the scroll  i am copying the exact same code and resources from    .com/components     however, i don't understand why only in my copy, whenever i refresh the page, the entire ul list will get stuck in its position, therefore, if i scroll down, the ul will go off the screen.    this is my version:     scroll spy get stuck     if i do not refresh, the ul works as it should and follow wherever i scroll with the submenu being highlighted... the jquery that set the   class is correct. i have no idea at all how this could happen... any help will be highly appreciated! thanks!    note:      -. it works on the original site   -. it works on chrome   -.   2.3.2 version works fine
