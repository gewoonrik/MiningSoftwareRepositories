How can I add panels to an existing carousel?  For one of my client's brochure websites, I am using the  Bootstrap carousel . The carousel has 6 panels, each displaying a fairly large image.    To speed initial load time, I'm toying with the idea of only including two panels in the page's source, and somehow using JavaScript to append additional panels after the page is loaded to the DOM. That is, I want to   lazy load   additional panels to the carousel; hopefully they'll be in place before the carousel needs to display them (my carousel is set to change panels every 4 seconds, so two initial panels gives me 8 seconds to append a third panel).
