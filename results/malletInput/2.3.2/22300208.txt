website text appearing only on hover  i'm facing a strange issue on the text rendering of a website i have developed. when loading the page, some of the text doesn't appear until i hover over it; some not even then.     i am using font-face. if i reload the page, it works fine. if i empty the cache, the problem comes back. frontend design is developed using   2.3.2.
