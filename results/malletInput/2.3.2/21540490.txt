resizing a slickgrid column header causes it to be misaligned with body  i am using slickgrid 2.2 with   3.1.0 css.  when i try to resize the column header, the column header cell is not aligned with the cell in the body.  the header is consistently larger than the body whether i am shrinking or stretching it.  i am using the code from example 1:    html      div id="mygrid" style="width:600px;height:500px;"       javascript      var grid;  var columns = [{      id: "title",      name: "title",      field: "title"  }];   var options = {      enablecellnavigation: true,      enablecolumnreorder: false  };   $(function () {      var data = [];          data[0] = {              title: "task ",              duration: "5 days",              percentcomplete: math.round(math.random() * 100),              start: "01/01/2009",              finish: "01/05/2009",              effortdriven: 10          };       grid = new slick.grid("#mygrid", data, columns, options);  })             in   2.3.2, the resizing seems to work as expected.    i have noticed a post about a similar issue at    .  there it seems to indicate that a rendering issue was fixed, however i believe my condition, where the item is resized, is still not working.
