Bootstrap Modal inputs lose focus on click  I am working on 2   modals that both lie on the same page. Bootstrap 2.3.2    The issue I'm experiencing is that whenever the modal appears, the first time you click on any of the inputs in the modal, it will immediately lose focus. After that, focus functions fine, it's just the first time.    I've found some similar issues out there, but none of their solutions have worked for me so far. Here's what I've tried:    1.)         I've pretty much exhausted google at this point, and I can't think of a way to even debug why this is happening. Either an answer or a suggested route to try would be greatly appreciated.
