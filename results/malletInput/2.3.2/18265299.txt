Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 the navbar is showing lot of white space after collapsing  I am using Bootstrap 2.3.2, my page has navbar that gets responsive and get collapsed when it is opened in a small devices or the browser window size is lowered.    How ever it is causing about 60px padding between the top of the browser and collapsed navbar.    When I inspect in firebug i notice the body tag getting a style element from core.css padding-top:60px;    this is causing the collapsed navbar to go down creating a white space at top for 60px, i could overide the style attribute, but thought of asking here if any one noticed this behavior and if the style overiding is the right solution for this?
