can we use font awesome 3.2 with     3?  i am primarily a java developer but in the current project i will be doing the ui part also and i am thinking of using      3.0  version. i know for icons it comes with  glyphyicons  but today i came to know about something called  font awesome 3.2  as well for icons which is considered to be better than the glyphyicons. however i noticed that font awesome 3.2 has been designed and is widely used with previous version of      2.3.2 .     does anyone know if      3.0  will also support the  font awesome 3.2 ? if so, what will have to do if anything apart from including the css files correctly?    thanks a lot for your help in advance.
