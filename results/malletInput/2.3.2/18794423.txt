Can we use font awesome 3.2 with twitter   3?  I am primarily a java developer but in the current project I will be doing the UI part also and I am thinking of using  twitter   3.0  version. I know for icons it comes with  glyphyicons  but today I came to know about something called  font awesome 3.2  as well for icons which is considered to be better than the glyphyicons. However I noticed that font awesome 3.2 has been designed and is widely used with previous version of  twitter   2.3.2 .     Does anyone know if  twitter   3.0  will also support the  font awesome 3.2 ? If so, what will have to do if anything apart from including the css files correctly?    Thanks a lot for your help in advance.
