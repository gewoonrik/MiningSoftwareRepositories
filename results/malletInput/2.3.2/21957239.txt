attach   filestyle as append in   2  i'm trying to attach  markusslima's boostrap filestyle  as append to a fake input in   2.3.2.    there must be some kind of a conflict and no matter what i try (adding placeholder, etc,etc) nothing seems to work. i am just starting in javascript and have been stuck here since 2 weeks now.    here is my attempt:         here is my code:        div class="input-prepend input-append span12"  span  class="add-on"  i class="icon-picture icon-large"  /i  /span        input type="text" class="span9" style="margin:0;" placeholder="press the browse button to upload your photo" /              input type="file" class="filestyle" name="img_upload_file" id="img_upload_file" accept="image/*" data-classbutton="btn"  data-input="false" /             input type="hidden" name="ajax-nonce" id="ajax-nonce" value=" ?php echo wp_create_nonce('upload_img'); ? " /             input type="hidden" name="mode" id="mode" value="computer" /          input type="hidden" name="action" id="action" value="fms-upload-img" /    /div
