Bootstrap active tab doesn't move to top of screen  I have a tab system using Bootstrap 2.3.2 based on the tutorial here:    _pills_tabs/Tabs-Pills-BEGIN/tabs-pills.html     My nav list is fixed on the page and clicking each link opens the information inside its tab.    My issue is that the content in each tab is quite long and requires scrolling. If halfway down the list you click one of the other nav links it changes to the new tab but still leaves you halfway down the page. The behaviour should be to head to the start of the active tab. ie. moving the page to the top of the new active tab.              You can test it here:        I'm using   2.3.2, am loading  .min.js which include  -tab.js. The tabs work fine and activate other than not moving to the top of the tab content.
