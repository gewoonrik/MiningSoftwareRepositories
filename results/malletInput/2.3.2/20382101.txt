  buttons "loading..." when clicked  i cannot figure out how to get this feature on my buttons.        .com/2.3.2/javascript.html     if you click "buttons" it should take you to the clickable loading button.         i think my issue is that i'm not sure where to put the js to get this working. any help would be great.    thanks!
