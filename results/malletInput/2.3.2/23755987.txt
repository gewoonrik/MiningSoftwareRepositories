how to activate native   2.3.2 javascript components in liferay  i am using liferay 6.2 and including alloy ui's version of   in my html pages, i.e:      link href="  .min.css" rel="stylesheet" /   script src=" "  /script       i would like to make use of  's responsive navbar in my html like the example on the     website  but this requires the jquery collapse plugin to be included but my boss has told us we cannot include jquery and must solely use yui. i know alloy ui includes several   equivalent jquery components such as modal, tabview, accordion, etc. but i cannot get a mobile reponsive navbar working. is there a workaround to plumb this feauture in without adding jquery and   as a module within yui?
