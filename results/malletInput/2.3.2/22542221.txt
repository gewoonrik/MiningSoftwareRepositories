HTML - Setting container background & height @ 100% minimum  I have created a simple, dynamic page using Bootstrap. It has a sticky nav bar as well as a sticky footer.      I have the navbar, footer and page content to be black.    I  want  the main content area to be white   the sides of page black as per background.      I can only achieve this at the moment, by setting a physical height, not by using height:100%;    Could someone please help by looking at my existing code, to see what I am doing wrong.    I don't think I am using the 'div push' idea properly either, as I can see the white push box on the page.          Picture of desired Result  - when content is larger than page, user will scroll but footer always sticky. I believe this will already work.
