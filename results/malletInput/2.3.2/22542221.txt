html - setting container background & height @ 100% minimum  i have created a simple, dynamic page using  . it has a sticky nav bar as well as a sticky footer.      i have the navbar, footer and page content to be black.    i  want  the main content area to be white   the sides of page black as per background.      i can only achieve this at the moment, by setting a physical height, not by using height:100%;    could someone please help by looking at my existing code, to see what i am doing wrong.    i don't think i am using the 'div push' idea properly either, as i can see the white push box on the page.      div id="push"  /div        picture of desired result  - when content is larger than page, user will scroll but footer always sticky. i believe this will already work.     jsfiddle of my code        sticky footer with sticky nav code
