  css not formatting correctly  the   guide shows a horizontal form.    .com/2.3.2/base-css.html#tables  i couldn't get it to style it horizontally. i created a jsfiddle -- it also doesn't work. here's the code from the above page         i am trying to use   to format my form to have the label on the left, textbox on the right. seems simple, right?           this is what i want:        mylabel mytextbox      and not:        mylabel    mytextbox
