Bootstrap CSS not formatting correctly  The Bootstrap guide shows a horizontal form.    .com/2.3.2/base-css.html#tables  I couldn't get it to style it horizontally. I created a JSFiddle -- it also doesn't work. Here's the code from the above page         I am trying to use Bootstrap to format my form to have the label on the left, textbox on the right. Seems simple, right?           This is what I want:        MyLabel MyTextbox      and not:        MyLabel    MyTextbox
