Striped color override in   is not working for I.E. 8  I've seen several questions talk on this and make recommendations. I'm simply trying to make the alternatiing rows in Bootstrap (2.3.2) appear darker in I.E. 8. I've tried overriding the style with a notably darker background color:         Notably and predictably, the changes work in Chrome just fine.    Does anyone have any thoughts or possible work arounds here?
