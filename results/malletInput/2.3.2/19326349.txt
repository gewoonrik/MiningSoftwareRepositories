striped color override in   is not working for i.e. 8  i've seen several questions talk on this and make recommendations. i'm simply trying to make the alternatiing rows in   (2.3.2) appear darker in i.e. 8. i've tried overriding the style with a notably darker background color:     .table-striped tbody   tr:nth-child(odd)   td, .table-striped tbody   tr:nth-child(odd)   th {   background-color: #bfbaba;   }      i've cleared my i.e. 8 browser cache; closed it and re-opened, and yet nothing i change for this style seems to take effect. i've styled my table with the following:     table table-bordered table-striped      notably and predictably, the changes work in chrome just fine.    does anyone have any thoughts or possible work arounds here?
