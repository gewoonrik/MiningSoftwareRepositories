striped color override in   is not working for i.e. 8  i've seen several questions talk on this and make recommendations. i'm simply trying to make the alternatiing rows in   (2.3.2) appear darker in i.e. 8. i've tried overriding the style with a notably darker background color:         notably and predictably, the changes work in chrome just fine.    does anyone have any thoughts or possible work arounds here?
