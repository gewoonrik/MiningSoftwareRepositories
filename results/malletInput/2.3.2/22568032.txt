  2.3.2 collapse isn't auto collapsing previous panel  i'm using a   accordion feature on my website to handle a few different lists of instructions and minimize the space taken. it's working great except that it isn't collapsing the previous panel when a new one is clicked.    here's my code, is there any reason why it wouldn't auto-collapse? i have the '.in' class there on purpose, as i do want the top item open by default.      div class="accordion" id="accordion2"   div class="accordion-group"   div class="accordion-heading"   a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2" href="#collapseone"   h3 title of instructions /h3   /a   /div   div id="collapseone" class="accordion-body collapse in"   div class="accordion-inner"   ol       li some stuff /li   li some more stuff /li   /ol   /div   /div   /div   div class="accordion-group"   div class="accordion-heading"   a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2" href="#collapsetwo"   h3 another list of instructions /h3   /a   /div   div id="collapsetwo" class="accordion-body collapse"   div class="accordion-inner"  click the  ldquo;make a one-time pledge rdquo; button  ol       li some stuff /li       li some more stuff /li   /ol   /div   /div   /div   /div
