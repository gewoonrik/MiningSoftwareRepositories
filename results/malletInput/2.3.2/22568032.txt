Bootstrap 2.3.2 collapse isn't auto collapsing previous panel  I'm using a Bootstrap Accordion feature on my website to handle a few different lists of instructions and minimize the space taken. It's working great except that it isn't collapsing the previous panel when a new one is clicked.    Here's my code, is there any reason why it wouldn't auto-collapse? I have the '.in' class there on purpose, as I do want the top item open by default.
