  2.3.2 collapse isn't auto collapsing previous panel  i'm using a   accordion feature on my website to handle a few different lists of instructions and minimize the space taken. it's working great except that it isn't collapsing the previous panel when a new one is clicked.    here's my code, is there any reason why it wouldn't auto-collapse? i have the '.in' class there on purpose, as i do want the top item open by default.
