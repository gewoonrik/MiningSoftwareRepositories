  2 fixed menu issue on small devices  i have built a template based on   2.3.2 framework. on small view ports i have made the menu fixed.     the issue is when the menu is viewed in iphone5 landscape mode or crappy android portrait or crappy android landscape, only few menu are seen.     the user can't scroll down to other menus nor scroll down to see the page content unless they close the menu.    here is the test url:        if you view the test url in     you will see the problem when viewing iphone 5 landscape mode.
