Responsive CSS with Twitter Bootstrap Issue  I have a NavBar in my web-app using Ruby on Rails and Twitter Bootstrap.    The NAVBAR looks well in the browser as:      But, the Navbar breaks when I look up the web-app in the browser on my Galaxy Note.       Snippet from app/views/layouts/application.html.erb          How can I fix this? I am learning Responsive CSS these days, and have no idea how to fix it.      UPDATE:       Please note that the above problem has been fixed.  But I found something wrong when this got fixed though. If I decrease the size of window too much, the navbar gets broken. The User part goes outside the navbar.  The issue is also reflected in the Bootstrap example too .      I'm attaching the screenshots which showcase the issue. To see it yourself, simply decrease the window size in the  Bootstrap navbar example .
