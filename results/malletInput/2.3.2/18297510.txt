responsive css with     issue  i have a navbar in my web-app using ruby on rails and    .    the navbar looks well in the browser as:      but, the navbar breaks when i look up the web-app in the browser on my galaxy note.       snippet from app/views/layouts/application.html.erb          how can i fix this? i am learning responsive css these days, and have no idea how to fix it.      update:       please note that the above problem has been fixed.  but i found something wrong when this got fixed though. if i decrease the size of window too much, the navbar gets broken. the user part goes outside the navbar.  the issue is also reflected in the   example too .      i'm attaching the screenshots which showcase the issue. to see it yourself, simply decrease the window size in the    navbar example .
