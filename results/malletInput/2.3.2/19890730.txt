BOOTSTRAP (2.3.2): Deactivating a tab - events hidden and hide  so I have a scenario where I can deactivate a selected tab in nav-tabs menu.    my solution         which triggers a hide event (similarly to collapse). It works as expected... but I need also an event that is (similarly to collapse) triggered after the hide is actually done (finished animation)... so jQuery(panel).trigger("hidden");    how can I achieve this?
