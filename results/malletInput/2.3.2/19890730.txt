  (2.3.2): deactivating a tab - events hidden and hide  so i have a scenario where i can deactivate a selected tab in nav-tabs menu.    my solution         which triggers a hide event (similarly to collapse). it works as expected... but i need also an event that is (similarly to collapse) triggered after the hide is actually done (finished animation)... so jquery(panel).trigger("hidden");    how can i achieve this?
