Rows getting stretched by adjacent content  I am maintaining a web page that uses   2.3.2, and I have come across the following issue. The page is split into a sidebar and a main container, inside the main container there are fluid rows. These rows get shifted downwards by the content in the sidebar. Can anyone explain why this is happening, and/or propose a workaround? Some code is below, fiddle  here .    HTML:
