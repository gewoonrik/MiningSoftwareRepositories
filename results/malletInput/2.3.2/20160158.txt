How to prevent the backdrop of   modal dialog from covering the whole screen?  When I add a   dialog into a div with fixed positioning (position:fixed in css), and call modal('show') on this dialog, the backdrop cover the whole screen, making it impossible to interact with the dialog. When the parent div is not fixed, this problem doesn't exists.    How can I use Bootstrap Modal dialog without changing the positioning of div?    I am using Bootstrap 2.3.2 by the way.    I will post a fiddle later, if no one is aware of this particular problem.
