  typeahead ugly completion  I'm using  (2.3.2 version) typeahead completion in my rails project with simple_form but not only does it suggest the completion set but it also writes the first matched string in the field, making it ugly. what is the solution? it there any option to disable it?          UPDATE1:  by the way, to enable this completion feature, I included an external js file ( I mean it was not implemented in  ) and as it is suggested in the Q As, I used  this  css file to keep the UI beautiful.
