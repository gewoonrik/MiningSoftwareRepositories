    modal backdrop not working in ie  i've got a modal that i include via jquery such as:         works fine when i've changed the modal to appear in firefox and chrome. but in ie 8,9,10 i see not greyed out background. yet if i visit the     demo site, i can see the modal's greyed background fine. although i think this is initialized differently. can anyone point me in the right direction as to why this is happening?     boostrap v: 2.3.2    currently using  this detection script
