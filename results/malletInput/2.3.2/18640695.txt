Twitter   modal backdrop not working in IE  I've got a modal that i include via jQuery such as:         Works fine when I've changed the modal to appear in Firefox and chrome. But in IE 8,9,10 i see not greyed out background. Yet if i visit the twitter   demo site, i can see the modal's greyed background fine. Although i think this is initialized differently. Can anyone point me in the right direction as to why this is happening?     Boostrap v: 2.3.2    Currently using  this detection script
