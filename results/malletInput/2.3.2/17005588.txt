   : getting form inputs and buttons to be same the height in chrome and firefox  using      2.3.2  i have a  input-append  form:      form class="bs-docs-example"     div class="input-append"       input type="text" id="form-input" class="span2"       button type="button" class="btn" id="form-btn" go! /button     /div   /form       i customized the form input and button to have this styling:     #form-input {   height: 50px;   font-size: 16px;   padding: 0px 6px; }  #form-btn {   height: 50px;   font-size: 16px; }      the input field and button in firefox is exactly aligned but the button in chrome is off my 2px in height so i have to put it to  52px . this cannot be done since it messes up the firefox form. how can i get them to have the same alignment in both browsers?
