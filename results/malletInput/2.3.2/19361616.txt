Bootstrap fixed size right column  I'm using   v. 2.3.2 (ie7 reason), and would like to make a grid with one fixed column size (300px). I can do this when that col is first and in left column but I need it in the right side of page. I also found on stack some working examples, but in this examples the fixed column is first in page code and then floated to the right. Is it possible to make layoud where      When page will be displayed on smart-phone, that column will be hidden.    Thanks for any help.
