  fixed size right column  i'm using   v. 2.3.2 (ie7 reason), and would like to make a grid with one fixed column size (300px). i can do this when that col is first and in left column but i need it in the right side of page. i also found on stack some working examples, but in this examples the fixed column is first in page code and then floated to the right. is it possible to make layoud where  span300px  will be the "last" and fixed size element (semantic reason)?    my code is very simple:      div class="container"     div class="row-fluid"           div class="span8"            ....          /div           div class="span300px"            ....          /div     /div   /div       when page will be displayed on smart-phone, that column will be hidden.    thanks for any help.
