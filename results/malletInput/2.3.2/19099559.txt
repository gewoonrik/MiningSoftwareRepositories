Create a 100% width Bootstrap navbar with pulldown menus  I want to create a 100% justified width menu with a dropdown menu. It's exactly the menu on the Twitter Bootstrap example (   .com/2.3.2/examples/justified-nav.html ) but then also with dropdown menus.     The problem is that there is no relative position on the li-element when turning it into  -element which the dropdown-menu triggers. Does somebody has a solution for this?
