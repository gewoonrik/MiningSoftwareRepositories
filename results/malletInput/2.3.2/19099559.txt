create a 100% width   navbar with pulldown menus  i want to create a 100% justified width menu with a dropdown menu. it's exactly the menu on the     example (   .com/2.3.2/examples/justified-nav.html ) but then also with dropdown menus.     the problem is that there is no relative position on the li-element when turning it into  -element which the dropdown-menu triggers. does somebody has a solution for this?
