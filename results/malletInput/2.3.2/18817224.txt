making devise alerts dismissible - syntax error  i am trying to have my devise alerts be dismissible.  data-dismiss="alert" is what i believe is required, per the   documentation:    .com/2.3.2/components.html#alerts     however, i try to add this into my application layout per the below, and i receive a syntax error:      % flash.each do |key, value| %           %= content_tag(:div, value, class: "alert alert-#{key}", data-dismiss: "alert") %   % end %       without the data-dismiss the code works fine, but is not dismissable.     here is the syntax error:     ...rt alert-#{key}", data-dismiss: "alert") );@output_buffer.sa... ...                               ^       the point of data-dismiss: "alert" is to have it closable with an x as per   buttons.  this involves including an "x" button, how do i fix the syntax error and include the "x"?
