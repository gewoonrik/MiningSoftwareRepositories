Making devise alerts dismissible - syntax error  I am trying to have my devise alerts be dismissible.  data-dismiss="alert" is what I believe is required, per the   documentation:    .com/2.3.2/components.html#alerts     However, I try to add this into my application layout per the below, and I receive a syntax error:         The point of data-dismiss: "alert" is to have it closable with an X as per   buttons.  This involves including an "X" button, how do I fix the syntax error and include the "X"?
