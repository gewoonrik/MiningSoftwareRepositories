Issues with opening multiple modal dialogs  I have custom code (kind of library) for opening modal dialogs    It looks like below;         Also I am using Bootstrap 2.3.2 for the modal dialogs.    My question is while my custom code works fine for single open modal dialogs, it is creating issues when I am trying to open 2 simultaneous modal dialogs (i.e. opening a child modal from within the parent modal)    The issues are mainly to do with backdrop on the UI; I mean my child modal is slightly smaller and I can access the parent modal when I have the child modal open (I should not be able to access the parent modal when the child dialog is opened)    Please suggest how I can fix in the above code to handle for multiple open modal dialogs.
