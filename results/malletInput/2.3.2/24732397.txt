issues with opening multiple modal dialogs  i have custom code (kind of library) for opening modal dialogs    it looks like below;         also i am using   2.3.2 for the modal dialogs.    my question is while my custom code works fine for single open modal dialogs, it is creating issues when i am trying to open 2 simultaneous modal dialogs (i.e. opening a child modal from within the parent modal)    the issues are mainly to do with backdrop on the ui; i mean my child modal is slightly smaller and i can access the parent modal when i have the child modal open (i should not be able to access the parent modal when the child dialog is opened)    please suggest how i can fix in the above code to handle for multiple open modal dialogs.
