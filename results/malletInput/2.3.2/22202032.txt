  2.3.2 responsive layout doesn't work on ie8  i'll try to be more specific. i have this stylesheets on my main control        link href="/css/fonts.css" rel="stylesheet" /           link href="/css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet" /           link href="/css/ -responsive.min.css" rel="stylesheet" /           link href="/css/mysite.css" rel="stylesheet" /           link href="/css/responsive.css" rel="stylesheet" /           !--[if ie]           link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/explorer.css" /           ![endif]--        !-- css3-mediaqueries.js for ie less than 9 --           !--[if lt ie 9]   script src="js/css3-mediaqueries.js"  /script   ![endif]--       my container width for large screen comes from responsive.css where i have this code      @media handheld, only screen and (min-width: 1440px){       {.container:1400px;}    }      when i run my code in crome it is 1400px for large screen ignoring   container width this       @media (min-width: 1200px){ .container { width: 1170px;} }      and this     .container{ width: 940px; }      but when i run my code in ie8 it picks up   container width      .container{ width: 940px; }      and ignors      @media handheld, only screen and (min-width: 1440px){ {.container:1400px;}  }      the problem is i want explorer 8 not to ignore my code for large sreen(1400px). i know i cannot add it in my  "explorer.css" as a media query inside a media query like this. i know it won't work.     /* ie8 */ @media \0screen { @media handheld, only screen and (min-width: 1440px){ .container:1400px;}  }      so  i decided to add !important on this     @media handheld, only screen and (min-width: 1440px){ {.container:1400px !important;} }      so it began to be of the size i want for the large screen but now it resizes very slowly(due to css3-mediaqueries.js which works slowly) and is not showing up mobile design .so now my question is whether  css3-mediaqueries.js supports mobile? thanks for trying to help.
