  2.3.2 responsive layout doesn't work on ie8  i'll try to be more specific. i have this stylesheets on my main control          so it began to be of the size i want for the large screen but now it resizes very slowly(due to css3-mediaqueries.js which works slowly) and is not showing up mobile design .so now my question is whether  css3-mediaqueries.js supports mobile? thanks for trying to help.
