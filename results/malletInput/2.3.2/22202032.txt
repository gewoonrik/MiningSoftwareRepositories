Bootstrap 2.3.2 responsive layout doesn't work on IE8  I'll try to be more specific. I have this stylesheets on my main control          so it began to be of the size I want for the large screen but now it resizes very slowly(due to css3-mediaqueries.js which works slowly) and is not showing up mobile design .So now my question is whether  css3-mediaqueries.js supports mobile? Thanks for trying to help.
