Bootstrap and smoothscrolling javascript not playing nicely together  I have a site that uses Bootstrap 2 and a smooth scrolling javascript.    Bootstrap         (   )    Problem is, when I started using the smooth scrolling, the javascript tabs stopped working.    I think the problem is because the smoothscrolling affects the tabbed content links, but am not sure how to fix it.    I'd like to fix this is possible - but will resort to using a different script for either if necessary.    Thanks in advance.
