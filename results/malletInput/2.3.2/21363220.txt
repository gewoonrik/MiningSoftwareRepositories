  and smoothscrolling javascript not playing nicely together  i have a site that uses   2 and a smooth scrolling javascript.              (   )    problem is, when i started using the smooth scrolling, the javascript tabs stopped working.    i think the problem is because the smoothscrolling affects the tabbed content links, but am not sure how to fix it.    i'd like to fix this is possible - but will resort to using a different script for either if necessary.    thanks in advance.
