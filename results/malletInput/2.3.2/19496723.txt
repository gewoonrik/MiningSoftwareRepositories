reliably hide   modal  i'm using     2.3.2, and i'm using modal dialogs like this:      div id="notice1" class="modal hide fade"       div class="modal-body"           h4 this is a dialog for user... /h4       /div      ...  /div       and     var notice1 = $("#notice1"); notice1.modal({     keyboard: false,     backdrop: "static",     show: false });  // show the dialog notice1.modal("show");  // close the dialog notice1.modal("hide");      most of the the time, the above works fine and the modal dialog are opened and closed programmatically. however, in some rare cases, calling  .modal("hide")  does not close the dialog at all though the dark backdrop is removed.    this is a huge potential issue because the dialog may get stuck on the screen and block part of the content.    is there a reliable way to ensure the dialog is always closed after calling  .modal("hide") ? or better yet, how do we ensure a consistent  hide  behavior from    ? i don't want to remove the dialog completely from the dom, because the same dialog may be re-used on the page.
