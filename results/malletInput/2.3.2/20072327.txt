Duplicated FontAwesome Icons on Bootstrap Navbar  I'm currently working on my navbar and I'm stuck with this :           As you can see there is a duplicated icons for each ...    I'm using Bootstrap 2.3.2 and FontAwesome 4.0.3         I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Any clue ?    Thanks.    In fact, thanks to Jon Kartago Lamida, the problem seem to be coming from the   i > element and replacing it by the   span > element solve it.
