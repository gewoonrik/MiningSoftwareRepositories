custom grid with less for   2  i'm working on a joomla site that will have a container width of 940px (can be up to 1000px, but not wider). joomla 3, regretfully, sticks to   2. the online customizer  for bs 2.3.2 is long gone. what i used to do is tick everything except large screen, and work with that version. the default  , minus the large screen settings.     now i have to do the same thing in less, and i haven't done that. who can give me some tips?    changing the responsive-1200px-min.less from @media (min-width: 1200px) to @media (min-width: 940px), then crunch the  .less into  .css and replace  .css in the css folder doesn't work.     i know i doing this completely wrong, hence my question.
