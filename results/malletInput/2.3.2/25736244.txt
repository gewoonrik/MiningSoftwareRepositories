Custom grid with Less for Bootstrap 2  I'm working on a Joomla site that will have a container width of 940px (can be up to 1000px, but not wider). Joomla 3, regretfully, sticks to Bootstrap 2. The online customizer  for BS 2.3.2 is long gone. What I used to do is tick everything except large screen, and work with that version. The default Bootstrap, minus the Large Screen settings.     Now I have to do the same thing in Less, and I haven't done that. Who can give me some tips?    Changing the responsive-1200px-min.less from @media (min-width: 1200px) to @media (min-width: 940px), then crunch the  .less into  .css and replace  .css in the CSS folder doesn't work.     I know I doing this completely wrong, hence my question.
