scrollbar in   2.3.2 tabs/nav bar  i am using   2.3.2    on one of the pages, i have tabs (vertical orientation), which i generate dynamically based on data.  in a small % of cases, this list of tabs grows to 15-20 tabs and the page doesnt look visually appealing.    i want that after specific number of tabs, a pagination like previous/next button appears to scroll the tabs.    any help/ideas on how to build, or links to existing resources will be highly appreciated.    thanks avinash
