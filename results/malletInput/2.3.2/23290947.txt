Scrollbar in   2.3.2 tabs/nav bar  I am using Bootstrap 2.3.2    On one of the pages, I have Tabs (Vertical orientation), which I generate dynamically based on data.  In a small % of cases, this list of tabs grows to 15-20 tabs and the page doesnt look visually appealing.    I want that after specific number of tabs, a pagination like Previous/Next button appears to scroll the tabs.    Any help/ideas on how to build, or links to existing resources will be highly appreciated.    Thanks Avinash
