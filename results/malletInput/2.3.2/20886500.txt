sticky footer in   2.3.2 causing huge gap and scroll  i have implemented this  sticky footer  for   2.3.2 on my site but am running into an issue on a page that has short content  here .  there is too much space between the content and the footer, as well as an inconvenient scrollbar.  is there a way to prevent the huge gap in space and the scroll bar on a short page with short content?    i am using this code to generate the sticky footer.
