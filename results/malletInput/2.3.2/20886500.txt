sticky footer in   2.3.2 causing huge gap and scroll  i have implemented this  sticky footer  for   2.3.2 on my site but am running into an issue on a page that has short content  here .  there is too much space between the content and the footer, as well as an inconvenient scrollbar.  is there a way to prevent the huge gap in space and the scroll bar on a short page with short content?    i am using this code to generate the sticky footer.       html, body {       height: 100%;       margin: 0;       padding: 0; }  #wrap{     min-height: 100%;     height: auto !important;     height: 100%;     margin: 0 auto -150px; }  #push{     height: 150px; }  #footer{    background-color: #3bc1cd;    height: 150px; }
