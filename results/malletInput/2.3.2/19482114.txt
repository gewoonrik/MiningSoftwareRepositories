Bootstrap Sidebar Scrolling, Affix & Scrollspy   NEWER     So the scrolling is working now... But it's fixed to the top of the page. I need it to be in the correct position (next to the content) and then start scrolling with at it's current position with the content.    I'm trying to get my sidebar to scroll like this one here ->    .com/2.3.2/components.html     The website is     (a free hosted site for now)        OLDER     I'm having a really hard time with this. I've looked up everything I could and I still can't figure it out. I got it to work for a while with a tutorial I found, but it didn't work well with ScrollSpy. So I'm trying to use Bootstrap's Affix.     I'm new to javascript / jquery so if anyone could look over my website and check to see what I'm doing wrong.    The ScrollSpy is working right now I think, I just can't get the sidebar to scroll with the page.
