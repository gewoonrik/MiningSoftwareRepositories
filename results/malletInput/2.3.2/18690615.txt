testing     on django badges  i currently have     incorporated on my django test site but it is not working properly.     i tested out an example of code on the   website:    .com/2.3.2/components.html#labels-badges     all i had on the site is the success badge (green oval with a 2 in the middle)          span class="badge badge-success" 2 /span       however, only the oval and the "2" would be displayed but the green color round the "2" is not  displayed. all i see is a grey oval with a "2" inside. pretty much the same as the default badge on the   website except there is a "2" instead of a "1".    i was wondering if anyone with django and     experience would help me with this issue.    here is my views.py:         from django.http import httpresponse     from django.template import requestcontext, loader     from django.shortcuts import render, render_to_response      def index(request):         return render(request,'homepage/index.html')      here is my html file:         {% load staticfiles %}     {% load compressed %}       !doctype html        head      {% compressed_js ' ' %}     {% compressed_css ' ' %}      /head        html       body        span class="badge badge-success" 2 /span        /body       /html       thank you for all the help! much appreciated!
