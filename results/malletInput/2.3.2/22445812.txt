Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 popover 'manual' trigger not behaving as intended  So here I am stuck with   issue again, problem arises when I go for manual trigger of popovers in a unordered list. I want it to show on hover and stay without fading away until user hovers over another item.    Relevent Java Script :         Screen shot for #sidemenu as it appears     Screenshot of sidemenu      So the problem here is that the popover only chooses to appear at some random times of mouseover, sometimes it does and sometimes it dosent o_O. Any way i can fix this or can someone put me in the right track.
