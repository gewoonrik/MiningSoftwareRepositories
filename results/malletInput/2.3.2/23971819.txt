close one div when the other opens -    i'm using the   native collapse functionality  : collapse.js v3.0.2 to open div's when a button is pressed. it works great but i would like one div to close when the other opens. currently, as   designed it, a single button controls the toggling for the specific div. it is good if i wanted to have one button control one section, but i was wondering if there is a way to make a any button in my list of buttons, close any open div before opening its respective div.    i have reviewed this code  *  : collapse.js v3.0.2 * in the  .js filebut can't figure our how to do what i want.    can someone point me in the right direction to help me determine what i need to do to get the functionality i'm looking for.     this is the url to the page i'm developing where you can see the buttons working:       i don't know if i need to add more code to the file or if i can just call   data attributes to accomplish this.    i have studied this page:    .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#collapse     thank you, mike
