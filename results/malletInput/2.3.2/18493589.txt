In CSS, how to scale multiple overlayed images responsively?  I have multiple images overlayed on top of a background, here's an example:      but the overlay images are appearing in the wrong spots.    How would I refactor this to allow all images within a div tag to scale properly relative to each other? BTW, I am using Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 as the default CSS theme.    More info. All images are of fixed size, e.g. the background is 640x480, shown at position 0, 0. The overlay images are also fixed size and need to go into certain positions in relation to the background image. e.g. an overlay maybe 64x64 and goes to position 15, 24 (top, left), another maybe 128x128 and goes into position 200, 231, etc. With these precise position overlaying, the background + the overlays becomes a complete picture.
