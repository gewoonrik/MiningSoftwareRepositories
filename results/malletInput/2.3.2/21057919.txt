    collapsing menu not in front of other elements  i'm using     2.3 and when i make my browser smaller it collapses correctly but when i click on the button to do the dropdown it doesn't appear in front of the other items.  here is a working demo:      i've been trying to fix it in the developer tools in chrome but to no avail.    here is the relevant code:         in the official  demo site  it pushes down all the other elements which i would be happy with or if i can simply make it so that it is in front of the other elements.
