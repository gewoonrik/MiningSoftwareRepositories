  responsive menu expanding in response to button click on another menu  i have a moodle (version 2.6.2) page with two responsive   menus: one for the top menu, located above the logo, and one for the course menu, located below the logo. each menu has its own expand/collapse icon.     the expected behavior is that when you click a menu's icon, that menu, and only that menu will expand. what happens currently is that, when you click the menu icon for the menu located below the logo, both menus expand. if you click the icon for the top menu, only the top menu will expand, and after that, the clicking the menu icon for the bottom menu will only expand and contract that menu.    below is the code generated by moodle. the theme is using collapse_2.3.2.js.             how do i make my menus behave as expected?    thank you, rebecca
