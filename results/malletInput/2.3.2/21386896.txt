how to horizontally centre form in span with   2.3.2?  i have the following code...         ...but the search form doesn't align with the h2 tag. do i need to have the form custom styled via css or am i missing out on some default   class to fix this?    thanks so much for taking time to read/answer this query.    [edit]           added jsfiddle
