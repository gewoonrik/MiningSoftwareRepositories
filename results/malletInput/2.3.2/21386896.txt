how to horizontally centre form in span with   2.3.2?  i have the following code...      div class="row"     div class="span6"       h2 some text /h2     /div     div class="span6"       form class="form-inline pull-right"         input type="text" class="input-large"         button type="submit" class="btn" search /button       /form     /div   /div       ...but the search form doesn't align with the h2 tag. do i need to have the form custom styled via css or am i missing out on some default   class to fix this?    thanks so much for taking time to read/answer this query.    [edit]           added jsfiddle
