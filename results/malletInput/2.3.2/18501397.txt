how to put back the hover effect on  3's buttons?  the devs said   3 would come bundled with an optional theme to make it look like   2.    the problem is they seem to have forgotten to put the hover effects on the buttons. is there a way to put that back?    this is how it looks on v2, just move the mouse over any button and see the effect:       .com/2.3.2/examples/hero.html     and this is how it looks now in v3 (no effect):       .com/examples/theme/
