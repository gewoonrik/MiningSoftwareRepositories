action of command button not invoked if i use ajax  i have the following problem:    i have a button that should invoke a method, but the page should't get refreshed (i display a  dialog based on   modal  after clicking on the button and it vanishes otherwise). therefore i use ajax to say that nothing should get rendered after clicking on the button.     i already used applied it before and it worked. but in the recent version of my code the method isn't invoked anymore as long as i use ajax. if i remove the ajax part the method is invoked as it should be, but the page gets refreshed and i don't want that.     my code:       h:form       ui:fragment rendered="#{bean.condition1}"           ui:include src="facelet1.xhtml" /       /ui:fragment       ui:fragment rendered="#{bean.condition2}"           ui:include src="facelet2.xhtml" /       /ui:fragment        h:commandbutton value="save" action="bean.method"           f:ajax execute="@form" render="@none"/       /h:commandbutton         h:form        before  i had it like this and it worked:      h:form       ui:include src="bean.faceletpath" /        h:commandbutton value="save" action="bean.method"           f:ajax execute="@form" render="@none"/       /h:commandbutton         h:form       thanks all,    /metalhamster       edit:     facelet1.xhtml:      html xmlns=" "     xmlns:ui=" " xmlns:h=" " xmlns:f=" "   h:body    ui:composition       h:panelgrid columns="2"           h:outputtext value="name:"           h:inputtext value="bean.name"           h:outputtext value="value:"           h:inputtext value="bean.value"       /h:panelgrid   /ui:composition    /h:body   /html       facelet2.xhtml:      html xmlns=" "     xmlns:ui=" " xmlns:h=" " xmlns:f=" "   h:body    ui:composition       h:panelgrid columns="2"           h:outputtext value="name:"           h:inputtext value="bean.name"           h:outputtext value="text:"           h:inputtext value="bean.text"       /h:panelgrid   /ui:composition    /h:body   /html
