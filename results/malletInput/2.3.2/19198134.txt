How to create link to particular description element within collapsible section?  I have  description items  inside of  collapsible elements  like below:         So, content of both sections is hidden by default. How can I support direct links to:      section 2 (so, the content of the section should be shown);   element 2-2 (so, the content of the section 2 should be shown and element 2-2 should be focused)?
