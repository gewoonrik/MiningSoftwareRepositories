Bootstrap Modal blocks select element  When the Modal appears there is a select list that is anchored to the top left of the page. Eventually that list will be used to provide navigation options; however I am unable to select an option in the list.  I have tried to set the z-index higher than the modal but nothing seems to work.  Hope someone can shed some light on a solution? Thanks!
