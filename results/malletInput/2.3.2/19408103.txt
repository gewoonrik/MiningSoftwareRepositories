  modal blocks select element  when the modal appears there is a select list that is anchored to the top left of the page. eventually that list will be used to provide navigation options; however i am unable to select an option in the list.  i have tried to set the z-index higher than the modal but nothing seems to work.  hope someone can shed some light on a solution? thanks!
