    typeahead change dropdown menu width based on query  i'm not really sure if this is jquery-related, but i have a strong suspicion. my issue is detailed in this picture:         the query result is longer than the width and it doesn't scale/resize. i tried to change  -typeahead.js with        _resizemenu : function() {         var ul = this.$menu;         ul.css("min-width", this.$element.outerwidth());     }      but no go...  i would like to keep the size of the search box, but i don't want to change the font as it would make everything else too small. i want the dropdown box to extend according to size of query. i am using     2.3.2 by the way. has anyone else solved this problem?
