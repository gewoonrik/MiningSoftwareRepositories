twitter   typeahead change dropdown menu width based on query  I'm not really sure if this is jQuery-related, but I have a strong suspicion. My issue is detailed in this picture:         The query result is longer than the width and it doesn't scale/resize. I tried to change  -typeahead.js with          but no go...  I would like to keep the size of the search box, but I don't want to change the font as it would make everything else too small. I want the dropdown box to extend according to size of query. I am using Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 by the way. Has anyone else solved this problem?
