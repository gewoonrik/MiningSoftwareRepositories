jquery problems with   3 and kendoui  i'm experiencing a little issue with these two frameworks and their respective use of jquery. as my template in visual studio 2013 includes   3 it also comes bundled with  jquery-2.0.3.js  this is all fine until i need to use kendoui's  jquery.js  (v1.9.1) as well.     they're both included in the  _layout.cshtml  like this:     ...  head       script src="@url.content("~/scripts/kendo/jquery.min.js")"  /script       script src="@url.content("~/scripts/kendo/kendo.all.min.js")"  /script       script src="@url.content("~/scripts/kendo/kendo.aspnetmvc.min.js")"  /script '  /head   body  ...     @scripts.render("~/bundles/jquery")     @scripts.render("~/bundles/ ")     @rendersection("scripts", required: false)  /body       the error causes my kendo grid not to render templates and the console window in chrome shows the following error:      i've had this working before, when on   2.3.2, but the entire project is updated. what effect would loosing the  jquery-2.0.3.js  have on my application? removing this resolves the problem, but i don't know what parts of the   framework will be affected by this. finally, i know i'm not supposed to include the jquery-files twice (  + kendoui), but how should it be done?
