Jquery problems with Bootstrap 3 and KendoUI  I'm experiencing a little issue with these two frameworks and their respective use of jquery. As my template in Visual studio 2013 includes Bootstrap 3 it also comes bundled with   have on my application? Removing this resolves the problem, but I don't know what parts of the Bootstrap framework will be affected by this. Finally, I know I'm not supposed to include the jquery-files twice (Bootstrap + KendoUI), but how should it be done?
