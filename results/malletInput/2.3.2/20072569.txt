jquery problems with   3 and kendoui  i'm experiencing a little issue with these two frameworks and their respective use of jquery. as my template in visual studio 2013 includes   3 it also comes bundled with   have on my application? removing this resolves the problem, but i don't know what parts of the   framework will be affected by this. finally, i know i'm not supposed to include the jquery-files twice (  + kendoui), but how should it be done?
