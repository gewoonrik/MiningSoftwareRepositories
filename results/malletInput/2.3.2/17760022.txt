What is the minimum code to make ScrollSpy   sidebar like the example?  I have seen the left hand ScrollSpy example on the   page:       /2.3.2/javascript.html#scrollspy     But they don't have any example code of how to get the same style and effect? What is the minimum code needed to achieve this, as all the JsFiddle examples I have seen do not have the styling.    Update    I have stopped using scrollspy on my projects as the scrollbar only works at the page level, and I need the scrollbar to only appear on the container where the scrolling takes place
