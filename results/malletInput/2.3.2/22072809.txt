how to override a javascript function in      we currently use     2.3.2 and i am trying to figure out a way to tie into the toggle function that is part of the dropdown component.  i am trying to do this globally and have come up with this code:     ; (function ($, window, document, undefined) {     var oldtoggle = $.fn.dropdown.constructor.prototype.toggle;      $.fn.dropdown.constructor.prototype.toggle = function (e)         {             console.log('here');             return oldtoggle.call(this, e);         } })(jquery, window, document);      when i put this code in the   file, the override works fine.  when i try to include it elsewhere on the page my console.log never executes.  what am i missing here?    here is a link to a jsfiddle that includes the code posted above
