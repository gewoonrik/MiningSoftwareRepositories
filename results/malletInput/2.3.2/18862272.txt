Twitter Bootstrap LESS compilation missing styles  So I have looked at the  navbar  component of tb and it has  navbar-inner  class However when I download  version 3  of tb from git hub and manually compile LESS folder those styles are not available in fact lots of styles not available is there is something that I'm missing?    When I compile LESS I compile main file (which is  .less) that has all the imports.    Would be interesting to know what I'm missing. Any ideas appreciated.
