    less compilation missing styles  so i have looked at the  navbar  component of tb and it has  navbar-inner  class however when i download  version 3  of tb from git hub and manually compile less folder those styles are not available in fact lots of styles not available is there is something that i'm missing?    when i compile less i compile main file (which is  .less) that has all the imports.    would be interesting to know what i'm missing. any ideas appreciated.
