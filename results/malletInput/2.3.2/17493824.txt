  mobile dropdown menu links not clickable  i am using the latest version of     ( 2.3.2 ) as the framework for my site.    the only issue i have run into with  s navmenu is that when viewing the site on my phone, the dropdown links are not clickable. when you try to click the link the menu closes. links outside of the dropdown work just fine though. i checked in my  -dropdown.js and looked for a recommended line of code i found on a github discussion that is supposed to fix the issue but it was already there. what's the fix for this? i appreciate any help with this matter.
