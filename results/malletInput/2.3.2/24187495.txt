regular   versus  /theme in  -sass 3.1.1 gem rails  i am a little confused as to versions of   and how to enable them in rails.     after installing  -sass gem (3.1.1) and writing  @import " "  into my  application.css.scss  folder, the styles on my views seem to default to   version 2.3.2, using classes like "hero-unit" instead of "jumbotron" (jumbotron only available in the latest   3.1.1). why does that happen?     why do i have to  @import " /theme  to make "jumbotron" work when in fact, "jumbotron" seems to be just part of 3.1.1, as shown by    .com/components/  ?     or am i just confused? is "hero-unit" a part of every regular   file and "jumbotron" only comes when you enable " /theme"?
