Regular Bootstrap versus Bootstrap/theme in Bootstrap-sass 3.1.1 gem rails  I am a little confused as to versions of Bootstrap and how to enable them in Rails.     After installing  -sass gem (3.1.1) and writing   to make "jumbotron" work when in fact, "jumbotron" seems to be just part of 3.1.1, as shown by    .com/components/  ?     Or am I just confused? Is "hero-unit" a part of every regular   file and "jumbotron" only comes when you enable " /theme"?
