regular   versus  /theme in  -sass 3.1.1 gem rails  i am a little confused as to versions of   and how to enable them in rails.     after installing  -sass gem (3.1.1) and writing   to make "jumbotron" work when in fact, "jumbotron" seems to be just part of 3.1.1, as shown by    .com/components/  ?     or am i just confused? is "hero-unit" a part of every regular   file and "jumbotron" only comes when you enable " /theme"?
