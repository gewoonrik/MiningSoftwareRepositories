How to make   dropdown be shown over a modal-footer instead of making modal overflow?  I have created a modal to allow users to add alarms, one alarm can have many notifications of different kinds, so I want the user to choose which kind of notification he wants via a dropdown.    You can see a (not 100% working) fiddle here:        I am using Bootstrap version   property without success.     Can someone help me?     EDIT  Opening the dropdown upwards (dropup) to the upside is also not an option since the problem occurs (when the screen is resized to desktop size);
