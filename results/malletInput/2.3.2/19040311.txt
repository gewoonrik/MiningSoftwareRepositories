    without phonegap for android/ios  my goal is to write an application for android and ios that:       uses the flat ui style   still has functionality in it's buttons (i.e. buttons execute functions such as storing data)   may be used while the phone isn't connected to the internet.      the way i currently see it, there are two ways this can 90% achieved. the first is that you can create a webpage, access it through a webview/uiwebview, and use javascript to execute android/ios functions with button clicks. the only problem with this method is that the phone needs to access the webpage through the internet.    the other method is to write a webpage and have it integrated into an .apk or .ipa file through the use of  phonegap . the problem with this method is i'm unable to add in the android/ios part of the code where the functions are created. i simply have control over the webpage/ui part of the application.    so my question stems from this - is there a way to perform what phonegap does but do it so that i can still have access to say, my src folder for android. i have written a webpage using       with an added ui kit,  flat ui free . i was able to successfully convert it into an .apk file and have it run on my android as expected - so i know it is possible to take the html/css/js/less files and incorporate them into the final .apk file - i'm just unsure how to set this up in eclipse/intellij etc.    thanks.
