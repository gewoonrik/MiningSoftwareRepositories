  modal changes size after hide/reopen  i'm having a very frustrating issue with a   modal (  2.3.2) that i'm using for a file upload window. it is probably important to note that this is a nested modal, but this is the only instance that i'm having this automatic re-size issue. i have 6 other secondary modals that open from the primary product editor modal that are not resizing after they open/close.     its also worth noting, that on the other modals that are not having this resize issue, they are not being assigned a custom width value.    here are two images, the first is the first time i open the modal, the second is after it calls modal('hide') and then is opened again with modal('show');        (first open)     (second open)    this is the creation code:         this should make sure the primary modal windows width stays at the original definition of 60%. however, it makes no difference. the first time the modal is open, it represents 60% of the screen in width. any subsequent openings, it has shrunk down in size. it doesn't continue to shrink after the first hide, but neither can i get it to retain the original desired width.     one last note - it is only changing the width, probably because this is a percentage value.    thanks for any help! i'm really not that good at css so i'm guessing you css wizards will know whats happening almost immediately! if i haven't provided enough information please just leave a message and i'll add to this post.    (note: upgrading to bs 3 is just not an option, the code base would take weeks to clean up)
