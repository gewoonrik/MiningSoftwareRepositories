Bootstrap Modal Changes Size After Hide/Reopen  I'm having a very frustrating issue with a Bootstrap Modal (Bootstrap 2.3.2) that I'm using for a file upload window. It is probably important to note that this is a nested modal, but this is the only instance that I'm having this automatic re-size issue. I have 6 other secondary modals that open from the primary Product Editor modal that are not resizing after they open/close.     Its also worth noting, that on the other modals that are not having this resize issue, they are not being assigned a custom width value.    Here are two images, the first is the first time I open the modal, the second is after it calls modal('hide') and then is opened again with modal('show');        (first open)     (second open)    This is the creation code:         This should make sure the primary modal windows width stays at the original definition of 60%. However, it makes no difference. The first time the modal is open, it represents 60% of the screen in width. Any subsequent openings, it has shrunk down in size. It doesn't continue to shrink after the first hide, but neither can I get it to retain the original desired width.     One last note - it is only changing the width, probably because this is a percentage value.    Thanks for any help! I'm really not that good at CSS so I'm guessing you CSS wizards will know whats happening almost immediately! If I haven't provided enough information please just leave a message and I'll add to this post.    (Note: Upgrading to BS 3 is just not an option, the code base would take weeks to clean up)
