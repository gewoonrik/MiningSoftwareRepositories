    - how to handle form-horizontal with multiple inputs on the same line and multiple screen sizes?  i'm developing an application that has at least 30+ input fields.  i would like to use  form-horizontal  and have my labels to the left of my input fields.  i run into an issue when i have multiple label/textboxes on the same line.  for example, i'm trying to fit city (and its textbox), state (and its dropdown), and zip code (and its textbox).  it looks fine on a widescreen, but labels begin to overlap other inputs when the screen is reduced to non-widescreen (and worse when at tablet screen size).      how can i avoid this?  should each label/input combination be its own  span4  within the same row-fluid?  should i be trying to fit all within a single div of  span12 ?    i've tried to find examples, but every one that i've found doesn't use form-horizontal and isn't very complex.  i'm using   2.3.2.    code:      div class="row-fluid"       div class="span4"          @html.labelfor(m =  m.primarycompanyaddress.city, new {@class = "control-label", @for = "primarycompanyaddress_city"})          div class="controls"              @html.textboxfor(m =  m.primarycompanyaddress.city)          /div       /div       div class="span4"          @html.labelfor(m =  m.primarycompanyaddress.state, new {@class = "control-label"})          div class="controls"              @html.statedropdownlistfor(m =  m.primarycompanyaddress.state, new {@class = "input-medium"})          /div       /div       div class="span4"          @html.labelfor(m =  m.primarycompanyaddress.zip, new {@class = "control-label"})          div class="controls"              @html.textboxfor(m =  m.primarycompanyaddress.zip, new {@class = "input-mini"})          /div       /div   /div
