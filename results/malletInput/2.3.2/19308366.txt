  checkbox input align vertically  using   version 2.3.2, i have a form layout like the below image and since the checkbox has an inline label, there is an aligning issue.         adding margin to  input[type="checkbox"]  only gives margin to the checkbox, not the inline label. how do i make it so the checkbox and its label vertically align to the text fields next to it?    here is the   js bin  if you are interested.
