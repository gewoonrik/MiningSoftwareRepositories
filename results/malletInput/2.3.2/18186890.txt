why collapsed by accident after setinterval ajax call load  i have problem with all element with collapsed-out after ajax-call-load in setinterval executed immediately all collapsed-out became collapsed-in automatically. it should be kept collapsed-out if not command to collapse-in    any idea ?    note: i've been test by disabling ajax-call-load in setinterval and all collapsed-out not become collapsed-in.   2.3.2
