Why Collapsed by accident after setInterval ajax call load  I have problem with all element with collapsed-out after ajax-call-load in setInterval executed immediately all collapsed-out became collapsed-in automatically. It should be kept collapsed-out if not command to collapse-in    Any idea ?    Note: I've been test by disabling ajax-call-load in setInterval and all collapsed-out not become collapsed-in.
