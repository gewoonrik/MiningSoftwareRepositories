User resizeable columns in   2.3.2  I have a layout that looks a lot like this:                I want to make the two centre border lines be resizeable by the user. I'm looking to have them snap into place, for instance if you dragged the right column larger it would change the middle column from span7->span6 and the right column from span2->span3.    I'm not sure where to start. I know the code has to remove and add classes, and I could do it with a button in a minute but I don't know how to manipulate the 'click-and-drag'.
