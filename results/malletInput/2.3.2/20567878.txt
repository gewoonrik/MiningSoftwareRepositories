  typeahead not desplaying all results  using: jquery 2.0.3,          2.3.2 (both as requested by my our client)    my typeahead code:      (the order of the results is not always the same, but i  always  get these 4 results, which is correct according to the client)    my problem is this: the autocomplete box never shows more than 3 results. i have logged the results in the console, and even though the ajax results returns all 4, only 3 are displayed.    it also stops giving autocomplete suggestions for any string more than 3 characters, even though i know the ajax is receiving results(e.g it won't display any results for istanbul, even though it gets 3 back from the server)    can anyone please help me locate where i have made a mistake?
