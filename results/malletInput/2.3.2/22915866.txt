  2.3.2 affix bottom jumps between affix and affix-bottom  i'm using     2.3.2 and included the affix js. the div perfectly listens to the top:500px; but has difficulties with the bottom, on reaching bottom, it switches the div name between affix and affix-bottom every pixel. looking nineties flashy, which is nice in a way.., but not really how i would expect it. any ideas on how to stick the bottom on the way it should be? would make my day!!    the js:     $(".my-affix-div").affix({   offset: {     top: 440,     bottom: 270 }      and the css:     .affix{     top:60px; }  .affix-bottom {     bottom:270px;     position: absolute;     top:auto; }
