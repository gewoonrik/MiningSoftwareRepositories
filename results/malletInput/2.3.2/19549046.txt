Collapsed Bootstrap 2.3.2 menu failing on a touch device  I'm running into an error with a collapsed   2.3.2 menu on a touch device.  If you look at the following example:            When you look at the menu expanded on a larger screen both "Go to google.com 1" and "Go to google.com 2" open google.com as expected:     When collapsed on a computer, a mouse click opens both of these links as expected.     However, when collapsed on touch device (I tested on iPad and android) the "Go to google.com 1" link opens but clicking on the menu and then the "Go to google.com 2" link does not open.  It just closes the menu.       Thoughts?
