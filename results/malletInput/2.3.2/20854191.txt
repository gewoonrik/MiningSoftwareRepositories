  2.3.2: using css to wrap featurettes in another container?  so i have the following code, taken from the source code in  this example.       tag. however, this is the result:         the content is leaking out of the right side of the box. it seems like the padding on the right isn't being detected or i'm not coding it correctly; what is the correct way to do this?
