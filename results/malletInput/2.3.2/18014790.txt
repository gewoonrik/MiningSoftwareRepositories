enable back button handling with     tabs in ie8+    2.3.2     i am using  tabs  from   in my project to display content. on a single page there are multiple tabs with different content and in those tabs are links to take the user to other pages on the website.     unfortunately by default, the tabs don't support back button navigation, so if a user visits another page and hits the browser's back button, the tab will have reverted to the first open tab rather than the one that was active when they last viewed the page.    the javascript below from  franã§ois zaninotto  solves this problem in chrome, firefox and safari. franã§ois also says it works for ie8+ - but during my tests i can't get it to work on ie8, ie9 or ie10. does anyone know how to get this working in ie8+ ? is it possible?
