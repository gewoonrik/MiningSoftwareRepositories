Angular css files not loading when controlling two Partials with a single Controller  I'm working on a web-application built upon the MEAN stack. I use   as css lib, and have some css override in two files of mine "app.css" and "mio.css" the app works just fine until I hit      If I inspect them they contain the index.html data (head body dcc)    could you suggest what's happening??
