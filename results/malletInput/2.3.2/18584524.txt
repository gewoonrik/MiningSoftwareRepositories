How to make Bootstrap look more "Compact"  I want to have the same "Compact" look - in terms of   variables in Bootstrap's    .com/2.3.2/customize.html  download screen but I am missing something as the result :        Doesn't look right - in terms of balance, padding is not right.      Breaks on the projector screen (the horror!) - select boxes, layout, everything goes crazy.        Please bail me out!
