how to make   look more "compact"  i want to have the same "compact" look - in terms of  font-size ,  padding  and general use of space as i get when i use the browser zoom-out (ctrl--). of course without the side-effects most importantly reduction in container width.    i have tried fiddling with the  @basefontsize  and  @baselineheight  variables in  's    .com/2.3.2/customize.html  download screen but i am missing something as the result :        doesn't look right - in terms of balance, padding is not right.      breaks on the projector screen (the horror!) - select boxes, layout, everything goes crazy.        please bail me out!
