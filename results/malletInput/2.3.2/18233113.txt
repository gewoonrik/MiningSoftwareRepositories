responsive design with   not working properly  i am trying to append a search button to an input search field which is not working properly.    i am not able to trace the error as i am new to  .    i have set up an example on  jsfiddle     i am trying to make it work in an asp.net webform based website    below is the code snippet              div id="search-wrapper" class="span3 offset5"               div  class="span3 input-append"                   asp:textbox id="txtsearch"  placeholder="search" runat="server"  /asp:textbox                   asp:button id="btnsearch" cssclass="btn" runat="server" text="go!" /               /div           /div         go  button doesn't append properly with the input field. as shown in this  example      i have made some minor changes to css to make it work with max-width:1000px.    rest is almost same. i even tried to use botstrap css directly from cdn but it doesnt make different to the button    update:    i tried changing  .btn  css     .btn {   display: inline-block;   *border-left: 0 none #e6e6e6;     border-right: 0 none #e6e6e6;     border-top: 0 none #e6e6e6;     border-bottom: 0 none #b3b3b3;     display: inline;     padding: 4px 12px;       this line to  padding: 6px 12px;. this minutely fixed it in ff but other browser it make problem worse.
