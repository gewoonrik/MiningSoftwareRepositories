bootbox with jquery and   with a .net page - no working  if i have a .net page with   min and some other js files on the page, it won't run the js files. however, if i move the   form ...> to the end of the file the bootbox javascript works perfectly.    this won't work until you move the form to the end of the file. how come? i want to use a confirm button to make sure the user actually wants to submit the form but i'm starting with this simple example.
