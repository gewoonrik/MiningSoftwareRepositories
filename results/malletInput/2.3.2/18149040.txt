How to create a dedicated side bar menu in Bootstrap  I am really new to Bootstrap and have been fooling around with it. I want to make something like the following:        Main menu        side bar | content        side bar | other content      What I have done so far was to make   class in each row for the side bar, but is there a way to dedicate that side of the page to the side menu and have the other side for content, etc?    EDIT: I am using Bootstrap 2.3.2., not the new 3.0 RC.
