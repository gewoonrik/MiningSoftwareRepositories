how to create a dedicated side bar menu in    i am really new to   and have been fooling around with it. i want to make something like the following:        main menu        side bar | content        side bar | other content      what i have done so far was to make   class in each row for the side bar, but is there a way to dedicate that side of the page to the side menu and have the other side for content, etc?    edit: i am using   2.3.2., not the new 3.0 rc.
