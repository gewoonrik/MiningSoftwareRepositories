Can I Toggle content of Element based on pixel height of element?  Using  Bootstrap 2.3.2  I've previously used a toggle button to show and hide text using the  Collapse plugin  but from what I see it only allows me to reveal and hide the entire contents of an element.     What I need is to already have 170px of the element's content visible and then when the button is clicked, it reveals the rest of the text in the element - but I need to do this without adding any additional elements, it needs to be based on height.    Is this possible with Bootstrap? Or if not, jQuery?
