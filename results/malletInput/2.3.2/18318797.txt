can i toggle content of element based on pixel height of element?  using    2.3.2  i've previously used a toggle button to show and hide text using the  collapse plugin  but from what i see it only allows me to reveal and hide the entire contents of an element.     what i need is to already have 170px of the element's content visible and then when the button is clicked, it reveals the rest of the text in the element - but i need to do this without adding any additional elements, it needs to be based on height.    is this possible with  ? or if not, jquery?
