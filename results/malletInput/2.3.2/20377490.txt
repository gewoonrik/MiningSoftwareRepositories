  dropdown menu and error with $_get  i'm creating a single page site with     scrolling, taken from this example:    . it works but i have a strange problem. from a dropdown menu should pass variables via get but does not work, та in the address bar does not appear any var (for example index.php?id = 1).... it only works when i disable the code at bottom of the page
