How to have the Center Div stack on top with Bootstrap responsive?  I'm using Bootstrap 2.3.2 responsive layouts, and trying to have two different orders for a set of Divs. One order for a full screen horizontal layout, and a different one when they are stacked vertically on a smaller screen.    Using a simple setup like this:         But the horizontal layout comes out as B, A, C.    How can I get the horizontal layout of A, B, C and the vertical of B, A, C?
