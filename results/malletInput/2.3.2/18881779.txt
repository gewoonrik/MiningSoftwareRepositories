how to have the center div stack on top with   responsive?  i'm using   2.3.2 responsive layouts, and trying to have two different orders for a set of divs. one order for a full screen horizontal layout, and a different one when they are stacked vertically on a smaller screen.    using a simple setup like this:         but the horizontal layout comes out as b, a, c.    how can i get the horizontal layout of a, b, c and the vertical of b, a, c?
