twitter   responsive span ordering  I am using twitter's   2.3.2 to build a responsive site.    I am trying to arrange the spans correctly for when you stretch the window from tablet width (768px - 979px) to a laptop/desktop width (980px+)    In the two attached graphics, you can see what the tablet looks like and what it will look like when it is resized to a desktop width.    I know how to accomplish showing spans for only desktop .visible-desktop, but I am not sure how I would stack up the newsletter and check-in club on top of each in the 6th span/2nd row to the far right (in this case).    I've tried setting each span to span4, but it just doesn't display like it should in both views (tablet and desktop).    Any help is appreciated. I assume I might have to use some form of javascript to change spans once a certain width is reached.
