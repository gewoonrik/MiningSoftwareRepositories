  affix not working properly with firefox  i am trying to have a left sidebar in my rails application that uses   affix. i have set up this bootply to share my approach:           it works just like wanted with chrome, but with firefox affix stops working everytime i follow a link (the sidebar is in every page of my app). if i refresh the page affix starts working again. i have used data attributes to add the affix behavior, no javascript at all. should i use javascript? am i doing something else wrong?    i am using   2.3.2.
