  affix not working properly with firefox  I am trying to have a left sidebar in my rails application that uses   affix. I have set up this bootply to share my approach:           It works just like wanted with Chrome, but with Firefox affix stops working everytime I follow a link (the sidebar is in every page of my app). If I refresh the page affix starts working again. I have used data attributes to add the affix behavior, no javascript at all. Should I use javascript? Am I doing something else wrong?    I am using   2.3.2.
