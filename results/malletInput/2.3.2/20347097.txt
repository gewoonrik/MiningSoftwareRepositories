popover-append-to-body attribute for a popover element doesn't seem to work in angular-ui  i am using angular ui. ( docs ,  github )    i would like to make a popover that is appended on body.       in pure  , you have to use  container: 'body'  so that your popover is appended on the body element instead of the parent element of your popover. (see    .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#popovers )     in angular ui, you are supposed to use  popover-append-to-body  (see    /#/popover ).       but i tried this attribute, and my popover is not appended on body. (note that other attributes, such as  placement='right'  do work.)    html for the popover:      a popover="click me" popover-placement='bottom' popover-append-to-body='true'    popover text  /a       note: in the  source , i don't find anything related to  popover-append-to-body
