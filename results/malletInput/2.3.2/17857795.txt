why does last popover link in navbar not centre on object?  i am using  .js to build a simple ui. as part of this ui i want to use a navbar.    on the navbar, i would like to have a popover under each of the items in the navbar. this works ok.    what i have noticed, however is that the popover on the last link item in the nav bar does not position correctly.    it does not matter if the last item is the third of three, or the sixth of six, it is only the last item that is affected.    i can workaround this by not using a popover on the last item, however i do not understand  why  this is occurring.    i have tested this in chrome 28 and firefox 21 locally with the same results.     my question is: why does the last popover in the code below cause a strange rendering issue?      nice example (cursor is hovering over the middle link) :      yucky example (cursor is hovering over the last link):      the code i am using to reproduce this behaviour:
