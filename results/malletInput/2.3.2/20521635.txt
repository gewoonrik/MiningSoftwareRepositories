    2.3.2 carousel: infinite loop after last slide  i was just asked by one of my customers to change his existing     2.3.2 carousel to an infinite loop. just now it does not slide from the last to the first slide but it actually loads the whole image so it looks kinda choppy when the last slide is reached.    i was not able to find anything helpful related to this neither on google nor here so: is there such a feature even existing for the   2.3.2 carousel? is there any easy way to achieve or implement this? i even want to avoid exchanging the whole carousel or move to   3 or anything else :)    i would really appreciate any help or suggestions!    thanks in advance!
