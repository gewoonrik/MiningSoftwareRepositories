  - navbar-fixed-top covers content  i have a question about navbar-fixed-top. well, i have a simple problem with it. my fixed navbar covers content, for example in "about us" page, it covers row with "about us" title.    i have no idea how can i fix it, because when i resize website (mobile devices size) the header is visible.    of course i have this kind of problem with headers in other pages (full width and 404).    also, in index page, it covers some of carousel slider.    information:       website:           2.3.2       let me know, how can i fix it on all resolutions.
