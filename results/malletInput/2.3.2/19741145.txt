Bootstrap - navbar-fixed-top covers content  I have a question about navbar-fixed-top. Well, I have a simple problem with it. My fixed navbar covers content, for example in "About us" page, it covers row with "About us" title.    I have no idea how can I fix it, because when I resize website (mobile devices size) the header is visible.    Of course I have this kind of problem with headers in other pages (Full Width and 404).    Also, in Index page, it covers some of carousel slider.    Information:       website:           2.3.2       Let me know, how can I fix it on all resolutions.
