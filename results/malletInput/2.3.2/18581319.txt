  strange space between spans  i am working with a row to show a product list, with a span9 as a container and each product has a span3 size which gives 3 in each row.    but i am watching a strange phenomenon, some spans are not showing 3 per line.    like this:( see full size image )      the   version is 2.3.2 and i am using the responsive capabilities.    hope someone can help. thanks
