Bootstrap 3 modal change  On the    3 blog  it says: "Modals are way more responsive. We've overhauled the modal code to make it way more responsive on mobile devices. They now scroll the entire viewport instead of having a max-height."    Compare the live demo under    .com/javascript/#modals-examples  and the same under    .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#modals .     I was sort of disappointed when I saw the v3's effect, as I would rather control the modal's height by myself and display the scrollbar within the modal. Do you really feel it's better? In case you dislike it, how can you change it back to the former style without downgrading the  ?
