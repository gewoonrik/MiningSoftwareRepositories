input type=number not possible to insert negative numbers on mobile phone  i'm testing my app on my mobile phone (samsung galaxy note ii with chrome) and i have a problem with the numeric input fields.     in my app these fields can accept negative numbers, and on the browser it's all fine as i have the   sign.  any clue?
