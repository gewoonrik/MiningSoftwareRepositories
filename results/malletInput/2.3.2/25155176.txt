Bootstrap 2.3.2 collapsable navbar not working  I'm developping an app in Rails 4 and I use   2.3.2 with the  -twitter gem.    Here is my navbar:         Sadly it doesn't collapse when I try to display it on a phone. I checked if the regular collapsable menus are working, and they do, so I guess that I'm supposed to have things set up properly. Therefore it must be an error in my code, but I can't find it.    Do you have any clue about what it might be?
