  2.3.2 collapsable navbar not working  i'm developping an app in rails 4 and i use   2.3.2 with the  -  gem.    here is my navbar:         sadly it doesn't collapse when i try to display it on a phone. i checked if the regular collapsable menus are working, and they do, so i guess that i'm supposed to have things set up properly. therefore it must be an error in my code, but i can't find it.    do you have any clue about what it might be?
