Submitting Form Django Bootstrap Toolkit  I'm utilizing the Django Bootstrap Toolkit for styling my website and have run into a slight issue. I am trying to have a form embedded within my base HTML that is essentially a user switch, whereby given a list of names, the user can decide whether he or she wants to switch users while utilizing the site rather than be logged in as "Guest" (the site is internal, so there's no real need for credential authentication). The views I have are such:         I get default Guest login, which is not a problem, but I do not unfortunately get any kind of user switching when the user clicks on the dropdown menu and selects another individual. It is likely I am missing something, but I unfortunately have been unable to figure it out if so. Help is very much appreciated!
