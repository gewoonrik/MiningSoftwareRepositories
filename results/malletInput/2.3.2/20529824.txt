Bootstrap javascript data-attributes - how to rescan  (btw I'm using Bootstrap 2.3.2)    Bootstrap uses data attributes (eg  ) to give a particular set of HTML some functionality without using JavaScript (see  here ).    However, say I have a given page and using jQuery I stick a huge chunk of new HTML into it, and that HTML has these data attributes. Bootstrap doesn't register them.  I'm guessing that's because it does a single pass when the js is loaded and then doesn't know to look again when the DOM changes.    Is there a way to tell Bootstrap to check the page again and apply the logic to the new DOM elements?
