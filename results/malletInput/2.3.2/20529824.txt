  javascript data-attributes - how to rescan  (btw i'm using   2.3.2)      uses data attributes (eg  data-toggle="buttons-radio" ) to give a particular set of html some functionality without using javascript (see  here ).    however, say i have a given page and using jquery i stick a huge chunk of new html into it, and that html has these data attributes.   doesn't register them.  i'm guessing that's because it does a single pass when the js is loaded and then doesn't know to look again when the dom changes.    is there a way to tell   to check the page again and apply the logic to the new dom elements?
