  modal - remote url. can i put the whole modal element into remote.html?  i'm using   2.3.2. according to    .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#modals   if data-remote url is provided, then the content of the url will be injected into .modal-body.     my index.html:         which means  remote content goes here will be inserted into modal-body and replaced  one fine body...     however, i wonder if i can save the whole #mymodel into remote.html ie. take out the #mymodal from index.html and put it into remote.php. i have tried that but it doesn't work.
