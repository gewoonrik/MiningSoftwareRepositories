  modal - remote url. Can I put the whole modal element into remote.html?  I'm using   2.3.2. According to    .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#modals   if data-remote url is provided, then the content of the url will be injected into .modal-body.     My index.html:         which means  remote content goes here will be inserted into modal-body and replaced  One fine body...     However, I wonder if I can save the whole #myModel into remote.html ie. take out the #myModal from index.html and put it into remote.php. I have tried that but it doesn't work.
