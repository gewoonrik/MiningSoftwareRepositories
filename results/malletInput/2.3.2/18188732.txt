toggle active link   navbar  i've read a lot of posts on the subject, found almost always the same solution but it does not work for me...    my problem is as follows : i want to use     2.3.2 and its navbar, so i include the css and js files. just before that, i also include jquery. i then take an example given on the   site which display very well. however, i now want to set the menu item clicked as active and remove the active class from all others. i saw in the  .js file that this function is built in, so no more script code to include. the problem is that the menu items do never toggle to active. i then tried to add a jquery script to force removing all active classes and add the active class to the one item that was clicked. nothing happened.    so please, help !! i tried the same code in jsfiddle and it works fine, so does the problem comes from jade ? from express layout ? how to fix it ?    here is the code i use :     server.js
