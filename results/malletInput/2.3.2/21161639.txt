foreach and continue to create submenu columns  i am using opencart and   2.3.2 in order to try and create submenus with columns. i have created an opencart module which is basically a copy of the category module. i am going to use this module to show the categories in my main navigation in dropdown menus. the problem is that if there are more than 5 categories then i want to create a new column within the dropdown menu.    the php i have so far is:         i have been looking into 'continue' for use within the foreach statement but some of the code (such as adding the span6 class to the ul) falls outside of the foreach statement. how can i modify my code in order to get the desired outcome?
