change sphinx's template for table of contents  i am using sphinx with my own template to get a documentation style like the     documentation:    .com/2.3.2/getting-started.html     there you can see the navigation on the left, which is static and stays at the same place as you scroll.    it is therefore nescessary to render the table of contents which i already achieved with this function:     {{ toctree(maxdepth=1, collapse=false, includehidden=true) }}      that outputs me the following:      ul class="current"       li class="toctree-l1 current"  a class="current reference internal" href="" introduction /a  /li       li class="toctree-l1"  a class="reference internal" href="#installation" installation /a  /li       li class="toctree-l1"  a class="reference internal" href="#roadmap" roadmap /a  /li   /ul       but in order to let it work with   i need the following output:      ul class="nav nav-list bs-docs-sidenav"       li  a href="#introduction"  i class="icon-chevron-right"  /i  introduction /a  /li       li  a href="#installation"  i class="icon-chevron-right"  /i  installation /a  /li       li  a href="#roadmap"  i class="icon-chevron-right"  /i  roadmap /a  /li   /ul       so my question is: how can i achieve that? is there a template file for the  toctree()  function i can adjust?
