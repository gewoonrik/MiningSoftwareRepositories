Change Sphinx's template for table of contents  I am using Sphinx with my own template to get a documentation style like the twitter   documentation:    .com/2.3.2/getting-started.html     There you can see the navigation on the left, which is static and stays at the same place as you scroll.    It is therefore nescessary to render the table of contents which I already achieved with this function:      function I can adjust?
