keep     nav-collapse from expanding on some elements  using   2.3.2, i'm using  class="nav-collapse collapse"  to hide certain elements when the browser width shrinks. i'd like to keep some elements collapsed even when the user clicks the toggle button to expand the navigation. is there some class i can apply to elements to do this?
