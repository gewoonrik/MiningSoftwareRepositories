spinedit vertically aligned buttons  i'm using     2.3.2. i'm trying to display spinedit buttons next to an input control. currently i've got it looking like this:         using the following html:      div class="input-append"       input type="text" class="input-mini" type="text"       span class="btn-group"           button class="btn"               i class="icon icon-chevron-up"  /i           /button           button class="btn"               i class="icon icon-chevron-down"  /i           /button       /span   /div       you can see a live demo here:           however i'm trying to get it to look more like the default look and feel for a spinedit control:         is it possible to align them like this next to the input, without any custom css?
