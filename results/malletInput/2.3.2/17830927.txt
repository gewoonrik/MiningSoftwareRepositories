vertically center checkbox in   table cell  i want to vertically center a checkbox inside a   table cell, and this is what i have now:          example here:    . it is clear that the checkbox is positioned towards the lower half of the cell.    notice that in the fiddle above, i've already tried the solution in this question:  centering a button vertically in table cell, using     , but it doesn't seem to work in my case.    i'm using the latest   2.3.2, if that makes a difference.
