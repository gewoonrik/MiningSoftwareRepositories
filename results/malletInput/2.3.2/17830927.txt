Vertically center checkbox in Bootstrap table cell  I want to vertically center a checkbox inside a Bootstrap table cell, and this is what I have now:          Example here:    . It is clear that the checkbox is positioned towards the lower half of the cell.    Notice that in the fiddle above, I've already tried the solution in this question:  Centering a button vertically in table cell, using Twitter Bootstrap , but it doesn't seem to work in my case.    I'm using the latest Bootstrap 2.3.2, if that makes a difference.
