setting default width to 960px for large desktops in      i am using joomla3 with the     for the first time. i want my maximum widht to be 960 - so really i want to do away with the last responsive option.    i went to the customise page    .com/2.3.2/customize.html  and unchecked the "large desktops" option and downloaded etc    i put the two cs and js files in media/jui/css and media/jui/js but it didn't make any difference.    so i then tired this again, but altering the @gridcolumnwidth1200 and @gridgutterwidth1200 to 60 and 20 (with and without the large desktops checked)    nothing seems to make any difference so i guess i am doing something wrong    can anyone please help    thanks
