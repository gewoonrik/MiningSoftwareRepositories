setting default width to 960px for large desktops in twitter    I am using joomla3 with the twitter   for the first time. I want my maximum widht to be 960 - so really I want to do away with the last responsive option.    I went to the customise page    .com/2.3.2/customize.html  and unchecked the "large desktops" option and downloaded etc    I put the two cs and js files in media/jui/css and media/jui/js but it didn't make any difference.    So I then tired this again, but altering the @gridColumnWidth1200 and @gridGutterWidth1200 to 60 and 20 (with and without the large desktops checked)    Nothing seems to make any difference so I guess I am doing something wrong    Can anyone please help    Thanks
