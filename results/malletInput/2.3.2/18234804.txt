  v2.3.3 navbar gets overlapped by collapse content  i am having an issue on my site where i have a   (version 2.3.2)  navbar  fixed to the top of the page and then later in the body i have a    collapse  object with a large amount of content in   pre> code>  tags. the  collapse  opens and closes as expected; however, when i scroll down the page, the content in the   pre> code>  tags overlaps the  navbar  at the top of the page. i have  attempted  to add   z-index 's to both the  navbar  and the  collapse  content; however, it doesn't seem to be working.    below are the jsfiddle links. the offending overlapping content is at the end of the page. thanks!   my code:       full screen result:
