Stackable Bootstrap modal firing show event on wrong modal  I am using   2.3.2 and the following plugin to manage multiple modal:        -modal/     I have 2 modal,  modal_one shows when i click a button on the page and modal-two shows when i click a button inside modal_one.         When i click on the button inside the modal_one it should show modal_two which it works fine but it trigger a show event on the modal_one not modal_two.    Does the plugin has something do with it?    Thanks in advance.
