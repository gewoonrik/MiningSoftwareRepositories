Bootstrap input-group-addon does not work  I have just upgraded from   2.3.2.  I have copy / pasted the example from the documentation but the add-on doesn't have effect on the character within.    The code I am trying:         The @ just looks like a normal at with no background or anything.    What am I doing wrong?
