  input-group-addon does not work  i have just upgraded from   2.3.2.  i have copy / pasted the example from the documentation but the add-on doesn't have effect on the character within.    the code i am trying:      div class="input-group"       span class="input-group-addon" @ /span       input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="username"   /div       the @ just looks like a normal at with no background or anything.    what am i doing wrong?
