Making some parts of content responsive  I am making a joomla module and i want it to be responsive for different mobile devices. As a joomla module injects some contents in a specific part of the whole page, so other contents of the page may not be responsive unless the template is responsive.In this case if the whole page template is not responsive, how do i make the content of my that module responsive??  I read some articles about making whole site responsive but not some parts of content.So then to start achieving my goal, if this meta is necessary to be put in the page -                how it affects other non-responsive content of the site page? on the other hand, is it difficult and bad practice to show responsiveness for some parts of content instead of whole?     My approach: I tried to use  t    responsive feature by putting all classes in  .css and  -responsive.css under a custom class ".container_class" and placed my all content in module under that class so that only module content inherits   styles, and without declaring above meta content, i saw that if i resize browser,  content of the module resized but did not test fully taking into account some other things.So is this approach fruitful..?? or how do i achieve my goal?
