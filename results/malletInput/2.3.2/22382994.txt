align captions center & under the featurette image in    's carousel template  i'm trying to align a figure caption centered and underneath the  featurette  images in    's carousel template:       .com/2.3.2/examples/carousel.html     does anyone know how this can be done and have it still work responsively? i tried adding this html:      figure     img class="featurette-image pull-right image-responsive" src="../images/file.jpg"     figcaption caption here /figcaption   /figure       and this css:     figure {   display:inline-block;   margin:10px;   vertical-align:top; }  figure img {   display:block;   margin:0 auto; }  figcaption {   display:block;   padding:8px; }      ...to the template's existing code but that wasn't even close. is there a simple solution to this that works within the carousel template's html/css?    this is the general featurette section html:      div class="featurette"       a href="#" target="_blank"         figure           img class="featurette-image pull-right image-responsive" data-toggle="tooltip" title="title" src="../images/image.jpg"           figcaption test /figcaption         /figure       /a        h2 class="featurette-heading" text:  span class="muted" text /span  /h2       p class="lead" some text. /p     /div       a centered caption under the three large browser icon images to be specific!        .com/2.3.2/examples/carousel.html
