apply     less to my own .less stylesheet not working  in     v. 2.3.2  navbar.less  file, you can find this code:     // active nav items .navbar .nav   .active   a, .navbar .nav   .active   a:hover, .navbar .nav   .active   a:focus {   color: @navbarlinkcoloractive;   text-decoration: none;   background-color: @navbarlinkbackgroundactive;   .box-shadow(inset 0 3px 8px rgba(0,0,0,.125)); }      now, the 'problem' is that my 'li' does not have the class  .active , but  .current-menu-item . but i still want to apply the above css to the  a  element. so in my own  style.less  file, i added:     li.current-menu-item a {   .navbar .nav   .active   a; }      but for some reason this is not working. i'm not able to figure out why it is not working. to illustrate, i want to give a example that is working.    in     v. 2.3.2 you can find  type.less  that has the following code:     // single-line list items ul.inline, ol.inline {   margin-left: 0;   list-style: none;     li {     display: inline-block;     .ie7-inline-block();     padding-left: 5px;     padding-right: 5px;   } }      for horizontal menu, where in the source code my  ul  element does not have a class  .inline , but  .menu , i simply do this in my own  style.less :     ul.menu {    ul.inline; }      that is working with no problems at all. can anybody help me out?
