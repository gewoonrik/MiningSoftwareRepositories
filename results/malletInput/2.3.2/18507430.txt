row inside   collapse  i'm using   2.3.2 for a website which contains an accordion element with one row within it. accordion is span6 and i expected that the row will be able to contain two span3 elements but it can't. here is my code simplified:         i was able to make them appear next to each other, but only with some nasty css fiddling, which only works on my screen size.    expected behaviour:     actual result:        if i put that row outside of accordion element everything looks perfect.
