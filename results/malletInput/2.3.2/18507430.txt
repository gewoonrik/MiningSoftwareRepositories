row inside   collapse  i'm using   2.3.2 for a website which contains an accordion element with one row within it. accordion is span6 and i expected that the row will be able to contain two span3 elements but it can't. here is my code simplified:      div class="span6"       div class="accordion" id="accordion2"           div class="accordion-group"               div class="accordion-heading"                   a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2" href="#collapseone"                       p  h3 some text here /h3  /p                   /a               /div               div id="collapseone" class="accordion-body collapse"                   div class="accordion-inner"                       div class="row"                           br /                           div class="span3 offer"                               div class="offer-wrap"                                  this one should be on the left                              /div                           /div                           div class="span3 offer"                               div class="offer-wrap"                                  this one should be on the right, but is below                              /div                           /div                       /div                   /div               /div           /div       /div   /div       i was able to make them appear next to each other, but only with some nasty css fiddling, which only works on my screen size.    expected behaviour:     actual result:        if i put that row outside of accordion element everything looks perfect.
