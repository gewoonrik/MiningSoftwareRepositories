Row inside   collapse  I'm using Bootstrap 2.3.2 for a website which contains an accordion element with one row within it. Accordion is span6 and I expected that the row will be able to contain two span3 elements but it can't. Here is my code simplified:         I was able to make them appear next to each other, but only with some nasty CSS fiddling, which only works on my screen size.    Expected behaviour:     Actual result:        If I put that row outside of accordion element everything looks perfect.
