Angular boilerplate and Twitter Bootstrap 3  I am trying to use this project     but with Twitter Bootstrap 3. I find no posts on how to do that. Is it because:      It can't be done   It shouldn't be done   I am the only one in the world who wants to do that   There are other better ways to do that.       I am afraid that using Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 as this boilerplate code comes with is old. Am I right?    I have tried to fix it myself but I give up the jungle world of JavaScript scripts and bugs that must be combined in a top secret order and maybe if you are lucky you don't get an error. Please help me.
