angular boilerplate and     3  i am trying to use this project     but with     3. i find no posts on how to do that. is it because:      it can't be done   it shouldn't be done   i am the only one in the world who wants to do that   there are other better ways to do that.       i am afraid that using     2.3.2 as this boilerplate code comes with is old. am i right?    i have tried to fix it myself but i give up the jungle world of javascript scripts and bugs that must be combined in a top secret order and maybe if you are lucky you don't get an error. please help me.
