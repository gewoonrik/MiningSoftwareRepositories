using fullcalendar in a   popover  i'm currently using   2.3.2, and i want to add a popover containing a calendar (using fullcalendar) in the navbar.    in order to do so, i created a nav item (called "timetop"), and add a popover, using html option for content.          this work (my calendar is correctly added to my popover), but i'm encountering a display problem. my popover doesn't show my calendar, only the headers.    i made a fiddle reproducing my problem :        here, i have 2 calendars :       one in the popover, showing only the calendar header.     one in the main div, also showing only the calendar header.       (this seems to be the same problem. using the code in a local page will show the main content containing the calendar, and the popover containing only the headers).    i'm aware of the existence of fullcalendar('render'), but i couldn't make it work in my case (i don't know when my popover is displayed).    my goal is to have a fullcalendar for the popover, with a result like this :        thanks a lot for your help.
