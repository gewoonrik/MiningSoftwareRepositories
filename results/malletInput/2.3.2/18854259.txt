why did   3 switch to box-sizing: border-box?  i'm migrating my   themes from v2.3.2 to v3.0.0 and one thing i noticed is that a lot of dimensions are calculated differently, due to the following styles in  .css.     *, *:before, *:after {   -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;      -moz-box-sizing: border-box;           box-sizing: border-box; }      can anyone explain why   switches the box-sizing of all elements to border-box? i suspect it has to do with the new grid system being percent-based, but the selector above does not only apply to the grid elements obviously.    seems a bit radical imho :-)    anyone care to give some insight?
