Popover doesn't show up on dynamically generated div  I'm trying to display a custom    popover :    popover:      class is the div inside the sortable where the popover should show up. My guess is the initialization of the popover is wrong but I couldn't get it right.    What I want to do is:      When an item ( i.e item 1 ) is clicked show popover   But when another item ( i.e item 2 ) is clicked hide all other popover and show the popover beside this item.        UPDATE:     Here is a  fiddle  when I put the initialization on the onClick event it shows the popover but not to my desire behavior.
