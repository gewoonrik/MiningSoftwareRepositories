popover doesn't show up on dynamically generated div  i'm trying to display a custom    popover :    popover:      class is the div inside the sortable where the popover should show up. my guess is the initialization of the popover is wrong but i couldn't get it right.    what i want to do is:      when an item ( i.e item 1 ) is clicked show popover   but when another item ( i.e item 2 ) is clicked hide all other popover and show the popover beside this item.        update:     here is a  fiddle  when i put the initialization on the onclick event it shows the popover but not to my desire behavior.
