Using   for commerical site?  I'm creating a website using django and since im not that strong in html/css (i can code and create layouts, but not the ones that look professional enough) i thought i might use the Bootstrap open source product, originally created by twitter.     Bootstrap is using the Apache License 2.0 as far as i can see and when reading it there does not seem to be any problems using it for commerical perposes...but i still wanted to ask since reading terms and condition isnt something i do every day and im not a lawyer.. can i use    (   .com/2.3.2/ ) for commercial websites ?
