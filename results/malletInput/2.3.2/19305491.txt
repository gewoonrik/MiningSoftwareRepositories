960px width responsive   container rails app  I'm using   2.3.2 to make a website, and I want the max width of the container to be 960px wide rather than 1200px. I know that on the  customize  page unchecking the 1200px wide container option will not include that in the CSS, however my problem now is implementing that back into my rails app. I'm not sure where the   file is located or how I could replace it. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.
