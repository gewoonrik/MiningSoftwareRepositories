responsive design or fluid grid system  i am trying to create a full responsive web template using   2.3.2. as you are fully aware   is offering both responsive design and fluid grid system systems.to be honest i am kind of confused here? what is the different between these too? which one has a better performance? i have ssen some example using      div class="row-fluid"       can i use this in responsive design format as well? is it going be different than using simply         div class="row"       thanks
