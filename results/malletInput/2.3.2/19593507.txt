Bootstrap sticky footer not sticking  I have some problems with my footer in a free   template. I tried multiple solutions other people gave already but without result.    The code seems to be too long to post here so I uploaded the html file and assets to my server here;        As you can see in my css I tried setting 100% height for the body, then making a wrapper div and a push div. It does push the footer somewhat down but not all the way to the end of the screen. For some reason it doesn't seem to pick up the 100% height on the body I think?    The method above obviously works here;    .com/2.3.2/examples/sticky-footer.html  but doesn't seem to work on my template, why is that?
