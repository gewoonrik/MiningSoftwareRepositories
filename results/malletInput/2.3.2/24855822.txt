show specific alert, depending on the value of get in php  im learning php, html and  -  (v2.3.2). i'm trying to display a message depending on the value received by get.    i have two alerts in different sections of the site and i want depending on the value received by get display one or the other. not both.    i.e: http:localhost/test.php?load=lannister, should show the message: "a lannister always pays his debts". however, the url: http:localhost/test.php?load=stark, should show the message: "you know nothing john snow". but i can not figure how to do this, i need a hand, i thought it could be done with an if-else, but i fail to understand how to do it at all. any ideas?    heres the code:         i know it's a silly question, but i've been thinking how to do it for hours without any success. thanks in advance
