rails issue : "couldn't find file ' /css/ ''  i m new to ror and could not able to fix the error "couldn't find file ' /css/ ".    i went through many posts but nothing fixes my issue. there seems either problem in gem file (something needed upgrade or remove) or application.css.scss file which could not find the ' /css/ ' or in "_stylesheets.html.haml" which call the stylesheets.     could someone pls suggest on this?        error:     actionview::template::error (couldn't find file ' /css/ '   (in /root/rails_project/res_dash/app/assets/stylesheets/custom.css.scss:11)):
