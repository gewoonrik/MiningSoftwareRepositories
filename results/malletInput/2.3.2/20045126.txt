Rails Issue : "couldn't find file ' /css/ ''  I m new to RoR and could not able to fix the error "couldn't find file ' /css/ ".    I went through many posts but nothing fixes my issue. There seems either problem in Gem file (something needed upgrade or remove) OR application.css.scss file which could not find the ' /css/ ' OR in "_stylesheets.html.haml" which call the stylesheets.     Could someone pls suggest on this?        Error:     ActionView::Template::Error (couldn't find file ' /css/ '   (in /root/rails_project/res_dash/app/assets/stylesheets/custom.css.scss:11)):
