    3 navigation icon doesn't expand in their examples  i'm new to    . when i go to the examples for version 3 in both firefox and chrome when i shrink my browser window the navigation collapses to the icon with three horizontal lines. however when i click on that icon i don't get the accordian expanding to see the navigation links.     if i view the examples for v2.3.2 it works just fine.     is there a work-around at this time for v3 or do people recommend using the older version until this is fixed if this navigation feature is something you really need?     v2.3.2 example that works    .com/2.3.2/examples/starter-template.html     v3.0.0 that doesn't work.     .com/starter-template/index.html
