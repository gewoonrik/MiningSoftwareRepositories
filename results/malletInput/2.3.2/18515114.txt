how to use same style as   2.3.2 in  3  to me,   3 doesn't look very nice and i find the    2.3.2 much nicer! now my question is is there any way to use new functions and style added to  3 but still use the same style? i already ried to customize   based on    2.3.2 but i couldn't figure out how to define some of the changes. for example: in  3 the  @line-height-base  is 1.428571429 and this parameter in   2.3.2 is  @baselineheight: 20px      update:       thanks
