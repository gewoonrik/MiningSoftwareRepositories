writing  's   with upgrading to v3 in mind  how would you write a new application using   2.3.2 if you wanted to make the upgrade path as painless as possible?    for example, i know that   classes are going away, so i would create a custom less class for each of those classes that has a mixin of that definition, or create a macro in my templating language to output the class name instead of using it directly.     also, is there a   3 migration guide? i couldnt find one.     so, what steps would you take to ease the upgrade?
