rails:   dropdown menu not working  i am quite new to rails and have been following the tutorial by michael hartl.  everything has been going along really well until i got to the drop down menu, which was wasn't working, then was working and now isn't working :(  i've read several posts and fixes and i suspect my tinkering has gotten to the point where quite simply, i've done something to stop it working. i will say that i initially had the  -sass 2.x in my gem file, then changed it to 3.x, but went back to 2.x because i didn't realise that going to 3.x would result in issues due to class name changes.  so, perhaps the time this was working was when i had  -sass 3.x installed, not sure.  from what i can tell though everything is set up the way it needs to be.  i am developing under windows 8.1 and i had to fix an issue with execjs and in specific the runtimes.rb file.  so, here are my details:    gemfile:         would really appreciate some help on this to get past this issue.    thanks in advance, and please let me know if i can provide anymore information.
