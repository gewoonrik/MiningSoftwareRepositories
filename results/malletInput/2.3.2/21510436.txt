jquery +   2.3.2 popover not working with $(this).next  I've got a table with checkboxes. When the checkbox is checked there should be an twitter   popover with a form in it. This form is dependent to its checkbox. therefore i will render hidden forms and show them in an twitter popover.    But when I try to access the popover content with $(this).next(".my_class").html(); it's not working. When I render fixed content with return $("#my_id").html();    Here is an example (here as   jsfiddle  ):     My html tables          How could I get this to work with dynamic selection?
