jquery +   2.3.2 popover not working with $(this).next  i've got a table with checkboxes. when the checkbox is checked there should be an     popover with a form in it. this form is dependent to its checkbox. therefore i will render hidden forms and show them in an   popover.    but when i try to access the popover content with $(this).next(".my_class").html(); it's not working. when i render fixed content with return $("#my_id").html();    here is an example (here as   jsfiddle  ):     my html tables          how could i get this to work with dynamic selection?
