How to Override   img height and width properties?  I use twitter   2.3.2, there is this issue which is discussed in many places but still helpless. Bootstrap has specified          When I render an image the height and width attributes of img tag are overridden by this css of  . I want to override this style unfortunately through css I am unable to do it. The problem is especially in IE as they have used IE specific style property.    Fiddle link:      The image looks smaller in chrome and firefox but in IE looks larger as in the original image size.    Other ways of fixing which I referred are     /issues/1899  - This is not working  I tried. Similar SO issue  How do I reset a twitter   reset to the browser&#39;s original     What I am looking for is I cannot set the height and width via inline style attribute as the image is added via third party editor. Also I use the  .css directly not the less file or any other way.    Are there any fix for this issue or I should directly remove the css from  .css ?
