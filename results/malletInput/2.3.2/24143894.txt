from   2.3.2 to   3 how to change control group?  i am in the process of upgrading the latest  . however we use the following code a lot throughout all the forms       form class="form-horizontal"       div class="control-group"      @html.labelfor(model =  model.name, new { @class = "control-label" })      div class="controls"          @html.editorfor(model =  model.name)         @html.validationmessagefor(model =  model.name)      /div      /div     /form       i am aware controls has gone in   3 and control-group has been replaced by form-group.    but once we have changed those once i can see that we still do not get the same view as before. this is the reason that   3 is focusing on mobile first approach. to get the same style we probably need to use grid view to resize the width of the inputs.    but i cannot figure out how to display (where to display) the error validation message?    what would be the best code to replace these forms to get similar view?
