From Bootstrap 2.3.2 to Bootstrap 3 how to change control group?  I am in the process of upgrading the latest Bootstrap. However we use the following code a lot throughout all the forms          I am aware controls has gone in Bootstrap 3 and control-group has been replaced by form-group.    But once we have changed those once I can see that we still do not get the same view as before. This is the reason that Bootstrap 3 is focusing on Mobile first approach. to get the same style we probably need to use grid view to resize the width of the inputs.    But I cannot figure out how to display (where to display) the error validation message?    What would be the best code to replace these forms to get similar view?
