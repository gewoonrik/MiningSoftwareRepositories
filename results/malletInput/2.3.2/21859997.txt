  carousel caption opacity  i have created an image carousel using     2.3.2 but when resizing the browser/viewing on a smaller screened device the caption background loses it opacity.     an example can be seen on the   website at    .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#carousel     (try resizing the browser to mobile screen size, the caption background changes to a solid colour) what is causing this? how can this be overriden?
