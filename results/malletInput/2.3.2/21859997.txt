Bootstrap carousel caption opacity  I have created an image Carousel using Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 but when resizing the browser/viewing on a smaller screened device the caption background loses it opacity.     An example can be seen on the   website at    .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#carousel     (try resizing the browser to mobile screen size, the caption background changes to a solid colour) What is causing this? How can this be overriden?
