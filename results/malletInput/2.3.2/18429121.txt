Inline Form nested within Horizontal Form in Bootstrap 3  I want to build a form in Bootstrap 3 like this:         My site (not the above link) just updates from Bootstrap 2.3.2 and the format is not correct anymore.    I cannot find any doc about this type of form on  get .com .    Could anyone tell me how to do this? Only 'Username' would be OK.    Thanks.     PS  There is a  similar question  but it's using Bootstrap 2.3.2.
