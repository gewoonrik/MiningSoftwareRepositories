tapestry 5.4 call jquery more than once  i am trying to integrate    popover  to my tapestry 5.4-alpha-14 application. i am new to tapestry, and i am not sure how to use javascript there.     my problem is that i want to show   popover on each element in a zone loop when the zone is refreshed. first i have no elements in the zone, then the user submits a form and an element is loaded, and then some more user interaction, and another element is loaded, and so on... i want to show the popover on each loaded element in the loop. with the code bellow i was able to show the popover only when the first element was loaded, but then when the second is loaded the popover was lost. i also notice that the .js code was not called on the second load.    part of the .tml code:      t:zone t:id="selectedpageszone" id="selectedpageszone"    div class="well" t:type="loop" t:id="selectedloop" t:source="selectedpages" t:value="item"       div class="pop" data-toggle="popover" rel="popover" data-placement="top"  data-container="body" data-content="content" title="title"          ...       /div      /div   /t:zone       part of the .java code:     void onsuccess() { ... ajaxresponserenderer.addrender(selectedpageszone).ajaxresponserenderer.addcallback(new javascriptcallback() {    public void run(javascriptsupport javascriptsupport) {       javascriptsupport.require("popover");     } });      the popover.js code:     (function ($) { options = {     placement:'right',     trigger: 'hover',     container: 'body',     html: true   } $('.pop').popover(options); $('.pop').popover('show'); })(window.jquery);      i would appreciate any help you can give me.
