Tapestry 5.4 call jquery more than once  I am trying to integrate  Bootstrap popover  to my Tapestry 5.4-alpha-14 application. I am new to Tapestry, and I am not sure how to use javascript there.     My problem is that I want to show Bootstrap popover on each element in a zone loop when the zone is refreshed. First I have no elements in the zone, then the user submits a form and an element is loaded, and then some more user interaction, and another element is loaded, and so on... I want to show the popover on each loaded element in the loop. With the code bellow I was able to show the popover only when the first element was loaded, but then when the second is loaded the popover was lost. I also notice that the .js code was not called on the second load.    Part of the .tml code:         I would appreciate any help you can give me.
