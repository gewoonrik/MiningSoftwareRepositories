  modal component quickly appearing/slowly disappears  the modal in the current edition of   i'm using (v2.3.2 if i'm not mistaken) quickly appears and, kinda- maybe it's me, slowly disappears. at first it worked ok, but after inserting a search bar and form in a jumbotron div, it just blew up. i tried reverting my code, but the problem still persists. emptied the cache and everything, and still. suggestions?    html:
