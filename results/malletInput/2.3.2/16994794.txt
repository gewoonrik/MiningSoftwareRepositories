Bootstrap Modal Component Quickly Appearing/Slowly Disappears  The Modal in the current edition of Bootstrap I'm using (v2.3.2 if I'm not mistaken) quickly appears and, kinda- maybe it's me, slowly disappears. At first it worked ok, but after inserting a search bar and form in a jumbotron div, it just blew up. I tried reverting my code, but the problem still persists. Emptied the cache and everything, and still. Suggestions?    HTML:
