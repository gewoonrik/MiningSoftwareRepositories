How do I collapse a table row in Bootstrap?  I am using Bootstrap 2.3.2 in my app and I need to completely hide a row using the collapse plugin.  Below is an example:         This will correctly show and hide the contents of the row, but the collapsed row is still visible.  See this screenshot:         The grey line in the screenshot shows the extra row.  What can I do to completely remove this row from view?
