how do i collapse a table row in  ?  i am using   2.3.2 in my app and i need to completely hide a row using the collapse plugin.  below is an example:         this will correctly show and hide the contents of the row, but the collapsed row is still visible.  see this screenshot:         the grey line in the screenshot shows the extra row.  what can i do to completely remove this row from view?
