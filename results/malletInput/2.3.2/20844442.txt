  2.3.2 css is breaking page-break-before in safari(?)  i'm trying to put some page breaks into a page with  page-break-before .  the site is built around   2.3.2; what i have is working fine in mac chrome and firefox, but not safari (7.0.1).  a greatly stripped-down version of one of my pages (also available at    ):      !doctype html   html lang="en"   head     meta charset="utf-8"     meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /     title storyboards for  project 1 /title     style @import url(" .css"); /style     style type='text/css'          .vr_pagebreak {                 page-break-before: always;         }    /style   /head   body       div id="main_container" class="container"           div class="row"             section class="span12"               h1 class="page-header" a general page header /h1                div class='vr_pagebreak'  /div               h2 scene 741: alice places the call /h2               p something about the scene and image. /p                div class='vr_pagebreak'  /div               h2 scene 2314: scene with no takes (2314) /h2               p something about the scene and image. /p             /section           /div      /div   /body   /html       (there are a few drupalisms in here, left over from the original site, but not many at this point.)   .css  is simply a copy of the   2.3.2 css file.  if it's removed from this page, my page breaks work correctly in safari (as well as in other browsers).  fwiw, adding a bit of text to the  vr_pagebreak  divs has no effect, nor does putting the  vr_pagebreak  css into a  @media print  wrapper.    i've looked through the   code, and don't see anything that might be getting in the way.  does any of this ring a bell with anyone?
