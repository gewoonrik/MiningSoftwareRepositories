how does   create spans from @columnwidth?  i'm trying to modify   2.3.2's default 940px grid to something a little wider.     i changed  $columnwidth , thinking that would do it, but there must be another step involved in calculating the widths of the individual spans. when i set the width of a div as  $columnwidth , the value is correct, but when i set use eg .span2 it uses the default column width.    so somewhere there's a formula taking  $columnwidth  and turning it into spans. seems basic, but i'm stumped.    thanks for any help.
