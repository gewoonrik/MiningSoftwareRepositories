Changing navbar color in Twitter's Bootstrap 2.3.2  I've looked at other posts addressing this question, but I still can't seem to able to change the background color the navbar in Twitter Bootstrap. I'm using version 2.3.2. I did everything described by baptme in this post  Change navbar color in twitter   2.0.4  . Here's the CSS I'm using to override the original  .css file.           The only thing that changes when I run this is that the active "home" link has the #c79810 background color. Everything else still has the default black background color.    Also, I really don't care about having a gradient unless it's required. Just a solid background color is fine.    Any ideas as to what I'm doing wrong? Thanks!
