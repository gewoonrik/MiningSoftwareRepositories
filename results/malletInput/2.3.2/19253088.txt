Customizing number of columns in Bootstrap 3  Update:    For anyone who happens upon this question:  This issue seems to have been resolved in a subsequent update to Bootstrap.  You can now download a custom Bootstrap 3 build, specifying the number of desired columns with the   setting.       .com/customize/     Original Question:    I'm trying to customize the Bootstrap 3 grid system to use 24 columns rather than the default 12.    As recommended in a number of answers here, I'm attempting to customize the assets using Bootstrap's "Customize and Download" page by modifying the  @gridColumns ,  @gridColumnWidth , and  @gridGutterWidth  variables.      But Bootstrap 3 seems to have done away with those variables:       Bootstrap 3 customization page (e.g., no @gridColumns):     .com/customize/      Bootstrap 2 customization page (e.g., @gridColumns option available):     .com/2.3.2/customize.html        What would be the recommended way of achieving this in Bootstrap 3?  Many thanks!
