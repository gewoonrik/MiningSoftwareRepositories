customizing number of columns in   3  update:    for anyone who happens upon this question:  this issue seems to have been resolved in a subsequent update to  .  you can now download a custom   3 build, specifying the number of desired columns with the   setting.       .com/customize/     original question:    i'm trying to customize the   3 grid system to use 24 columns rather than the default 12.    as recommended in a number of answers here, i'm attempting to customize the assets using  's "customize and download" page by modifying the  @gridcolumns ,  @gridcolumnwidth , and  @gridgutterwidth  variables.      but   3 seems to have done away with those variables:         3 customization page (e.g., no @gridcolumns):     .com/customize/        2 customization page (e.g., @gridcolumns option available):     .com/2.3.2/customize.html        what would be the recommended way of achieving this in   3?  many thanks!
