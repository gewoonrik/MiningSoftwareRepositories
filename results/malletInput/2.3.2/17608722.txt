Bootstrap dropdown suddenly stopped working  I'm working on a website mock up when all of a sudden the drop down menu disappeared. The version of CSS and JS I'm using are:     .js +  .css v2.3.2 jQuery.js 1.9.1           I know the   drop down example is using jquery.js v.1.10 but I tested it with v.1.9.1 and it still works.    Anyone has any idea why my dropdown doesn't work?    THank you very much for your help.
