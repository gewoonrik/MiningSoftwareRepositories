  dropdown suddenly stopped working  i'm working on a website mock up when all of a sudden the drop down menu disappeared. the version of css and js i'm using are:     .js +  .css v2.3.2 jquery.js 1.9.1           i know the   drop down example is using jquery.js v.1.10 but i tested it with v.1.9.1 and it still works.    anyone has any idea why my dropdown doesn't work?    thank you very much for your help.
