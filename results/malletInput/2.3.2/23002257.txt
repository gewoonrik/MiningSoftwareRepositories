    tab navigation not working  i followed the documentation for     2.3.2 on how to implement tabbing. the home page has a carousel and that's basically it. when i click the next tab button i expect to see the carousel replaced with test text. the onclick function is operational because i can see the url change to #about or #services etc. any suggested ideas?     script calls:
