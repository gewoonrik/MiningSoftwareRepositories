Twitter Bootstrap tab navigation not working  I followed the documentation for Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 on how to implement tabbing. The home page has a Carousel and that's basically it. When I click the next tab button I expect to see the Carousel replaced with test text. The onClick function is operational because I can see the url change to #about or #services etc. Any suggested ideas?     Script calls:
