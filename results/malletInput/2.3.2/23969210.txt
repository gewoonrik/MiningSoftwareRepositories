r shiny using deprecated    i am building a shiny app and have been looking into editing the   themes.    i am using the latest version of shiny (0.9.1), which i have noticed uses   version 2.3.2 (see  here ), which is deprecated (see  here ).    among other changes, version 3 of   has integrated the  -responsive.css into  .css, and the same for the .min files.    is there a way of forcing shiny to use the latest  ?  i'm rolling the app across different machines and a linux server, so would like to minimise custom changes which could break elsewhere.
