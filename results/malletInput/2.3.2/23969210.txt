R Shiny Using Deprecated Bootstrap  I am building a Shiny app and have been looking into editing the   themes.    I am using the latest version of Shiny (0.9.1), which I have noticed uses   version 2.3.2 (see  here ), which is deprecated (see  here ).    Among other changes, version 3 of   has integrated the  -responsive.css into  .css, and the same for the .min files.    Is there a way of forcing Shiny to use the latest  ?  I'm rolling the app across different machines and a Linux server, so would like to minimise custom changes which could break elsewhere.
