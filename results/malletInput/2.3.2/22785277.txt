use   theme with rails/ember  recently i created an authentication system with rails/ember and the functionality is perfect however i want to add   navbar for example but when i do with the gem  -sass it just overrides my code and displays just a big dark bar at the top    what i want the app to do is to display the navbar after login. in my login.handlebars template i have the code:                          {{#if session.isauthenticated}}                         button {{ action 'invalidatesession' }} logout /button                        {{else}}                         button {{ action 'authenticatesession' }} login /button                       {{/if}}                        /hr                       {{outlet}}      what tends to happen when i revert to the   css link:                         link href="//netdna. cdn.com/ - /2.3.2/css/ -combined.no-icons.min.css" rel="stylesheet"       is that login button doesn't go away when authenticated. so, it displays the button login and right beneath the button logout button. without all the style it runs normally with the buttons not repeating themselves.    if someone could please help me to add the   theme correctly, that'd be greatly appreciated.
