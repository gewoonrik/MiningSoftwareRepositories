how to wrap a flash animation into a div?  i am trying to add a flash animation to my website.  i am using   2.3.2.    i added my flash animation inside my div with swfobject      div class="span12 fill"       object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="100%" height="100%" id="myflashcontent" style="visibility: visible;"           param name="movie" value="img/anime1.swf"           !--[if !ie] --               object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="img/anime1.swf" width="100%" height="100%"               !-- ![endif]--   a href=" "                               img src=" " alt="get adobe flash player"                           /a                !--[if !ie] --               /object           !-- ![endif]--       /object   /div       css     .fill {     min-height: 100%;     height: 100%; }      i added this . fill class  in order to get the full height. normally since this is    , it must have been set to full-height. but i couldn't get it.    normally it must be shown as this      however, the right side of the animation  overflows  to the right.         this is my animation url           this is my website url for demo purposes
