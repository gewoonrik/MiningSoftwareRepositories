Bootstrap tab: have unknown space between tabs  I am puzzled by the space between Bootstrap tabs in my particular case.    I am using Bootstrap 2.3.2 and Ace Theme (   .com/preview/WB0B30DGR ) for a web application.     Here is my HTML:      element for other reasons.     Let's assume no changes to my css and HTML. What additional CSS I can add to remove the space between tabs?    Thanks and regards!
