  tab: have unknown space between tabs  i am puzzled by the space between   tabs in my particular case.    i am using   2.3.2 and ace theme (   .com/preview/wb0b30dgr ) for a web application.     here is my html:          div           ul class="nav nav-tabs " id="my-tabs"             li  a href="#page-1" data-toggle="tab" 1 /a  /li             li  a href="#page-2" data-toggle="tab" 2 /a  /li              li  a href="#page-3" data-toggle="tab" 3 /a  /li            /ul       /div        div class="tab-content" id="my-panes"            div class="tab-pane" id="page-1"              tab 1          /div              div class="tab-pane" id="page-2"              tab 2          /div             div class="tab-pane" id="page-3"              tab 3          /div         /div       here is my additional css:     #my-tabs.nav-tabs   li {     display: inline-block;     float: none; }   #my-tabs.nav-tabs   li   a {     padding: 8px 16px;     margin:0; }      here is the jsfiddle demo:        there is space between tabs. i am puzzled by this. spend a few hours and unable to figure out why it is there. i want to remove the space between tabs.     please note that i have to use display: inline-block for   li   element for other reasons.     let's assume no changes to my css and html. what additional css i can add to remove the space between tabs?    thanks and regards!
