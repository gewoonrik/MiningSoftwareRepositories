  2.3.2 responsive design too slow in ie8   background     i've built a responsive website template. i've chosen to use    2.3.2  because it needs to work in ie7+ and be suitable for mobile devices. i've used respond.js and html5shiv.js so that it will work in ie.     problem     the site works beautifully in chrome and firefox. and it displays well in ie8. however  in ie8 it's incredibly slow . even after the page has finished loading the browser freezes up if i try to scroll down or click on something. it looks great but the slow response time makes it virtually unusable.     cause of problem     i've identified that   .min.css  is the cause. when i remove  .min.css from the page and leave everything else the same, the styles don't work but the page loads quickly and it's very quick to scroll up and down and click on buttons.    i think (or rather i hope!) that the cause is not   but rather because i'm using the  responsive  elements of   (e.g. row-fluid). i'd like to keep the site responsive for all non-ie users, but i'd like to try making all widths fixed for ie8 users and below.      attempts to fix     i've tried overriding the percentage widths in ie by creating a conditional ie stylesheet. however it doesn't appear to be possible to override the media queries, even using !important (example below).      html       div class="row-fluid"           div class="span10 width7"           /div   /div              this is an example of what i've been trying to override.      @media (min-width: 1200px)       .row-fluid .span10 {       width: 40.92827004219409%;       }       css to override       the code below is not able to override the   css above.     .row-fluid .span10.width7{         width:  485px !important;   }       question     has anyone got any suggestions about how i might adapt my template so that it continues to be responsive for non-ie users but has fixed widths for ie8 and below?    many thanks,    katie
