Bootstrap Multi-level dropdown pin the sub menu's on DOM  In Brief, I'm trying to use Bootstrap's Multilevel Dropdown feature.    Here we'r facing a issue like if you take mouse cursor out of drop-down menu or drop-down submenu then its getting hide by default. But i wanted to pin it even after mouse cursor goes out of drop-down menu or drop-down submenu.   it should get hide once i do click on DOM or any where on the page.    Here I'm attaching some reference of multi-level menu.     Bootply          If any one of us had something for this please share with me.     I found something similar to my requirement. But Its developed in Bootstrap v3. I need this in Bootstrap v2.3.2. Here is the  twitter- -multilevel-dropdown-menu
