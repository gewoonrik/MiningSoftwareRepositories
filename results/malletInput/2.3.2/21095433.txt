  modal sifting background page on open  i have a   modal (v 2.3.2) that opens with the following link:      a onclick="return false;" data-toggle="modal" class="openmodal" href="#mymodal" click me /a       and i expected that  onclick="return false;"  would prevent the background page from scrolling back to the top. but it stills jumps to top.  what else can i check or do to prevent the page from moving ?    i also tried adding an event handler  e.stoppropagation();  to the click event. i also tried adding  return false;  to the click handler and manually toggling the modal.
