glyphicons not applying to my i class  i can't get glyphicons to apply to my i class. not sure why. my code is:    my html is (reduced by 80% for test case):         however, the only style that's being applied is from my style.css        so i'm not sure how to even use the glyphicons at this point. i thought it'd be simple :/ not sure what i'm doing wrong. looked so easy.
