  datepicker from eternicode not selecting date  I'm working on this input right now using   3.0 and  -datepicker from eternicode.     The problem is that I'm having by default the input to be disabled, because I do not want the user to be modifying the date by his hand.    I'm assigning an input addon with a glyphicon of a calendar to show the datepicker. The problem though is that whenever I select a date, the input doesn't receive the date. I've been going through the docs and there's a way to do it, but it is with Bootstrap 2.3.2 only.     Here is my code, does anybody know how can I transfer the selected date from the datepicker into my disabled input?    Help will be much appreciated!     html          This is the link to eternicodes datepicker plugin:       -datepicker
