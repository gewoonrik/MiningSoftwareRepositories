Popover window from jQuery?  I am using a mixture of this map     and Bootstrap to create an effect where a graph appears in a Popover window corresponding to the state you hover over. The problem is, my javascript knowledge is limited at best. Is it possible to get that effect starting from the map on that page?    EDIT: Bit more info    Here's the code I've been using         No changes to the stylesheet. The popover should contain one of 51 js graphs I've created using xml.    Thanks.
