PHP Form builder class working with old version of  ?  I am using the php form builder class (   ) and jq validation (   )    So far I can succesfully combine these (even using some of the patterns php form builder class already built in) and I edited some of the element php files to change a pattern here and there, and to add some \n's to make a readable source code. (I still don't like my entire form on a single line in the source..)    But I would like to use different colours for the  . I've tried downloading several themed  .min.css files using paintstrapand twitter   themeroller    However, as soon as I include these instead of the standard netdna. cdn.com/twitter- /2.3.2/css/ -combined.min.css file, all my styling is lost and it looks the same as if there was no stylesheet included.      Since the php form builder class is relatively old, do I need to change all it's code to become compatible with the newer  , or is there a faster way to do this (perhaps a different form builder?)? Or am I messing up something else that is causing this change style options?
