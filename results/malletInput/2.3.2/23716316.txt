php form builder class working with old version of  ?  i am using the php form builder class (   ) and jq validation (   validation/ )    so far i can succesfully combine these (even using some of the patterns php form builder class already built in) and i edited some of the element php files to change a pattern here and there, and to add some \n's to make a readable source code. (i still don't like my entire form on a single line in the source..)    but i would like to use different colours for the  . i've tried downloading several themed  .min.css files using paintstrapand     themeroller    however, as soon as i include these instead of the standard netdna. cdn.com/ - /2.3.2/css/ -combined.min.css file, all my styling is lost and it looks the same as if there was no stylesheet included.      since the php form builder class is relatively old, do i need to change all it's code to become compatible with the newer  , or is there a faster way to do this (perhaps a different form builder?)? or am i messing up something else that is causing this change style options?
