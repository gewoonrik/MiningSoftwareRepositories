Bootstrap Collapsible navbar  I'm trying to create a collapsible navbar in Bootstrap 2.3.2. It breaks when I try to use it in mobile. The link to extend the list simply does nothing. I've check a bunch of people who seemed to have the same problem but their solutions are of no help. Here's my code         Anybody else have this issue and/or know how to fix it? I have  .min.css,  -reponsive.min.css, style.css,  .min.js, jquery.js all linked and in that order as well.
