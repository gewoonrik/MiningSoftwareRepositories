  collapsible navbar  i'm trying to create a collapsible navbar in   2.3.2. it breaks when i try to use it in mobile. the link to extend the list simply does nothing. i've check a bunch of people who seemed to have the same problem but their solutions are of no help. here's my code         anybody else have this issue and/or know how to fix it? i have  .min.css,  -reponsive.min.css, style.css,  .min.js, jquery.js all linked and in that order as well.
