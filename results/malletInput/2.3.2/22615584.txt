how to make the search form find the match from the category and then paste the value in a div  hi i am doing a quick search form, and i am using   2.3.2,    i use a dropdown menu on the lhs of the input field, and then a submit button on the rhs like this:      i want the user to select the category from the list first, and then when he/she type the keywords and submit, the search would be able to filter the label from the list, and then paste the match ones in the div below.    the js i am using is         but i could not figure out how to filter the result with the label selected.    could anyone help me with this? thanks,    the jsfiddle link is here:  link
