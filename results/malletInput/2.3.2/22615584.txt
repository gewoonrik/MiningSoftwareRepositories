how to make the search form find the match from the category and then paste the value in a div  Hi I am doing a quick search form, and I am using Bootstrap 2.3.2,    I use a dropdown menu on the lhs of the input field, and then a submit button on the rhs like this:      I want the user to select the category from the list first, and then when he/she type the keywords and submit, the search would be able to filter the label from the list, and then paste the match ones in the div below.    the js I am using is         but I could not figure out how to filter the result with the label selected.    Could anyone help me with this? Thanks,    the JsFiddle link is here:  Link
