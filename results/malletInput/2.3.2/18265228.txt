how to resize buttons and labels in   according to screen size  i am a beginner in css and  . i am using stable version 2.3.2 of  .    note : the only css files i include in my project are (in same order) -       .css   stickyfooter.css (for sticky footer at the bottom of page)   style.css (my custom overrides for some styling)    -responsive.css      all the responsive features of   framework work well except the   class.  they do not scale (smaller/larger) according to the screen size. any alternate way to achieve this?
