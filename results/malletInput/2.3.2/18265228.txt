How to resize buttons and labels in Bootstrap according to screen size  I am a beginner in css and  . I am using stable version 2.3.2 of Bootstrap.    Note : The only css files I include in my project are (in same order) -       .css   stickyfooter.css (for sticky footer at the bottom of page)   style.css (my custom overrides for some styling)    -responsive.css      All the responsive features of Bootstrap framework work well except the   class.  They do not scale (smaller/larger) according to the screen size. Any alternate way to achieve this?
