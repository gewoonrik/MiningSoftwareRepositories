Modal with tabindex="-1" gets focus on tab  I'm working with Twitter Bootstrap at the moment, and I'm encountering a strange problem in the tabindex of a modal:    I'm trying to tab through the form elements inside the modal, but after the last button the focus disappeared before coming back to the close button. I added a line in console that logs which element is being focused, and it turned out to be the modal itself, even though it has      (It also logs it when you click on the modal obviously, but that's out of scope).    Why does this happen? How can I prevent this? Is this a browser bug, a bug/feature of Twitter Bootstrap, or something else entirely?
