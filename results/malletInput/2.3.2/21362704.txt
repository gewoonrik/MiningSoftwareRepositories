Responsive Nav Horizontal to Stacked / Bootstrap 2  Are there classes in Bootstrap 2.3.2 for a horizontal nav, which at a certain breakpoint, becomes stacked?     I'm trying to avoid switching out classes on the parent with javascript.     I've looked all through the  docs , but no luck.    Thanks!
