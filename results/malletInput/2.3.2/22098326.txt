Bootstrap multiselect plugin not working dropdownlist not showing  I am using   2.3.2 with the multiselect plugin. I have the multiselect dropdown in a modal    multiselect is initiallized like:         The problem is when I open the modal the second time the button is visible but no dropdownlist, i have tried to replace above with multiselect.refresh   multiselect.rebuild. It seems a css issue or something.
