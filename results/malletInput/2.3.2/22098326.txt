  multiselect plugin not working dropdownlist not showing  i am using   2.3.2 with the multiselect plugin. i have the multiselect dropdown in a modal    multiselect is initiallized like:     $('.multiselect').multiselect({     includeselectalloption: true,     maxheight: 150,     buttonwidth: 250,  });      the first time round when the modal is first loaded it works fine - i can select the options from the dropdownlist. but when i close the modal (pressing the search submit button) i deselect all the options in the dropdown like this:     $('.multiselect').multiselect('deselect', $('.multiselect').val());      the problem is when i open the modal the second time the button is visible but no dropdownlist, i have tried to replace above with multiselect.refresh   multiselect.rebuild. it seems a css issue or something.
