Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 Nav collapse issue in responsive mode in chrome  I am using Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 for one of my apps. I noticed the following issue with the collapse responsive menu, It shows properly the first time you open it However when you try it a second time the menu shows blank. This only happens on Chrome mobile browser app on the Samsung Galaxy S3.    I have attached the images for the first and second time below
