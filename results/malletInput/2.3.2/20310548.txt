Bootstrap and   tag - event not firing first time- iPad only  We are using Twitter Bootstrap to pop up some modal windows and use some ajax calls. One problem we have run into concerns iPad devices.     We have this button:         When a purchase code is entered, we do a ajax lookup to see if the code is empty, malformed or otherwise valid. Our script.asp performs the lookup against a database and returns the appropriate code e.g. BADCODE in the case of a non-existent purchase code.    On iPad devices the click event does not fire until the button is clicked twice. On desktop browsers the code works perfectly. Is there a workaround, or is it a known bug? We have tried with BootStrap 2.3.1 and 2.3.2.
