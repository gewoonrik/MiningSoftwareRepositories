Bootstrap row elements not taking whole width  I am creating a webpage off of this    model . The problem I am facing, and what I cannot figure out, is why the two companies inside the  . At least, according to my understanding of the   scaffolding, they should be. (I may be mistaken). In any case, they are not taking up the whole width as I believe they should.     The CSS in the fiddle is copied straight from an uneditted   file. So the css should not be the problem (with version 3 coming out, I was having trouble pulling from the   server).     Also, the problem is not (I dont think) having a row within a row, because if you look at the   example page I provided, that is what they are doing and it is working for them :).    If it is unclear what I am asking, please ask questions and I will reply promptly!    Thanks
