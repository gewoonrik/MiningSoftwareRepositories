  row elements not taking whole width  i am creating a webpage off of this    model . the problem i am facing, and what i cannot figure out, is why the two companies inside the  . at least, according to my understanding of the   scaffolding, they should be. (i may be mistaken). in any case, they are not taking up the whole width as i believe they should.     the css in the fiddle is copied straight from an uneditted   file. so the css should not be the problem (with version 3 coming out, i was having trouble pulling from the   server).     also, the problem is not (i dont think) having a row within a row, because if you look at the   example page i provided, that is what they are doing and it is working for them :).    if it is unclear what i am asking, please ask questions and i will reply promptly!    thanks
