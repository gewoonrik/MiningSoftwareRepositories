  row elements not taking whole width  i am creating a webpage off of this    model . the problem i am facing, and what i cannot figure out, is why the two companies inside the  span10  class do not take up the entire row?    the easiest way to understand this would be to first look at this  fiddle . then, do an  inspect element  on the company row. notice that the  span10 div  is taking up the correct width (its going to the end of the page). however, the two  span5  divs inside of that should be taking up the entire width inside the  span10 . at least, according to my understanding of the   scaffolding, they should be. (i may be mistaken). in any case, they are not taking up the whole width as i believe they should.     the css in the fiddle is copied straight from an uneditted   file. so the css should not be the problem (with version 3 coming out, i was having trouble pulling from the   server).     also, the problem is not (i dont think) having a row within a row, because if you look at the   example page i provided, that is what they are doing and it is working for them :).    if it is unclear what i am asking, please ask questions and i will reply promptly!    thanks
