how to implement   2.3.3 dropdown  i'm following this:    .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#dropdowns     1) it says:  to keep urls intact, use the data-target attribute instead of href="#".  and then  href="/page.html" .  i assume  /page.html  refers to the page you're currently on.  is that true?  i'm using rails, and i have the dropdown code on a page that has a different url depending on what colleges page you're visiting.  so what would i put for the href then?  would it be easier to just forget it and just use  href="#" ?    2) it doesn't explain what to put inside here:          ul class="dropdown-menu" role="menu" aria-labelledby="dlabel"      ...    /ul        is it just the typical   li  a href="#"  /a  /li  ?
