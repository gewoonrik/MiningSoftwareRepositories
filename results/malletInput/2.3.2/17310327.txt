  tooltip hides selector/toggle element  i'm using   2.3.2.  my tooltips show up as expected, but when hovering off of the triggering element, the tooltip and the triggering element are both hidden.  there is an inline style of  display:none  being applied to the triggering element.    what is the best way to diagnose why this is happening? i fear it may be another js library conflicting, but i'm not sure how to capture the event that is adding  display:none  to the triggering element.
