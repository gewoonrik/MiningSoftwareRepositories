bower: installing legacy   (2.3.2) with bower  i have an open source webapp using   2.3.2 and which currently i can't move to   3 (completely different grid system) - i'm trying to move the webapp to use bower to handle dependencies but   but multiple different plugins (not concatenated) etc..    is this fixable? should i install differently?
