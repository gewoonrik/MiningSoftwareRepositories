bower: installing legacy   (2.3.2) with bower  i have an open source webapp using   2.3.2 and which currently i can't move to   3 (completely different grid system) - i'm trying to move the webapp to use bower to handle dependencies but  bower install  #2.3.2  fetches something that looks as the raw code repo not built, for example no css folder, just the seperate  less  files, no one minified   .min.js  but multiple different plugins (not concatenated) etc..    is this fixable? should i install differently?
