Angular Dialog directives with Bootstrap 3  We're trying to migrate from Bootstrap 2.3.2 to Bootstrap 3 (RC1) and are having problems with the  AngularJS Dialog directive . On clicking the relevant button no dialogue popup appears (the page appears black. Clicking anywhere returns to the original non-black view).     We're essentially using exactly the same code as in the above link.     There is a known issue discussed  here . In that discussion Luther suggests:         "to have modal worked, add hide class to set display:none to modal and reset the modal's display to block"       That unfortunately doesn't seem to make any difference. What alternatives could we use to get the dialogs appearing in Bootstrap 3 RC1?     I've tried using the  Modal directive instead . It has a similar problem where the page fades (rather than goes completely black) and the popup also doesn't appear.
