angular dialog directives with   3  we're trying to migrate from   2.3.2 to   3 (rc1) and are having problems with the  angularjs dialog directive . on clicking the relevant button no dialogue popup appears (the page appears black. clicking anywhere returns to the original non-black view).     we're essentially using exactly the same code as in the above link.     there is a known issue discussed  here . in that discussion luther suggests:         "to have modal worked, add hide class to set display:none to modal and reset the modal's display to block"       that unfortunately doesn't seem to make any difference. what alternatives could we use to get the dialogs appearing in   3 rc1?     i've tried using the  modal directive instead . it has a similar problem where the page fades (rather than goes completely black) and the popup also doesn't appear.
