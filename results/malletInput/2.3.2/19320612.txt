    2.3 - trying to make 5 vertically stacked elements total height always equal parent element  per the title, regardless of parent size (and still remain responsive) i've tried with other css examples but they contradict the tbs framework.  even tried making the parent a fixed height - i'm going in circles.    for desktop, i'm going for having the 5 stacked elements serve as navigation on right and having the main content on the left.  on the jsfiddle,you'll have to stretch out the html window some to see what i mean.    when i get down to phone, it gets replaced with something else so i'm not concerned about that.  i just want it responsive to a certain point.           thanks in advance
