typeahead with remote json  i have spent a few unproductive hours with the very painful lack of instructions for   (2.3.2) typeahead and have given up for the evening and hope some expert can point me in the right direction.    all the small tests i have fed into my base framework are ok so i know the basics are ok, but whenever i try to use my own feeds and variables it all implodes.. no thats not true.. it does nothing!    here is the live feed running on my dev webserver           and here is the attempt at code      html   head       title example /title       script src=" "  /script       script type="text/javascript" src="js/lib/ .min.js"  /script       script src="http:// .github.com/hogan.js/builds/2.0.0/hogan-2.0.0.js"  /script       link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/ .min.css"       link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/ -responsive.min.css"        script           $('#stations').typeahead([{             name: 'search',             valuekey: 'crs',             remote: {                 url: '                 filter: function (parsedresponse) {                     // parsedresponse is the array returned from your backend                     console.log(parsedresponse);                      // do whatever processing you need here                     return parsedresponse;                 }             },             template: [                 ' p class="station_name" {{station_name}} ({{crs}}) /p '             ].join(''),             engine: hogan         }]);       /script     /head   body   div class="hero-unit"       h1 input test /h1        input id="stations" autocomplete="off"/    /div   /body   /html       ultimately i want the name drop down list to have  name (crs)  with a value of the  crs  (i have not even looked into the assigning the value bit yet). please can anyone put me out of my misery. the end result in future will ideally read the json script from the page and assign to a localstorage area for usage, but for now just working will be awesome.    edit : just a clarification, this is open rail data for an open source datapage, and not commercial     extra edit : when i put this as the body but leaving everything else the same it works fine, so i know typeahead is working as a function       body        input id="stations" autocomplete="off"/        script           var jsonstring = '[{"label":"system administrator","value":"1"},{"label":"software tester","value":"3"},{"label":" software developer","value":"4"},{"label":"senior developer","value":"5"},{"label":"cloud developer","value":"6"},{"label":"wordpress designer","value":"7"}]';          var jsonobj = $.parsejson(jsonstring);         var sourcearr = [];          for (var i = 0; i   jsonobj.length; i++) {             sourcearr.push(jsonobj[i].label);         }          $("#stations").typeahead({             source: sourcearr         });       /script    /body
