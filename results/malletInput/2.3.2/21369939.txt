typeahead with remote json  i have spent a few unproductive hours with the very painful lack of instructions for   (2.3.2) typeahead and have given up for the evening and hope some expert can point me in the right direction.    all the small tests i have fed into my base framework are ok so i know the basics are ok, but whenever i try to use my own feeds and variables it all implodes.. no thats not true.. it does nothing!    here is the live feed running on my dev webserver
