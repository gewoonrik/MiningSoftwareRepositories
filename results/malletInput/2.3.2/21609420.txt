Bootstrap tab navigation using dropdown menu links  I'm trying to navigate through tabs in   2.3.2 using dropdown menu links and buttons.    I'm able to navigate to different tabs using links in the dropdown menu, however when I navigate back to the tab with the dropdown menu, the links in the dropdown seem to have been disabled.     Demo                             Any ideas as to why this is happening?
