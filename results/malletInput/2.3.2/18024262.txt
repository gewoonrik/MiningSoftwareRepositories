boostrap 2.3.2 carousel internet explorer images back to original size on transition  i have implemented a slideshow with   carousel. it works fine in chrome, but not on internet explorer.     when the images are sliding out of view, the image appears as the original size for a second. of course, when the browser window is sized very narrow, this becomes very disruptive.     you can take a look here:        for the carousel, i have html code:         could anybody help me figure out how to fix the internet explorer disruption?
