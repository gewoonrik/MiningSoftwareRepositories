creating a table row with different colored glyphicons  i'm new to programming, and am trying to create a "client list" example row for a table that has the "client" on the left hand side of the row, and "edit" and "delete" icons to the far right of the same row at a 960 width. i'm using   2.3.2 and am going to be propagating the list later with jquery. i can't figure out how to get the icons colored (or what the css is supposed to look like for the html).  here's what html i have so far:      html lang="en"   head       meta charset="utf-8"   title table /title    link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/reset.css"       link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/ .css"      link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/style.css"       link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/css/global.css"          link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico"      script src=" "  /script      script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/ .min.js"  /script      meta name="description" content=""    /head         body       table class="table"           tbody                   tr                       td hadley, bump  /td         td           i class="pull-right icon-trash"  /i           i class="pull-right icon-pencil"  /i         /td         /tr     /tbody    /table   /body    /html       thanks so much for your help!!
