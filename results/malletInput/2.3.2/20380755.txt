Creating a table row with different colored glyphicons  I'm new to programming, and am trying to create a "client list" example row for a table that has the "client" on the left hand side of the row, and "edit" and "delete" icons to the far right of the same row at a 960 width. I'm using   2.3.2 and am going to be propagating the list later with jquery. I can't figure out how to get the icons colored (or what the css is supposed to look like for the html).  Here's what html I have so far:         Thanks so much for your help!!
