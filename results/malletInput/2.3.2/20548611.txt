Create a full page width dropdown in Bootstrap 2.3.2  I am trying to get the dropdown menu in Bootstrap 2.3.2 to be full screen.    Here is a demo:        So when you click on a drop down area, the dropdown will be edge to edge single line but I can't quite figure out how to get there.    If I specify a certain width in px I can get it to work but means I get left to right scroll etc. and that is not ok ;-)    Any advice would be appreciated!
