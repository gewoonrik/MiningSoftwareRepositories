create a full page width dropdown in   2.3.2  i am trying to get the dropdown menu in   2.3.2 to be full screen.    here is a demo:        so when you click on a drop down area, the dropdown will be edge to edge single line but i can't quite figure out how to get there.    if i specify a certain width in px i can get it to work but means i get left to right scroll etc. and that is not ok ;-)    any advice would be appreciated!
