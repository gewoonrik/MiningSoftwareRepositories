  popover content html binding  i'm using     2.3.2, and the popover component.  the problem i'm having, is i have a form submit binding that fires on dom ready:         now when the popup shows, it displays the form correctly, but the 'submit' binding is no longer working.  it works on the form that is inside of the hidden div, but now on the content in the popover.  has anyone else seen this problem, and do you know how i can get the form in the popover to have the same binding applied?    thanks     edit     nevermind, i found it what was wrong.  the popover link was inside of a form tag, and when the content was bringing in a form, it was making a form within a form, a no-no.  it's working as it should now :)
