    and rails  im trying to put the     source files in my  rails  project but i am not seeing an  "assets"  folder in my app folder. are the image,  javascript , and  css  folders in "public" the same thing? if not then where do i put the source files? i am using ruby version 1.9.2-p290, rails version 3.0.19, and   version 2.3.2. not sure if that makes a difference or not.
