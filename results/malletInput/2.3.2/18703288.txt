collapsible navbar not working on mobile devices (2.3.2)  I am using twitter    ver. 2.3.2  and I have just realized that my  navbar  does not work properly if rendered on a mobile device.    The problem is the  sub-items  of each top menu do not redirect to the page specified in the url.    It works has expected if I resize my browser's window on a desktop computer.  I've tested it with an android phone (4.0.3), iPhone 4, and opera mobile emulator.      I've prepared a bootply  here  which can be rendered  here .      This is the HTML:         Any help will be appreciated.
