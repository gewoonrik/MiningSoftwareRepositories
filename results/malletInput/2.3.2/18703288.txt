collapsible navbar not working on mobile devices (2.3.2)  i am using      ver. 2.3.2  and i have just realized that my  navbar  does not work properly if rendered on a mobile device.    the problem is the  sub-items  of each top menu do not redirect to the page specified in the url.    it works has expected if i resize my browser's window on a desktop computer.  i've tested it with an android phone (4.0.3), iphone 4, and opera mobile emulator.      i've prepared a bootply  here  which can be rendered  here .      this is the html:         any help will be appreciated.
