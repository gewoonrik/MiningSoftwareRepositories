Bootstrap datepicker - two datepickers updating each others start/end dates  I'm using the  -datepicker widget from  eternicode .    I want two date pickers on my page, each updating the other;        Changing date1 should set the start date of date2.     Changing date2 should set the end date of date1.      Both dates should initially show today's date.      Here's what I have so far         but it's causing chrome and FF to crash if date1 is changed BEFORE date2.  If date2 is changed first then the code works as intended.    I could use some input on whether this is a bug in the plugin or in the way I've coded my implementation.    Here's a  fiddle  that doesn't actually crash the browser but it does hang for a second on selecting the first date.    I should mention that I'm using   3.  This plugin was intended for v2. Is this the problem?     [update] I tried a  fiddle  with   2.3.2 - same hang on date1 selection so I'm guessing it's not the   version.
