  datepicker - two datepickers updating each others start/end dates  i'm using the  -datepicker widget from  eternicode .    i want two date pickers on my page, each updating the other;        changing date1 should set the start date of date2.     changing date2 should set the end date of date1.      both dates should initially show today's date.      here's what i have so far         but it's causing chrome and ff to crash if date1 is changed before date2.  if date2 is changed first then the code works as intended.    i could use some input on whether this is a bug in the plugin or in the way i've coded my implementation.    here's a  fiddle  that doesn't actually crash the browser but it does hang for a second on selecting the first date.    i should mention that i'm using   3.  this plugin was intended for v2. is this the problem?     [update] i tried a  fiddle  with   2.3.2 - same hang on date1 selection so i'm guessing it's not the   version.
