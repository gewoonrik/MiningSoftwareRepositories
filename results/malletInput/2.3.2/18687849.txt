  datepicker - two datepickers updating each others start/end dates  i'm using the  -datepicker widget from  eternicode .    i want two date pickers on my page, each updating the other;        changing date1 should set the start date of date2.     changing date2 should set the end date of date1.      both dates should initially show today's date.      here's what i have so far     var month = ("january february march april may june july august september october november december").split(" "); var now = new date(); var nowformatted = now.getdate() + " " + month[now.getmonth()] + " " + now.getfullyear(); var dpoptions = {     format: 'dd mm yyyy',     startdate: now,     setdate: now, }; var datepicker1 = $("#date1").     val(nowformatted).     datepicker(dpoptions).     on('changedate', function (e) {             datepicker2.datepicker('setstartdate', e.date);             datepicker2.datepicker('update');     });  var datepicker2 = $("#date2").     val(nowformatted).     datepicker(dpoptions).     on('changedate', function (e) {             datepicker1.datepicker('setenddate', e.date);             datepicker1.datepicker('update');     });      but it's causing chrome and ff to crash if date1 is changed before date2.  if date2 is changed first then the code works as intended.    i could use some input on whether this is a bug in the plugin or in the way i've coded my implementation.    here's a  fiddle  that doesn't actually crash the browser but it does hang for a second on selecting the first date.    i should mention that i'm using   3.  this plugin was intended for v2. is this the problem?     [update] i tried a  fiddle  with   2.3.2 - same hang on date1 selection so i'm guessing it's not the   version.
