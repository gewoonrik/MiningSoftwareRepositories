    2.3.2 image in non-fluid grid  i am building a template with   2.3.2 and i want to have images that have certain dimensions according to the grid. (i'm not using the fluid grid, however i am using the responsive features).     i expect that the image which is contained e.g. in a  span4  div would shrink accordingly even if it has a larger resolution, but instead it is shown at its real pixel size. is there a way to shrink the image according to the div size? or do i have to apply an explicit width in the css?     i know that in plain css i could achieve what i want in this way:  image auto resize to fit div container  but i was wondering if in   there is a dedicated class for this.    here's my code:      div class="container"                 div class="row"                   div class="span12"                       div class="row"                           div class="span4"                               img class="img-polaroid" src="public/images/h1.jpg" alt="" /                           /div                           div class="span8"                               img class="img-polaroid" src="public/images/h2.jpg" /                           /div                       /div                   /div               /div   /div
