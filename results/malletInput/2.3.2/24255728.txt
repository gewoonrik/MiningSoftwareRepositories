wait until popover is destroyed?  i'm using     and i was wondering how i can wait until a popover is destroyed before showing another element?    here's the popover destroy call:     $('.first').popover('destroy');      i've tried doing the following, but it doesn't seem to actually make it to the second call:     $('.first').popover('destroy', function() {     $('.second').popover('show'); });
