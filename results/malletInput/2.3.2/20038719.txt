Bootstrap modal doesn't pop up when a node is clicked       I tried add myModal on the node attributes (mymodal is below code)  And attach .on('click') to make it something happen after node is clicked    But in this way my page became only 'hide fade'but they don't show inside  pages like here :       .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#modals     they only make it fade and nothing happens, how can I fix this problem? :)
