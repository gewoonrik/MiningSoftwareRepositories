Numeric Up and Down (Spinner Control) in Bootstrap 3  I tried to convert several numeric up and down (numeric spinner) control, but I couldn't. JQuery UI Spinner is not an option since I'm using   3, and I couldn't deploy the spinner from fuelx stand alone.    I found 2 or 3 similar but are them for   2.    After fighting with CSS, I found some guy here that could it, I make a fiddler with his answer but is stil doesn't work. Images doesn't show.    I think is some related with my version of font awesome on:          but I'm not sure. Any hint will be preciated.
