jquery.validationengine and     typeahead click event error  iâ´m using the lib. jquery.validationengine v2.6.1     and  -typeahead     .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#typeahead     my input text of form is:      input type="text" id="addproject" class="span2 typeaheadproject validate[required,funccall[hasproject]]" data-provide="typeahead" autocomplete="off" maxlength="200" /       the custom validation function works normally:     function hasproject(field, rules, i, options){     var found = jquery.grep(jsonoptions, function(obj) {         return obj === field.val();     });      if (found.length == 0)     {         return "the option was not found";     } }      the typeahed works normally:     $('.typeaheadproject').typeahead({ source: jsonoptions, items: 8 });      the problem:     when iâ´m typing the form, the validation script works normally if iâ´m use only the keyboard, like tab and down arrow to select a item on typeahead.    but if i use the mouse and to click in a item on typeahed, to complete my typing in text field, the validation will instanced (ahead of time) and it donâ´t work, because, the function  hasproject  will validate the initial typing, not the entire item was clicked.    iâ´m trying some methods to resolve, like:       using the updater method of typeahed to try "disable" the validation  momentarily.     using onchange, onblur event to validate again the field       both donâ´t work.    the closest solution, but is not ideal, is using the function below:     $('.typeaheadproject').typeahead({ source: jsonoptions, items: 8 }).change(function(){     var inputs = $(this).closest('form').find(':input');     inputs.eq( inputs.index(this)+ 1 ).focus(); });      but itâ´s is not good because its blink the invalidation message for 1 or 2 seconds, in the field, and when the focus go to next field, validation is performed again by removing the invalid message.    could you help me solve this problem? i believe that the ideal is not instantiating the validation when there is someone click on the item typeahead.    sorry for my english.    thanks for all
