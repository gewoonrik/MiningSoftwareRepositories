jQuery.validationEngine and twitter   typeahead click event error  I´m using the lib. jQuery.validationEngine v2.6.1     and Bootstrap-Typeahead     .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#typeahead     My input text of form is:         But it´s is not good because its blink the invalidation message for 1 or 2 seconds, in the field, and when the focus go to next field, validation is performed again by removing the invalid message.    Could you help me solve this problem? I believe that the ideal is not instantiating the validation when there is someone click on the item typeahead.    Sorry for my english.    Thanks for all
