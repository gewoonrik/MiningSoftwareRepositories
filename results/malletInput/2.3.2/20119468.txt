jquery.validationengine and     typeahead click event error  iâ´m using the lib. jquery.validationengine v2.6.1     and  -typeahead     .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#typeahead     my input text of form is:         but itâ´s is not good because its blink the invalidation message for 1 or 2 seconds, in the field, and when the focus go to next field, validation is performed again by removing the invalid message.    could you help me solve this problem? i believe that the ideal is not instantiating the validation when there is someone click on the item typeahead.    sorry for my english.    thanks for all
