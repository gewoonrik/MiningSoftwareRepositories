responsive css with      in my rails app, i'm using      . my footer is properly displayed on screens with landscape mode with width required enough.  here is how it looks:       but, on a browser on my android galaxy note, it appears broken. the footer appears correct if i use the browser in landscape mode, but in the portrait mode it breaks. it looks like:       here is my code:      div id="footer"     div class="container"       p class="muted credit" style="text-align: center"             copy; 2013  a href=" " websitename.com /a  all rights reserved.   |             a href="" title="privacy policy" privacy policy /a    |               %= link_to 'terms of service', terms_of_service_path %        /p     /div   /div       the css for the above is borrowed from  example - sticky-footer  :         html,   body {     height: 100%;     /* the html and body elements cannot have any padding or margin. */   }    /* wrapper for page content to push down footer */   #wrap {     min-height: 100%;     height: auto !important;     height: 100%;     width: 100%;     /* negative indent footer by it's height */     margin: 0 auto -60px;     position: fixed;     left:0;     top:0;   }    /* set the fixed height of the footer here */   #push,   #footer {     height: 60px;   }   #footer {     background-color: #f5f5f5;   }    /* lastly, apply responsive css fixes as necessary */   @media (max-width: 767px) {     #footer {       margin-left: -20px;       margin-right: -20px;       padding-left: 20px;       padding-right: 20px;     }   }    .container .credit {     margin: 20px 0;   }      i don't know why does it not render it correctly. i am new to the responsive css and i am learning. please let me know what's wrong.
