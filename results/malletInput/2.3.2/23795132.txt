how to make divs in   2.3.2. not break all at same width  my questions might be very easy but i have not been able to find any such hints here or in other places on the web.    what i am trying to do is to have several divs with content in one row (let's assume 6 for simplicity) but they should not all rearrange at the same browser width when scaling down.    so e.g. the example row has 6 divs at full width, when decreasing browser width they become two rows with 3 divs each, and only with very small width the become 6 x 1 div per row.    if have broken down the code into 2 divs of span6 and then included 3 divs of span4 each but they still all reshuffle at the same time.    i am using this code (the background color is only set to clearly differentiate the divs visually)        div class="row-fluid"       div class="span6"           div class="span4" style="background-color:#bbbbbb"              div 1          /div            div class="span4" style="background-color:#bbbbbb"              div 2          /div            div class="span4" style="background-color:#bbbbbb"              div 3          /div       /div         div class="span6"           div class="span4" style="background-color:#bbbbbb"              div 4          /div            div class="span4" style="background-color:#bbbbbb"              div 5          /div            div class="span4" style="background-color:#bbbbbb"              div 6          /div       /div   /div       any ideas are much appreciated.    thanks kai
