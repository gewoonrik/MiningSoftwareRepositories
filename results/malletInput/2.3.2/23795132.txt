How to make DIVs in Bootstrap 2.3.2. NOT break all at same width  My questions might be very easy but I have not been able to find any such hints here or in other places on the web.    What I am trying to do is to have several Divs with content in one row (let's assume 6 for simplicity) but they should NOT all rearrange at the same browser width when scaling down.    So e.g. the example row has 6 divs at full width, when decreasing browser width they become two rows with 3 Divs each, and only with very small width the become 6 x 1 Div per row.    If have broken down the code into 2 Divs of span6 and then included 3 Divs of Span4 each but they still all reshuffle at the same time.    I am using this code (the background color is only set to clearly differentiate the divs visually)         Any ideas are much appreciated.    Thanks Kai
