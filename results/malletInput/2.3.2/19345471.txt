header/data columns are not aligned with jquery datatables,   2.3.2 and horizontal scrolling enabled  enabling horizontal scrolling with datatables and using   2.3.2 causes the header and data columns alignment not to be synced - datatables use two separate tables to provide horizontal scrolling.    see this example: html:         here is the test case on jsfiddle,    , and the associated debug info        in this test case i've used datatables 1.9.4 with the latest datatables   css and js files (   /2 ). i've also tested with datatables 1.10 without any improvement.    ultimately i would like to also have "sscrollxinner": "150%" and fixedcolumns enabled but doing this just makes it much worse.    i've cross posted this to the datatables forum,        update 15/10/2013:    apparently the issue is down to a bug in chrome in the m30 branch that was introduced as part of an optimisation. a fix is now being circulated. see     see
