how to upgrade simple_form gem for   3  i updated my application by moving to   3 from version 2 by replacing the css files etc.     i thought i'd upgrade  simple_from  as well since the old one is probably incompatible with   2.    so i ran  bundle update simple_form  and it upgraded from simple_form (2.0.4) to  (2.1.1).     how do i upgrade to the lastest version? and how do i integrate it with   3? do i need to reinstall simple_form using  rails generate simple_form:install --   instead of updating the gem with bundler ? and how come updating the gem didn't update to the latest one?    thank you for the clarifications on how to migrate simple_form properly.
