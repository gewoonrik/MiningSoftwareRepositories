mobile view using    i've made a simple page as a sign in form to test mobile devices access.    live test is at:                 outside jsbin:                 if you try to open that url from a mobile device,  there is no way  one can get into the account and password forms.    i'm using a  very simple form  using          (v.2.0.4)  and works fine in any desktop, but why can't i access the form input's from a mobile device?   (iphone does not get into the form, android does not bring keyboard up)     what do i have to do more just to make it work on a mobile device without redo the hole site in a mobile framework?    i'm keep trying and trying, but no success so far and it's been several days now, i'm probably miss-seeing something simple and i hope the community could help clear my eyes :)
