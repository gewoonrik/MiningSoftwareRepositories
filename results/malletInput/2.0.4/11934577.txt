Mobile view using Bootstrap  I've made a simple page as a Sign In form to test mobile devices access.    Live test is at:                 outside jsbin:                 If you try to open that URL from a mobile device,  there is no way  one can get into the account and password forms.    I'm using a  very simple form  using   Twitter Bootstrap    (v.2.0.4)  and works fine in any desktop, but why can't I access the form input's from a mobile device?   (iPhone does not get into the form, Android does not bring keyboard up)     What do I have to do more just to make it work on a mobile device without redo the hole site in a Mobile framework?    I'm keep trying and trying, but no success so far and it's been several days now, I'm probably miss-seeing something simple and I hope the community could help clear my eyes :)
