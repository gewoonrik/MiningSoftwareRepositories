why isn't my   modal window working in opera?  i have a modal login window set up using the     framework, exactly as described at  http:// .github.com/ /javascript.html#modals  (using the markup method and using their demo modal window as a starting point). it works wonderfully on multiple browsers (which is one of the great reasons to use     in the first place).    however, when i test my page in opera, the modal window is not working. the page fades out like it should, but the window does not appear. why?    using:   v2.0.4, opera 12
