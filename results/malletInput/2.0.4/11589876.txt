Why isn't my Bootstrap modal window working in Opera?  I have a modal login window set up using the Twitter Bootstrap framework, exactly as described at    /javascript.html#modals  (using the Markup method and using their demo modal window as a starting point). It works wonderfully on multiple browsers (which is one of the great reasons to use  Bootstrap  in the first place).    However, when I test my page in Opera, the modal window is not working. The page fades out like it should, but the window does not appear. Why?    Using: Bootstrap v2.0.4, Opera 12
