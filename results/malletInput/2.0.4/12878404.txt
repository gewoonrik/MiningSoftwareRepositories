using image with brand  i'm trying to add a image with my gwt   application. i replaced the  widget with  widget however the  responsivenavbar  height is resized when using gwt image widget compared to using the brand widget.           ui:with field='res' type='com.mycomp.mygwt.client.resources'/        b:responsivenavbar position="top" scrollspy="false"   !--  inverse="true" --           !--  b:brand href="#" myapp /b:brand  --           g:image resource='{res.logo}'/       /b:responsivenavbar         is there any way to assign a image to brand using ui:with resource?    also, why in the gwt-  showcase, the  responsivenavbar  field  inverse="true"  is set, but when i use it in my application i get this error:     [error] [mygwt] - class responsivenavbar has no appropriate setinverse() method element  b:responsivenavbar inverse='true' position='top' scrollspy='false'  (:11)         i'm using gwt-  version:  2.0.4.0-snapshot
