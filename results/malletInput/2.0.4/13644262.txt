Bootstrap 2.2.1 modal bug - blue border around calling href?  I'm new here (and also with   and JavaScript) and hopefully im not asking a question already asked before. I did google plenty and search on here and could not find anyone mentioning this specific problem.    I found a bug I think with Bootstrap 2.2.1 .. when you close a modal, the href link which called it  now has a blue border around it . This happens with buttons, nav items, anything. This can be seen on the Bootstrap live demo itself - click the blue button "Launch demo modal" under the section "Modals  -modal.js". You can see a light blue border around the button after closing the modal.       /javascript.html#modals     This issue drove me mad, I messed with the CSS for ages, then tried different browsers, until I downgraded and the issue above is not present on   2.0.4.    Does anyone know if this is a known issue with 2.2.1 or has it been present since a particular version?, or what the problem is here?
