how to change the source property of typeahead in    ?  i'm using     2.0.4. i want to populate the dropdown using ajax. the source property of the typeahead plugin requires the value of source to be either an array  or a function. i tried changing the value of the array after the ajax request but it only displays the results of the first request.          the alert box shows the data loaded from ajax is correct but the dropdown still shows the previous values
