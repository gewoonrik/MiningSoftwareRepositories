twitter   overlapping borders of items  Using twitter- -2.0.4         My menuLeftItems are not aligned properly. Specifically the borders of those elements are overlapping. Please tell me how to properly align the elements. Also I want to each menuLeftItem to take the same width as its containing element span2. I tried width = 100% for .menuLeftItem. But it does not take effect.    My goal is to create a fixed page layout for different screen sizes. Hence I am trying to used fluid layouts.    Any help is appreciated
