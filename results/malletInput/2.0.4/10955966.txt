    overlapping borders of items  using  - -2.0.4         my menuleftitems are not aligned properly. specifically the borders of those elements are overlapping. please tell me how to properly align the elements. also i want to each menuleftitem to take the same width as its containing element span2. i tried width = 100% for .menuleftitem. but it does not take effect.    my goal is to create a fixed page layout for different screen sizes. hence i am trying to used fluid layouts.    any help is appreciated
