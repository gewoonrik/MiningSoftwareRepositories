    - list of widgets / panels that can scroll horizontally  what would be the ideal way to implement:       a list of widgets / panels . i am looking for widgets like in igoogle or  heft.me . a possible solution would be to use the css from the heft.me site, but i would like to know if there is a     way of doing it or are there any extensions available ?     once i achieve rendering widgets, i will be adding widgets dynamically. i would like these widgets to be horizontally scrollable. one possible solution is that i should tweak the carousel plugin that comes with  - , but again i would like to know if there is a better way ?     will it be advisable to maintain a list of horizontal scrolling widgets for smaller devices like mobile phones or is better to render them differently on mobile devices, may be accordion panels or something of that sort ?    btw i am using  -  2.0.4
