Twitter   - list of widgets / panels that can scroll horizontally  What would be the ideal way to implement:       A list of widgets / panels . I am looking for widgets like in iGoogle or  heft.me . A possible solution would be to use the css from the heft.me site, but I would like to know if there is a twitter   way of doing it or are there any extensions available ?     Once I achieve rendering widgets, I will be adding widgets dynamically. I would like these widgets to be horizontally scrollable. One possible solution is that I should tweak the carousel plugin that comes with twitter- , but again I would like to know if there is a better way ?     Will it be advisable to maintain a list of horizontal scrolling widgets for smaller devices like mobile phones or is better to render them differently on mobile devices, may be accordion panels or something of that sort ?    BTW I am using twitter-  2.0.4
