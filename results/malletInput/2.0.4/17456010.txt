changing navbar color in  's   2.3.2  i've looked at other posts addressing this question, but i still can't seem to able to change the background color the navbar in    . i'm using version 2.3.2. i did everything described by baptme in this post  change navbar color in     2.0.4  . here's the css i'm using to override the original  .css file.           the only thing that changes when i run this is that the active "home" link has the #c79810 background color. everything else still has the default black background color.    also, i really don't care about having a gradient unless it's required. just a solid background color is fine.    any ideas as to what i'm doing wrong? thanks!
