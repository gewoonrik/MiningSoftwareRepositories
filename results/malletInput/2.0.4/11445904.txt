Change Bootstrap 2.0.4 responsive navbar width  I'm creating a Site using Twitter Bootstrap 2.0.4 +  s responsive.css. What I don't know is: Is it possible to have a logo appearing at the top left of the site and the navbar appearing on the right of the logo (but fixed at top)? While changing Sizes, the Logo should then appear on top of the navbar.     Would be really nice to get an answer for I haven't found anything helpful yet.    Greetings, Dominik    edit: Here's a picture describing what I want to achieve:        Logo on the left, then navbar.
