  carousel v2.0.4 restarts on mouseleave event  jquery v 1.7.2,   v 2.0.4 (downloaded standard file from homepage this morning)      script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.js"  /script   script type="text/javascript" src="js/ .min.js"  /script   script $('#mycarousel').carousel({interval: false}) /script       i've seen lots of questions about this but  according to the official   blog  (items 5 and 10 under the heading 'javascript'), this issue was supposed to be resolved in v2.0.3.     i've added an interval false to the call, since this is supposed to (according to the docs) prevent it from sliding unless the user clicks the prev/next links.    at first this works fine: page loads, no sliding, user clicks next link, transitions nicely to the next slide. but if the user moves the mouse away from the container #mycarousel, then the sliding action starts automating again.     what's going on? i would really like the slide action to be under user control.
