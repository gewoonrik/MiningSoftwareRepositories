Grails Twitter Bootstrap with Google Maps  Im using Grails in the version 2.0.4 and have the following in my BuildConfig:         Now I can see the map, but the map is not going over the whole page. How can I say, that it should go over the whole page. I tried padding: 100%, but then it goes over the page, but much more and I can't see the end of the map.
