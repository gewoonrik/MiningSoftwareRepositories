div scroll does not fire in firefox  i have a div that on a scroll the jquery event does not fire. i've tried it as below as well as  $(".assignments-my-overflow") . it works fine in ie and similar code works in a stripped down example in firefox, but there is something in the js or css included in our website that causes it not to work in firefox. i am using     2.0.4 currently. i had looked for  preventdefault()  calls that might be blocking it but see nothing obvious. is there an easier way to figure out why it's not working other than to keep eliminating bits and pieces of css/js/html one at a time which is a little tedious ?      div id='assignments-my-overflow' style="height: %=percent% ; overflow:auto"   ...  $("div").on("scroll", function(){    // alert('scroll');    console.log("scroll");    $(".combo-input").hide();    $(".combo-input").show();        });
