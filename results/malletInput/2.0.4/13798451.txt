importing another css file from a css file under public asset does not work for play 2.0.4  i am pretty new to play and i am trying to use play 2.0.4 scala version with    . i also got a theme from wrap . the theme has certain customized css files which i put under public/stylesheets.    i end up with two css files under public/stylesheets: style.css and icons.css.  the style.css imports icons.css using @import url("icon.css").    so i thought everything should work if i just link style.css in my index.scala.html using:   but the play framework can not find icon.css.  i have to explicitly link icon.css inside index.scala.html with      i am not sure how play framwork takes care of the path issue for importing another css file inside of a css file under public assets.  i'd appreciate if somebody can shed some light on this.    best, james
