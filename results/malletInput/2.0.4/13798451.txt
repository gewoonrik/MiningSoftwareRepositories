importing another css file from a css file under public asset does not work for play 2.0.4  I am pretty new to play and I am trying to use play 2.0.4 scala version with twitter  . I also got a theme from wrap . The theme has certain customized css files which i put under public/stylesheets.    I end up with two css files under public/stylesheets: style.css and icons.css.

I'd appreciate if somebody can shed some light on this.    Best, James
