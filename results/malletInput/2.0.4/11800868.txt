    2.0.4 modal - how to apply modal fade in effect to a newly created modal class style?  i am learning web design by myself and now i've started playing with    's modal javascript plugin.    i've created a new modal class named modal-login, it's a login form inside a modal window. things have been working good, but the fade effect/slide down does not work. the effect that bring down the modal box from top to center.    i don't have yet deep understanding of javascript and jquery.    my question now is, can we edit the  -modal.js file, so that i may include my new modal class named modal-login and modal-register? so that it could take advantage of the modal fade in effect?
