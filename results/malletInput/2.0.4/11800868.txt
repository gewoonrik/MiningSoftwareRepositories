Twitter Bootstrap 2.0.4 Modal - How to apply modal fade in effect to a newly created modal class style?  I am learning Web Design by myself and now I've started playing with twitter  's modal JavaScript plugin.    I've created a new modal class named modal-login, it's a login form inside a modal window. Things have been working good, but the fade effect/slide down does not work. The effect that bring down the modal box from top to center.    I don't have yet deep understanding of javascript and jQuery.    My question now is, can we edit the  -modal.js file, so that I may include my new modal class named modal-login and modal-register? so that it could take advantage of the modal fade in effect?
