showing a google map in a modal created with      i'm trying to insert a google map into a modal using    . the modal shows up with the shape of the map present, but only part of the map is displayed, the rest is gray. upon resizing the screen the map always shows up correctly, although centered in the wrong place.    i've searched and found suggestions such as calling the map's resize event, or setting the max-width of the map image to none, but none of these suggestions have helped so far. it seems like the map is failing to figure out it's correct size as long as it's in an element that's hidden.     js     function initialize() {   var mapoptions = {     center: new google.maps.latlng(51.219987, 4.396237),     zoom: 12,     maptypeid: google.maps.maptypeid.roadmap   };   var map = new google.maps.map(document.getelementbyid("mapcanvas"),     mapoptions);   var marker = new google.maps.marker({     position: new google.maps.latlng(51.219987, 4.396237)   });   marker.setmap(map); }      html      div class="modal hide fade" id="mymodal"     div class="modal-header"       button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" ã— /button       h3  /h3     /div     div class="modal-body"       div id="mapcanvas" style="width: 500px; height: 400px"  /div     /div     div class="modal-footer"       a href="#" class="btn" data-dismiss="modal" close /a     /div   /div       i'm using     v2.0.4. i need some help because i'm failing to trigger the resize event correctly or editing the css so that the google map is left alone.
