fluid input-append in   responsive  i've been struggling to get an input with an input-append element to have the correct width in a fluid layout. i'm using v2.0.4 of  . as i resize to make the page smaller it breaks onto a newline. ideally i'd have the input the full width of the well (like the alerts). i've included the markup and some screenshots below. any help much appreciated!
