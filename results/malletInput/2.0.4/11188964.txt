Fluid input-append in Bootstrap Responsive  I've been struggling to get an input with an input-append element to have the correct width in a fluid layout. I'm using v2.0.4 of Bootstrap. As I resize to make the page smaller it breaks onto a newline. Ideally I'd have the input the full width of the well (like the alerts). I've included the markup and some screenshots below. Any help much appreciated!
