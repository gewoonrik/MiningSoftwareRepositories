rails delete not working inside     dropdown (2.1.0)  i just upgraded the gem less-rails-  to use     2.1.0, and it seems to have broken this code in my view, inside a   dropdown:      %= link_to 'logout', destroy_admin_user_session_path, :method =  :delete %       the server seems to think this is a get request instead of a delete. however, if i take that view code and put it immediately outside the dropdown, then it works great and the server recognizes the delete request.    if i change my gemfile as such:     gem 'less-rails- ', '~  2.0.4'      then run 'bundle update' and restart the server, then everything works as expected again. but if i simply have:     gem 'less-rails- '      then run 'bundle update' and restart the server, then the server thinks the delete is a get request.    i tried switching to the gem ' - -rails', and the exact same issue occurs. i assume i must be doing something wrong?
