Can I set the max-width for a responsive layout in twitter- ?  I just upgraded twitter-  from 2.0.4 to 2.2.1.  The only issue I have is that my current website now expands to the new  responsive layout  of 1170px and I've optimized my site around a max width of 940 pixels.  Does anyone know if it's possible to set the new responsive layout to have a max width of 940px?    My current meta tag looks like this:         Any thoughts?
