offset margin-left percentages for fluid row in    up to and including     v2.0.4, there have been no css margin-left percentages when using the offset class in a row-fluid scenario. i have looked on so and other sites for an answer but cannot find one.    does anyone have this information that i can add to my  -responsive.css file?    thanks,    chris
