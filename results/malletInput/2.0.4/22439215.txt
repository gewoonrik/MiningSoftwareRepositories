  carousel not scaling, ends up squishing images, same height    carousel images are squishing with the same height.  they are not scaling properly.  i have searched and tried several solutions, however, they have not solved my problem.  here is my html.      i tried adding adding links to several different css files.  i also tried adding several links to different js files.  i tried to change the height from 500px to auto.  i tried changing min-width 100% to width 100%.      i am using   3.0, however most of the solutions refer to earlier versions.  the solutions that referred to 3.0 did not work.  i just started learning bs.  i have a good working knowledge of html and css.  i believe that this has to do with js, but i cannot figure out my specific issue.  thank you in advance for any help.
