Second Font Awesome icon displaying on hover  In my navbar dropdown, when I hover over the links, the icons (icon-group, icon-plus) also have another icon (icon-filter) show up. This only happens on the   down down menu. I can't find any reference in the source file to the "icon-filter" class being applied.    You can view the incorrect icons in the dropdown at the link below.         Gemfile:
