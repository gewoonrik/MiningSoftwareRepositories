nav collapse not working with     - icon not appearing  im having the exact same problem as stated on this answered post -  nav-collapse not working [   ]     i apologize for being a newbie but i assume the answer here means that i should place:      link href="assets/css/ .css" rel="stylesheet"   link href="assets/css/ -responsive.css" rel="stylesheet"       in the head section of my application.html.erb file.      well, i've done this and the icon is still not appearing.  is there anything else i need to do?      here's my gemfile source:     source '  'rails', '3.2.8' gem 'bcrypt-ruby', '3.0.1' gem "possessive"    #gem 'therubyracer', :platforms =  :ruby gem ' -sass', '2.0.4'   # bundle edge rails instead: # gem 'rails', :git =  'git://github.com/rails/rails.git'  gem 'pg'  gem 'annotate', '2.5.0', group: :development   # gems used only for assets and not required # in production environments by default. group :assets do   gem 'sass-rails',   '~  3.2.3'   gem 'coffee-rails', '~  3.2.1'   gem 'uglifier', ' = 1.0.3'   gem 'jquery-ui-rails'    # see   for more supported runtimes  end  gem 'jquery-rails'  # to use activemodel has_secure_password # gem 'bcrypt-ruby', '~  3.0.0'  # to use jbuilder templates for json # gem 'jbuilder'  # use unicorn as the app server # gem 'unicorn'  # deploy with capistrano # gem 'capistrano'  # to use debugger # gem 'debugger'
