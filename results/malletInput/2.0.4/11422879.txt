outlook 2010 rendering differences?  my colleague and i both have outlook 2010 installed and we're using this with the microsoft dynamics crm outlook client. when we view the same crm web pages, we sometimes have web page rendering differences.    i know that outlook 2010 uses the ms word engine to render web pages, but what i don't understand is why his page layout breaks and mine not, while we both use the same version of outlook on windows 7.    for example, i created a custom web page with some button tags having images inside them. i used     for the css. recently i updated   to the 2.0.4 version where they added a new property to img elements saying 'max-width: 100%;'. his button images width reduced to 0 (or at least not visible anymore), and mine where still 16px wide or so and visible. how come?    what could cause these differences? please help.
