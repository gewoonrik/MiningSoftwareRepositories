 's   active buttons are not being applying any style  i have this rails application using  's   2.0 for styling, the problem is when i press a button on internet explorer, it becomes active and realizes the correct action... but the buttons remains with the same style so that's a problem    i'm developing on my mac, and trying out with a windows xp virtual machine with virtual box, the debug bar and the built in ie8 developer tools are so bad, and slow...but that's maybe because of the virtual machine and because i'm serving the app from my host computer and entering in the guest os like     (xxx... is for my ip)    what do you recommend me for this?    edit:    here's my definition for the html (html5 doctype) with haml     #categorias.row     .btn-group{ 'data-toggle' =  'buttons-checkbox' }       - categorias.each do |categoria|         .categoria{ :id =  "categoria_#{categoria.id}" }           %button.btn{ :id =  "categoria_#{categoria.id}_btn" }= categoria.nombre           - categoria.subcategorias.each do |subcategoria|             = hidden_field_tag "sub_categorias[#{subcategoria.id}]", "categoria-" + subcategoria.nombre.slugify, 'data-genero' =  subcategoria.genero      that's what it looks like in chrome         and the source         the ie 8 output         and the ie 8 computed css
