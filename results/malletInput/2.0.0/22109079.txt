  css not displaying with heroku  i followed  this  tutorial from heroku on how to create a static site with heroku. i followed the instructions exactly, but added  gem ' -sass'  to my gemfile. then i tried use  s grayscale template, but it does not display properly at all. you can view my project  here . it appears some of the css looks alright (color), but for the most part it is garbage.    the only eyebrow raising error i got when i ran  heroku logs  was this:     [2014-03-01 01:29:52] fatal signalexception: sigterm /app/vendor/ruby-2.0.0/lib/ruby/2.0.0/webrick/server.rb:170:in `block in start' /app/vendor/ruby-2.0.0/lib/ruby/2.0.0/webrick/server.rb:160:in `start' /app/vendor/ruby-2.0.0/lib/ruby/2.0.0/webrick/server.rb:170:in `select' /app/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.0.0/gems/rack-1.5.2/lib/rack/handler/webrick.rb:14:in `run' /app/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.0.0/gems/rack-1.5.2/lib/rack/server.rb:264:in `start' /app/vendor/ruby-2.0.0/lib/ruby/2.0.0/webrick/server.rb:32:in `start' /app/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.0.0/gems/rack-1.5.2/lib/rack/server.rb:141:in `start' /app/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.0.0/bin/rackup:23:in `load' [2014-03-01 01:29:52] info  going to shutdown ...
