can an open-source node.js project (mean stack) be licensed under the gplv3?  i want to start a simple open-source software project as a way to learn the mean stack, and i'm wondering if i can release the code on github under the gplv3.      mongodb (agpl v3)   express.js (mit)   angularjs (mit)   node.js (mit)      also   3 (apache 2.0 or mit?) and maybe jquery (mit). there's also the question of whatever gets installed into node_modules.    can a project like this be licensed under the gplv3? the mit license, apache 2.0 license, and agpl appear to be compatible with the gplv3, but i don't want to make a newbie mistake when i put it on github.
