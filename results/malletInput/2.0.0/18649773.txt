Can an open-source Node.js project (MEAN stack) be licensed under the GPLv3?  I want to start a simple open-source software project as a way to learn the MEAN stack, and I'm wondering if I can release the code on Github under the GPLv3.      MongoDB (AGPL v3)   Express.js (MIT)   AngularJS (MIT)   Node.js (MIT)      Also Bootstrap 3 (Apache 2.0 or MIT?) and maybe jQuery (MIT). There's also the question of whatever gets installed into node_modules.    Can a project like this be licensed under the GPLv3? The MIT License, Apache 2.0 License, and AGPL appear to be compatible with the GPLv3, but I don't want to make a newbie mistake when I put it on Github.
