very strange 'stack level too deep' problems on ' ' related gems  i've been stuck on this error for weeks.    when i trying to include   gems in my application.css file, it might give the error of "stack level too deep"    from what i googled pointed out the root issue of this was because of double defined method "image_url" both in sprockets and  -sass.    here's my error log:         now, i have updated  -sass to the latest version and the error gone for a while... next time i do "bundle install", the error poped up again. i also tried the different   gem: "anjlab- " the results are the same.    the strangest thing is:    i was trying to reproduce this error by creating a new empty rails app and use the same gemfile, as a matter of fact, i copied almost every files to the new projects includes "app", "config", "lib", "public", "gemfile" and "gemfile.lock"    and no error in the new project. i happily push the new project to github. next day, when i on my office computer, i git clone the new project, do the bundle install. and guess what.... the same error poped up again.    here my repo(the new and should be working) for the reference    git@github.com:jasonlu/drwho.git    i'm thinking the problem might be on my rvm. i have also tried to reinstall entire rvm and got no luck.    could anyone help?
