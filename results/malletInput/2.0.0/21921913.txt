updated rails gem  , heroku application error  recently updated by  _and_customization style sheet and the changes took effect locally, but when pushed to heroku they did not work. so i updated my gemfile to an updated  gem ' -sass', and pushed to heroku, but still didn't work. now i'm getting a heroku application error screen.
