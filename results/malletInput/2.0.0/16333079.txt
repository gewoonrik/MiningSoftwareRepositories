Twitter   problems with content being hidden under footer and navbar  beginner here. Currently using twitter  , along with my own html, css, and js. However, on some pages when content is a lot more than the actual page it seems to be hidden underneath the footer or the top navbar. I included a part of the site, and I have tried messing around with the margins or padding but it does become a problem when I reduce the size of the window as I am using the responsive mode.    Any help would be great thanks.         And using the twitter   css file and responsive css file.
