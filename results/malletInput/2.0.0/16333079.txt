    problems with content being hidden under footer and navbar  beginner here. currently using    , along with my own html, css, and js. however, on some pages when content is a lot more than the actual page it seems to be hidden underneath the footer or the top navbar. i included a part of the site, and i have tried messing around with the margins or padding but it does become a problem when i reduce the size of the window as i am using the responsive mode.    any help would be great thanks.         and using the     css file and responsive css file.
