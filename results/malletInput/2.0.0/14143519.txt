Most Javascript scripts don't work with    I have developed a site with   framework version 2.0  (I can't upgrade version b/c at the beginning I made the terrible mistake to change the  .css file, nevermind)    By the way, all   javascripts are ok! The are working great, But when I'm trying to insert a script from     Nothing working, or script is not working correct.     I thought at the beginning that maybe the script has problem, So I try to insert the same script on a blank html page  without   libraries. Result: It's working perfectly.    Why is that happening? Am I forgetting anything to add on html code? How can I made these scripts work in my .html and .php files?    I tried many scripts from this site and only 1 or 2 worked.      A not working script for example is:        Of course I'm using html 5. Is this a problem?
