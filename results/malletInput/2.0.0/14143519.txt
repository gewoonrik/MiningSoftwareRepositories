most javascript scripts don't work with    i have developed a site with   framework version 2.0  (i can't upgrade version b/c at the beginning i made the terrible mistake to change the  .css file, nevermind)    by the way, all   javascripts are ok! the are working great, but when i'm trying to insert a script from     nothing working, or script is not working correct.     i thought at the beginning that maybe the script has problem, so i try to insert the same script on a blank html page  without   libraries. result: it's working perfectly.    why is that happening? am i forgetting anything to add on html code? how can i made these scripts work in my .html and .php files?    i tried many scripts from this site and only 1 or 2 worked.      a not working script for example is:        of course i'm using html 5. is this a problem?
