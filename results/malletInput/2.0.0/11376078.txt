what is the ideal padding-top value for modern, responsive html5 layouts?      2.0 comes with a  padding-top  of  20px , which is mainly used to push down the container so that the navbar doesn't hide it, but if your site or app doesn't have a navbar at the top,  60px  isn't a one-size-fits-all value.  60px  is fine for 1280x1024 and higher layouts, but anything lower than  1024px  wide and it starts to look like a little too much blank space.    i'm guessing this value will also have to be responsive. these are all the media queries in    's responsive css:     @media (max-width: 480px) { ... } @media (max-width: 767px) { ... } @media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 979px) { ... } @media (max-width: 979px) { ... } @media (min-width: 980px) { ... } @media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }      what are the ideal padding values for each?     update:  how about 20px? it seems fine at 320x480 and not too shabby at 1920x1080 either.
