select2 and   not styling input field elements in rails  my input fields are not looking like they should, as per        not only is the   or select2 styling not applying to the input fields, i'm getting some funny duplicate behavior of the labels and forms here.    my unsubstantiated haunch is that   isn't being properly registered or communicating with select2.         app/views/characters/_form.html.haml      method to the proper dom element, but i'm simply not getting the styling that i should be getting.
