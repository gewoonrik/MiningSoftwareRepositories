  overrides with less using the  - -rails gem do not take effect?  i am trying to override variables in my  _and_overrides.css.less file, per the instructions in the file. i know the file is parsed because if i introduce a syntax error the application will not load, but setting less variables, e.g.         in a possibly related issue, i am unable to include glyphicons in my html.    edit: less variables are interpreted in production when i precompile and push to production (heroku). it appears that it may be an issue with development.
