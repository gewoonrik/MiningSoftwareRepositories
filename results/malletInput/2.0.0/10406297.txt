  2.0 activating tab and data by url within tab-content  i have seen numerous questions generally touching this subject, i know exactly what needs to be done but i'm not "fluent" with jquery therefore, i cannot successfully do this.       ul class="nav nav-pills" id="activate"       li  a href="#tab1" data-toggle="tab" tab 1 /a  /li       li class="active"  a href="#tab2" data-toggle="tab" tab 2 /a  /li    /ul     div class="tab-content"        div id="tab1"  h1 data for tab 1 /h2  /div        div id="tab2"            a href="#tab1" rel="taburl" data-toggle="tab" take me to tab content #1 /a        /div       ideally, the data of that tab is switched to #tab1, however, the tab will not switch to  active  class on the  href="#tab1"  (stays active on  #tab2  but displays the data from  #tab1 )    i figured i could use the  .first()  method and target the first occurrence of  href="#tab1  and  .addclass('active')  to this li. but i do not know how to select the li for anylink i link to it to directly target that  href  id    i really do not know if this can be done. can i inject the  href  data from the link (with jquery) then add it to the tab link and make it active.    and again, the  data-toggle="tab"  switches to the right content but will not update the active tab on the navbar,     so is there a way to select that exact 'tab' and  .addclass('active')  to the   li   once i've fired the link.    thank you for your time.    jsfiddle example
