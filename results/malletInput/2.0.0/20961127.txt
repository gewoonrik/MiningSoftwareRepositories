  3 navbar links display vertical when should be horizontal  following michael hartl's ruby on rails tutorial and after importing   into a custom.css.scss file the links display as a block (vertical) when they should really be horizontal causing the navbar to be really thick as shown below. so the question is what did i do wrong and how can i make the navigation horizontal using boostrap?         here's my application.html.erb layout
