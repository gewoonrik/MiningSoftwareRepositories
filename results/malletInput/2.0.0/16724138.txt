twitter-  icons do not appear in heroku  I am working on a Rails 4 application with ruby 2.0.0. I use twitter-  and I have a trouble with icon glyphs:    /base-css.html#icons  The problem is that these icons do not appear in production. In development environment, everything is ok.    This is my code in my help.html.erb file         My production environment is deployed on heroku. Do you have any idea why theses icons do not appear? Thanks for your help.
