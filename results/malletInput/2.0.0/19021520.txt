Simple_Form and Bootstrap 3 Form Validation Notification Stopped Working  I'm still learning RoR and have followed various tutorials online. In that process I believe I have messed up the nice flash notifications that Bootstrap 2 showed when validating Simple_Form submissions. I have tried to update my code, but without success. Here is what I have so far...    Running: Rails 3.2.13 Ruby 2.0.0    I just upgraded to Bootstrap 3 using this gem in my  gemfile :         I wish I knew what was going on but I really hope someone can help me get the formatting and flash messages back. Apologies if this is a total newbie question, but I feel a little lost and possibly regretting that I upgraded too soon to Bootstrap 3 maybe.    A thousand thanks in advance to anyone reading all this :)
