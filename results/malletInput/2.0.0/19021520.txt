simple_form and   3 form validation notification stopped working  i'm still learning ror and have followed various tutorials online. in that process i believe i have messed up the nice flash notifications that   2 showed when validating simple_form submissions. i have tried to update my code, but without success. here is what i have so far...    running: rails 3.2.13 ruby 2.0.0    i just upgraded to   3 using this gem in my  gemfile :     gem ' -sass-rails'      in my  application.html.erb  i have:      %= render 'layouts/messages' %       in my  _messages  partial i have:      % flash.each do |type, message| %     div class="alert  %=  _class_for(type) %  fade in"       button class="close" data-dismiss="alert" ã— /button       %= message %     /div   % end %       in my  application_helper.rb  i have:     def  _class_for flash_type     case flash_type       when :success         "alert-success"       when :error         "alert-error"       when :alert         "alert-block"       when :notice         "alert-info"       else         flash_type.to_s     end   end      in my  users_controller.rb  i have:     def update     respond_to do |format|       if @user.update_attributes(params[:user])         format.html { redirect_to @user, notice: 'account successfully updated.' }         format.json { head :no_content }       else         format.html { render action: "edit" }         format.json { render json: @user.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }       end     end   end      and in my  edit.html.erb  view i have:      %= simple_form_for(@user) do |f| %       %= f.input :firstname %       %= f.input :lastname %       %= f.input :email %       %= f.input :password %       %= f.input :password_confirmation %       %= f.submit "save changes", class: "btn btn-lg btn-primary" %   % end %       the validation works, but when returned to the edit view, no formatting (red for errors) or flash message appears. only a very hard to spot message outside each field is displayed. i must be missing some link between simple_form and   3, just don't know what.    i found another post where poster suggested to add:     config.input_class = "form-control"      to my simple_form initializer, but that gave me an error (think i might not have the latest version?):     undefined method `input_class=' for simpleform:module (nomethoderror)      i wish i knew what was going on but i really hope someone can help me get the formatting and flash messages back. apologies if this is a total newbie question, but i feel a little lost and possibly regretting that i upgraded too soon to   3 maybe.    a thousand thanks in advance to anyone reading all this :)
