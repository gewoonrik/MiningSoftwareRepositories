simple_form and   3 form validation notification stopped working  i'm still learning ror and have followed various tutorials online. in that process i believe i have messed up the nice flash notifications that   2 showed when validating simple_form submissions. i have tried to update my code, but without success. here is what i have so far...    running: rails 3.2.13 ruby 2.0.0    i just upgraded to   3 using this gem in my  gemfile :         i wish i knew what was going on but i really hope someone can help me get the formatting and flash messages back. apologies if this is a total newbie question, but i feel a little lost and possibly regretting that i upgraded too soon to   3 maybe.    a thousand thanks in advance to anyone reading all this :)
