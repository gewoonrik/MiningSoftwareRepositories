Twitter Bootstrap, show all popovers at one div  I tried to achieve the following using Twitter Bootstrap 2.0 and it's popover-plugin, but after a few hours, I still can't figure it out.    Let's just say, on the down-left corner of my page I got a picture showing a bird. This bird should "speak" every popover, for example the ones for a registration form, should appear on top of the bird. Is this possible?    For better understanding I created a test site  over here . If you hover over the registration fields, there are the popovers. I want them to appear over the bird-img in the down-left corner, but I don't know how to achieve this. It would be great if you could help me.
