   , show all popovers at one div  i tried to achieve the following using     2.0 and it's popover-plugin, but after a few hours, i still can't figure it out.    let's just say, on the down-left corner of my page i got a picture showing a bird. this bird should "speak" every popover, for example the ones for a registration form, should appear on top of the bird. is this possible?    for better understanding i created a test site  over here . if you hover over the registration fields, there are the popovers. i want them to appear over the bird-img in the down-left corner, but i don't know how to achieve this. it would be great if you could help me.
