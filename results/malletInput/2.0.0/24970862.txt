where is the  -sass color codes?  i'm using  -sass (3.2.0.0). i was following a tutorial and i used the following code in  app/assets/stylesheets/scaffolds.css.scss .     .timestamp {     color: $graylight; }      the result was an error indicating that undefied valuable $graylight. and i found  a link  says the naming has changed from $graylight to $gray-light.    i sought on the internet for the documentation regarding to the defined colors but i failed to found it. i think this kind of documentation should exist. totally no idea which color code can be used.    even i used  find . -type f -exec grep -h "gray-light" {} \;  there is no such file defines the color code.
