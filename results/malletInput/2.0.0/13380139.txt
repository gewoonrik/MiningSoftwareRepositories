    'hero' example 'jumps' when moving between 'home' and other navbar menu item  i have recently downloaded the tb 2.0 framework. i am using the 'hero' example as a starting point. i have added links to 'empty pages' for each of the menu items on the navbar menu.    by empty page, i mean essentially the same markup as for the hero page, but with the 'hero' part removed:         can anyone explain why when i move between the 'home' link (which displays the normal hero page) to an empty page link (i.e. any other menu item link), the page jumps, i.e. the navbar menu moves to the right when moving from home -> another menu, and back to the left when moving from another menu -> home.    why is this happening?     [[edit]]       my 'home' page is here:       an example 'other' page is here:
