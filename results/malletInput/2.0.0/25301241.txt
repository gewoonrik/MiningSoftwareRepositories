Bootstrap Navbar Stops Working After Clicking Link Only Works After Page Refresh  My Bootstrap nav bar works initially when loading the page. If you click one of the links on the navbar then when the page loads the new page the navbar will no longer work. It is rendering the navbar you just can not click any of the links and the drop down menus won't appear. I am running Rails 4 and ruby 2.0
