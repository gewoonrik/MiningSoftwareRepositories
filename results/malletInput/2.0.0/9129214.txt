CakePHP 2.0 with Twitter Bootstrap  Is there a way to configure CakePHP for it to work well with Twitter Bootstrap? I realize this question has already been asked  here , but the answer wasn't really complete.    There are also quite a few tutorials out there, but they are all either outdated or just not working, example:  Build a PHP application using CakePHP and (twitter) Bootstrap, Part 1 .    Thanks!
