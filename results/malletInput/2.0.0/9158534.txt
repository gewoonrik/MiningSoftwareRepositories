controlling carousel in     2.0  i'm testing out the new carousel feature in   2.0 and having difficulties making the nav arrows function correctly. the documentation is a little thin at the moment and i'm a newbie of sorts.     this is my html:         and that works. however the arrows don't move / cycle through the images when you click on them.     i'm sure it's something simple i'm missing. thanks for your help.
