Controlling Carousel in Twitter Bootstrap 2.0  I'm testing out the new carousel feature in   2.0 and having difficulties making the nav arrows function correctly. The documentation is a little thin at the moment and i'm a newbie of sorts.     This is my html:         and that works. However the arrows don't move / cycle through the images when you click on them.     I'm sure it's something simple i'm missing. Thanks for your help.
