How do I add a placeholder for vertical scrollbar with twitter   2.0?  In the earlier version of  Twitter Bootstrap  their was a placeholder for the vertical scrollbar so if the content didn't require one the page maintained it's layout.  If the page grew the scrollbar became enabled and didn't cause your pages content to shift to accommodate the scrollbar. Does anyone know how to accomplish this in TBS 2.0 or CSS?
