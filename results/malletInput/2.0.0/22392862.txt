undefined method `environment' for nil:NilClass when importing Bootstrap  I've been trying to import Bootstrap into my rails app and I'm not quite sure what's going wrong. I've had it working before, but I did a 'bundle update' and destroyed some dependencies (I think). I've seemingly fixed everything... except for Bootstrap.    I've tried removing and re-entering the ' -sass' gem... I can't really figure out where the error is.     Thanks for the help!    Gemfile
