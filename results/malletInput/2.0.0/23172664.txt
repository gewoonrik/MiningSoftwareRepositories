css not working - what's wrong with this code?  so, i wrote a node.js script for a cards against humanity clone which can be played in-browser.  here's the script that is started to run all the code:         could anyone point out what's wrong with any of this code? if you'd like to see any more of it for any reasons, just let me know.  basically, the whole webserver starts up fine, but when i navigate to the server on chrome, it doesn't show any css at all.  just plain text.    all the views and such on the frontend use  . thanks in advance.
