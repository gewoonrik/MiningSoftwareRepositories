Asp.net Button component doesn't work under Twitter-Bootstrap theme  I've been using twitter-  for my asp.net website theme and I've ran into some trouble when trying to make a simple button execute an event. The button is an asp component, from what I've read in the forums is that   doesn't manage quite well with asp.net components, either being a Script( most obvious ) or a CSS problem ( I don't know, I'm no expert on what's going on ).    As far as I've seen the button takes action when I place it inside a form, however it's not the action that should take place as far as I know.    And redirects to the same page but with these parameters:        ?ctl00%24MainContent%24LogUsernameText= ctl00%24MainContent%24LogPasswordText= ctl00%24MainContent%24loginBtn=Sign+In%21      I've tried many answers that I've seen in other people questions, such as making it render as a HTML button and make it      My guess is that theres some script redirecting my button event. I can't find it. I'm using the latest version of   theme.
