asp.net button component doesn't work under  -  theme  i've been using  -  for my asp.net website theme and i've ran into some trouble when trying to make a simple button execute an event. the button is an asp component, from what i've read in the forums is that   doesn't manage quite well with asp.net components, either being a script( most obvious ) or a css problem ( i don't know, i'm no expert on what's going on ).    as far as i've seen the button takes action when i place it inside a form, however it's not the action that should take place as far as i know.    and redirects to the same page but with these parameters:        ?ctl00%24maincontent%24logusernametext= ctl00%24maincontent%24logpasswordtext= ctl00%24maincontent%24loginbtn=sign+in%21      i've tried many answers that i've seen in other people questions, such as making it render as a html button and make it      my guess is that theres some script redirecting my button event. i can't find it. i'm using the latest version of   theme.
