Customize Bootstrap Dropdown Code for Nav Menu  I'm trying to modify the   dropdown JS code to add/remove a class to a div earlier in the code, as oppose to the parent li, which it currently uses as the target for the class toggling. My JS skills are admittedly not where I would like them to be, but I'm sure this is a pretty easy one for someone with a little more experience! I have setup a codepen as well as JSfiddle-- The goal is to toggle class 'open' to the div #navbar-container on clicking the dropdown li item 'products'
