getting rid of all the rounded corners in      i love     2.0 - i love how it's such a complete library... but i want to make a global modification for a very boxy-not-round site, which is to get rid of all the rounded corners in  ...     that's a lot of css to chug through. is there a global switch, or what would be the best way to find and replace all the rounded's?
