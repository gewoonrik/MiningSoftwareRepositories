image resize doesn't work in ie8 for   framework  i have been hacking and digging the google + stackoverflow, hope to find relevant solution that relate to my problem below but could not find one:    i am using   ( ) ver 2.0 and encountered that the image resize doesn't work on ie8 but work on other browsers.    the original code for image resize is:         it rendered so well in browser such as safari, firefox and google chrome but not ie8 (the only version i have on another desktop but reckon it should not work on all ie version)    please advice and desperate need to fix this ie nightmare     cheers
