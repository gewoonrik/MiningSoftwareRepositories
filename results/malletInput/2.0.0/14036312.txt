Image resize doesn't work in IE8 for   framework  I have been hacking and digging the google + stackoverflow, hope to find relevant solution that relate to my problem below but could not find one:    I am using   (twitter) ver 2.0 and encountered that the image resize doesn't work on IE8 but work on other browsers.    The original code for image resize is:         It rendered so well in browser such as Safari, Firefox and Google Chrome but not IE8 (the only version i have on another desktop but reckon it should not work on all IE version)    Please advice and desperate need to fix this IE nightmare     Cheers
