alerts/errors with     and ruby on rails  folks.    i'm using     to quickly build a small app with ruby on rails, and i seem to be having an issue with using the   -sass  gem.    i added the requisite line to my gemfile, and executed  bundle install .  the problem is...it doesn't seem to be putting the   css file that's needed inside  vendor/assets/stylesheets  that should be there.    so when i have this login (using devise), it's not showing proper style at all:         this erb:      % flash.each do |name, msg| %       % if msg.is_a?(string) %           div class="alert alert- %= name == :notice ? "success" : "error" % "             a class="close" data-dismiss="alert"  #215; /a             %= content_tag :div, msg, :id =  "flash_#{name}" %           /div       % end %   % end %       is generating the following html, which seems to be correct, according to the   documentation, which -should- be generating a   styled red-colored "error" alert box:      div class="alert alert-error"     a class="close" data-dismiss="alert"  #215; /a     div id="flash_alert" must be logged in to access the admin area. /div   /div       i am not sure what the problem is.  related information is as follows:      os:  ubuntu 12.04 lts (precise) x86 -- inside a vagrant vm ruby   version:  2.0.0-p247    rails version:  4.0.1
