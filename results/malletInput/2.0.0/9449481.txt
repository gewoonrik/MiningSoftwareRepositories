multiple inputs on a single line with     and simple form 2.0  i am using simple_form 2.0 with    .    i am trying to determine what is the proper wrapper format in order to get something like [city] [state] [zip]    i believe my form needs to be          i believe i would need to define the css as well, but before i go down a rabbit hole i thought i would ask if this is built in somewhere.
