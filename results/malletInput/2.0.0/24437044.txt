devise &   checkbox in ruby on rails: how to fix automatic setting of margin-left:-20px?  i'm working on stylizing the devise sign-in form (app/devise/sessions/new.html.erb) with   (using ruby 2.0.0 and rails 4.0), and have set the checkbox for "remember me" as such:         but for whatever reason, i think   keeps automatically setting it so the checkbox-inline has a margin-left of -20px, because it shows this when i examine the element using google chrome's developer tools. in the browser i can change this setting to 0px and it fixes the problem, but i have no idea how to actually do this in my rails application with either  's css.scss customization file or any other method.    does anyone know a possible fix for this? thank you to all in advance.
