Devise & Bootstrap checkbox in Ruby on Rails: how to fix automatic setting of margin-left:-20px?  I'm working on stylizing the Devise sign-in form (app/devise/sessions/new.html.erb) with Bootstrap (using Ruby 2.0.0 and Rails 4.0), and have set the checkbox for "Remember Me" as such:         But for whatever reason, I think Bootstrap keeps automatically setting it so the checkbox-inline has a margin-left of -20px, because it shows this when I examine the element using Google Chrome's developer tools. In the browser I can change this setting to 0px and it fixes the problem, but I have no idea how to actually do this in my Rails application with either Bootstrap's CSS.SCSS customization file or any other method.    Does anyone know a possible fix for this? Thank you to all in advance.
