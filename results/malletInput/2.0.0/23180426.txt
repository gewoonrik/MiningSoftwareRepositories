Upgrading Rails application to  3  Hi I have been following Michael Hartl's book for developing rails applications. I have reached the end and I want to start using Bootstrap3 with the app I've developed.    I have followed the instructions on    -sass  but this has not worked. The gem has installed correctly and I can get it to work on my local environment by changing my application.css --> application.css.scss and adding the import " " statement to the file along with having it in custom.css.scss. This doesn't seem right and it doesn't work when I deploy to Heroku either.    The set up I am trying to get work is as follows.    Gem file         and then refreshed the page.     Individually importing the css.scss files seems to have solved my problems
