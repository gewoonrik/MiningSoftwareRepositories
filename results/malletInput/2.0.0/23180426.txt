upgrading rails application to  3  hi i have been following michael hartl's book for developing rails applications. i have reached the end and i want to start using  3 with the app i've developed.    i have followed the instructions on    -sass  but this has not worked. the gem has installed correctly and i can get it to work on my local environment by changing my application.css --> application.css.scss and adding the import " " statement to the file along with having it in custom.css.scss. this doesn't seem right and it doesn't work when i deploy to heroku either.    the set up i am trying to get work is as follows.    gem file         and then refreshed the page.     individually importing the css.scss files seems to have solved my problems
