Extend div all the way to bottom without scrollbar  i've got a problem where I can't seem to extend a div all the way to the bottom. I've looked here on stackoverflow and found some topics about it and tried it out but it doesn't work 100%, it always creates a scrollbar also.    I'm using Twitter Bootstrap for my project btw.    HTML:          EDIT: I want the .footer vertically expanded Jsfiddle:
