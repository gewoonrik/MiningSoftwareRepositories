  popover not showing on top of all elements  i'm working on a   site and after updating to   2.2 from 2.0 everything worked except the popover.    the popovers still show up fine, but they don't show up on top of all other elements.       div  // this sits on top of the popover. this did not happen before cleaning up scripts.       div   //popover shows on top of this            div  //popover shows on top of this                //link here with popover in it.            /div        /div   /div       anyone have any idea on why the behavior of the popover changed, or how i can fix it? thanks.
