Exact same one-line SASS code works in one rails project, but not another  First of all this is my first time posting a question on StackOverflow. I'm a big fan. Anyway:    I was doing the Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl when, after editing the custom.scss.css file, I suddenly got this error:        SASS Syntax error        Undefined variable: "$gray".     (in /home/shady/workspace/ruby/sample_app/app/assets/stylesheets/custom.css.scss:4)      This isn't a problem with $gray; it is the correct way to spell and capitalize the gray SASS variable (I checked, and it works in another rails project). I simplified the custom.scss.css file to pinpoint this error, so all it contains is this:         This was working perfectly fine the last time I edited custom.scss.css, and I haven't done anything substantial since then. I haven't (at least purposefully) edited any file that I think would cause this. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling  -sass, but it hasn't worked. I believe it's a problem with SASS, but as I'm a rails newbie I have no clue on how to fix it. Any advice?
