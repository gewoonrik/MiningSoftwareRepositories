Owl carousel not displayed  I'm trying to use OwlCarousel version 2.0 together with Bootstrap 3 and Meteor.    I create a template for the carousel like this:         This code is largely copied from the documentation. Therefore, I would expect it to work. However, it simply displays nothing. The carousel seems to be the problem here, because when I remove the .owl-carousel class from the div, the elements are displayed (though not in a carousel of course).    Can anyone tell me why this is not working and how to get it working? I would really appreciate your help.    Thanks,    Tony
