owl carousel not displayed  i'm trying to use owlcarousel version 2.0 together with   3 and meteor.    i create a template for the carousel like this:      template name="featuredcarousel"   div class = "row"       div class="owl-carousel"           div class="item"  h4 1 /h4  /div           div class="item"  h4 2 /h4  /div           div class="item"  h4 3 /h4  /div       /div   /div   /template       i include this in my index.html file:      div class="container"      {{  featuredcarousel}}  /div       finally, i have a separate .js-file for instantiating the carousel:     $('.owl-carousel').owlcarousel({ loop:true });      this code is largely copied from the documentation. therefore, i would expect it to work. however, it simply displays nothing. the carousel seems to be the problem here, because when i remove the .owl-carousel class from the div, the elements are displayed (though not in a carousel of course).    can anyone tell me why this is not working and how to get it working? i would really appreciate your help.    thanks,    tony
