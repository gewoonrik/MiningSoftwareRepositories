owlcarousel2 - add item + update carousel  i've been having difficulty adding the owl carousel to our app, and was hoping that the latest 2.0.0-beta.2.4 version would be easier, but i am not able to just get the basic feature of adding an item and updating the carousel to work.    is there something i am doing wrong here?    here is the code i am using:     $('#insert').on('click', function () {     owl.trigger('add.owl.carousel', ' div class=\"item\"  p d /p  /div ').trigger('update.owl.carousel'); });      along with a demo:           the documentation (   ) doesn't seem to include anything - unless i'm missing something obvious.    any help would be appreciated.
