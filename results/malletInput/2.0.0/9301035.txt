how do i set up a dynamic tab with  -sass?  i am adding   to an existing project (rails 3.1).    here what i did:    added boostrap-sass to my gemfile:         i thought it would work out of the box.      [5] - what am i missing to make the dynamic table work with local content?     hope you can help,     joel
