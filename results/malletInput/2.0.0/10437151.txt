    modal on mobile devices    modals don't work correctly on android and ios.  the issue tracker acknowledges the problem but does not offer a working solution:     modals in 2.0 are broken on mobile.      modal window in 2.0 not positioning properly     the screen darkens but the modal itself is not visible in the viewport.  it's possible to find it at the top of the page.  the problem occurs when you've scrolled down on the page.    here is a relevant portion of  -responsive.css:         is there a fix i can apply?
