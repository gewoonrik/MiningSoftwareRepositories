Bootstrap Scrollspy stops working after an AJAX call added elements to the page  I am using the Bootstrap scrollspy plugin (v2.0.0) which works without a problem when the page loads first.    The navigation bar as well as the content sections get updated via ajax calls (add or remove menu items). After this scrollspy doesn't highlight the newly added items anymore.    How do I tell scrollspy to refresh? Or maybe attach scrollspy manually to the following code?
