formtastic check_boxes using collection not saving checked items in edit form  I know this was supposed to be fixed in Formtastic 2.0 but for some reason, this isn't working for me.           Whenever I go back and check it, the items is always unchecked again.  It never appears as selected.  I know Justin French commented about it  here , but I am not sure what it means or how that can help me fix the problem.      I am saving gender as a string in the User model if it makes a difference.     I am also using it with formtastic-  1.1.1    Thank you!
