How do I properly edit Twitter Bootstrap 2.0 with my rails app -Images overlapping & making jQuery Masonry work with it  Just wanted to add, this is on my local development machine   have been building a small social network more for fun   learning purposes.      I've searched   played around with this for awhile -I got the thumbnails working side by side by playing around with code on Jsfiddle, but have since lost the tab.    I've uploaded an image -         Have set up so users have galleries by uploading images (carrierwave)   the little boxes are on the bottom are off as well. Can anyone help me -currently, using;    Bootstrap Rails  htt ps://github.com/seyhunak/twitter- -rails   Bootstrap Sass    Also, wanting to add jQuery Masonry in there -but it hasn't really been working at all.    Thank You for reading   looking forward to your thoughts.
