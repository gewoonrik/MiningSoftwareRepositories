  typeahead.js process() populates list with undefineds  i seem to have the same problem as    typeahead ajax results undefined  but that has gone unsolved, so i am asking again, hopefully i can provide some missing details.    i am using the standalone typeahead 0.10.2 along with   2.3.1.  underscore is 1.6.0.  complete list of included libraries is:         my initial syntax came from some of the tutorials i had found via google which were probably using the old   version of the library (ex. from the one i linked to @ top of this post:  "then a simple array of names (['john smith','jane smith',...]) is passed to the process() callback." ).
