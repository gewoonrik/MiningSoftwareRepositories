Gitlab : File to import not found or unreadable:  /variables  I built a Gitlab server that worked perferctly just right before i installed and configured the "git-commit-nottifier" gem.     I edited the Gemfile, to make it work, but after the edit I destroyed the Gitlab web Interface. Now i get the error          I also added "sass-rails" or/and " -sass" outside the assets but nothing happened...
