jquery utter confusion with codekit  I'm following Ray Villalobos's advanced web development with   3 on Lynda.com and have followed the course to the letter. I've got to combining and minifying Javascript files with Codekit and its showing me 100's of errors which I have absolutely no clue about.Things like this        one of hundreds of errors:      if ( typeof module === "object"    typeof module.exports === "object" ) { 'module' is not defined. â€” column 47        Is it perhaps because I've downloaded the 2.1.1 jquery rather than the 2.0.0 version shown on the tutorial? Can someone please help - its so frustrating! I mean I could go through and fix most of the "expecting == and got =" sort of stuff but I just have no idea why I'm getting these errors and clearly theres something wrong
