how do i get a 16 column responsive layout with     2?  i'm getting mixed signals from various forum posts. does it exist natively by changing:         is that all i need to do to create a 16 column layout? i've seen some forum posts saying that you have to go hard-code in selectors span11-16 for it to work because those no longer exist since   2.0 and can't be dynamically created.
