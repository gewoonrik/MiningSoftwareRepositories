How do I get a 16 column responsive layout with Twitter Bootstrap 2?  I'm getting mixed signals from various forum posts. Does it exist natively by changing:         Is that all I need to do to create a 16 column layout? I've seen some forum posts saying that you have to go hard-code in selectors span11-16 for it to work because those no longer exist since Bootstrap 2.0 and can't be dynamically created.
