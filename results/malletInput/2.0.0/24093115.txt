how to set up datepicker vs 2013  can anyone please give me some specific steps to get a date picker working in  vs 2013 ?  from the package manager, i installed the package "  datepicker" 1.3.0.  now what?  i can't for the life of me find any documentation on what, exactly, i need to do to get this thing working.      after i installed the package, i dragged a reference to  -datepicker.js onto the head section of my page:         yet another auto-generated vs file.  not sure if this is kosher or not.    hopefully someone can spot something somewhere that somehow helps me zero in on the problem.  i keep harping on vs2013, because i have run across many problems with things that don't quite work in this version (without some tweaking), so i'm hoping someone has resolved a similar problem.  i just don't understand what the point of the 'package manager' is, if you still have to go through and hack all these files to make things work - shouldn't it resolve dependencies for you?    thanks in advance for wading through all this content.
