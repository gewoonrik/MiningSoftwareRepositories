how to set up datepicker vs 2013  can anyone please give me some specific steps to get a date picker working in  vs 2013 ?  from the package manager, i installed the package "  datepicker" 1.3.0.  now what?  i can't for the life of me find any documentation on what, exactly, i need to do to get this thing working.      after i installed the package, i dragged a reference to  -datepicker.js onto the head section of my page:      script src="../../../scripts/ -datepicker.js"  /script       i'm not sure if that's what i'm supposed to do or not).  vs 2013  has all these murky things going on with script bundling and whatnot and i have absolutely no clue how/if this process affects how i get a datepicker working.    for testing, i placed this control on my page:      input id="workdate" type="text" value="06-01-2014" class="dp" /       and i placed this in my page:     $(function () {   $('.dp').datepicker({format: 'mm-dd-yyyy'}); });      when i run the page, i get this error: "error: object doesn't support property or method 'datepicker'".  of course, i've googled this and found billions of postings, but i can't figure out what i'm supposed to do  in vs 2013 .  many of these talk about the order various things are loaded and frequently refer to vastly different versions of visual studio, etc.    it seems like jquery or jqueryui or whatever also has a datepicker of some sort.  i don't care if i use the   one or the jquery one, i just don't know what the procedure is for either one, or how to figure out if they're conflicting with each other, etc.  this really makes googling hard when i can't even figure out which datepicker people are referring to.    this is a web application project, i'm using master pages, ef 6.0, dynamic data, etc.  i have jquery 2.1.0 installed.     update:  ok, vs is just a fancy text editor, i get that, and i don't disagree entirely.  my problem is that when you create a web application with it, it creates dozens of files with references to things sprinkled all over the place.  when i'm told "just make sure your references are in the correct order" that's the exact thing i'm having trouble figuring out how to do.    here's some detail (i'll probably get chastised now for providing too much detail):     bundleconfig.cs  public class bundleconfig   {     public static void registerbundles(bundlecollection bundles)     {       bundles.add(new scriptbundle("~/bundles/webformsjs").include(         "~/scripts/webforms/webforms.js",         "~/scripts/webforms/webuivalidation.js",         "~/scripts/webforms/menustandards.js",         "~/scripts/webforms/focus.js",         "~/scripts/webforms/gridview.js",         "~/scripts/webforms/detailsview.js",         "~/scripts/webforms/treeview.js",         "~/scripts/webforms/webparts.js"));        bundles.add(new scriptbundle("~/bundles/msajaxjs").include(         "~/scripts/webforms/msajax/microsoftajax.js",         "~/scripts/webforms/msajax/microsoftajaxapplicationservices.js",         "~/scripts/webforms/msajax/microsoftajaxtimer.js",         "~/scripts/webforms/msajax/microsoftajaxwebforms.js"));        bundles.add(new scriptbundle("~/bundles/modernizr").include(         "~/scripts/modernizr-*"));        scriptmanager.scriptresourcemapping.adddefinition(         "respond",         new scriptresourcedefinition         {           path = "~/scripts/respond.min.js",           debugpath = "~/scripts/respond.js",         });        bundles.add(new stylebundle("~/stylesheets").includedirectory("~/content", "*.css"));     } }      i'm not gonna lie - i have no idea what's going on here, this file was generated by vs.  is this where i should be placing a reference to  -datepicker.js (rather than in the head of an individual page)?

    global.asax.cs  void application_start(object sender, eventargs e) {   // code that runs on application startup   routeconfig.registerroutes(routetable.routes);   bundleconfig.registerbundles(bundletable.bundles); }      nothing too interesting in this file, but this is where vs 2013 seems to differ from other versions - the way it does bundling seems to have changed or something.     packages.config   ?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?
