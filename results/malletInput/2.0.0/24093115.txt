How to set up Datepicker VS 2013  Can anyone please give me some specific steps to get a date picker working in  VS 2013 ?  From the package manager, I installed the package "Bootstrap Datepicker" 1.3.0.  Now what?  I can't for the life of me find any documentation on what, exactly, I need to do to get this thing working.      After I installed the package, I dragged a reference to  -datepicker.js onto the head section of my page:         Yet another auto-generated VS file.  Not sure if this is kosher or not.    Hopefully someone can spot something somewhere that somehow helps me zero in on the problem.  I keep harping on VS2013, because I have run across many problems with things that don't quite work in this version (without some tweaking), so I'm hoping someone has resolved a similar problem.  I just don't understand what the point of the 'package manager' is, if you still have to go through and hack all these files to make things work - shouldn't it resolve dependencies for you?    Thanks in advance for wading through all this content.
