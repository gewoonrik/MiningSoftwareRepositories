  text fields have suddenly shrunk  evening all,    i have a site which uses    , with the same css styles as a previous site so i am familiar with how things should look.    i ran bundle update, and suddenly all of the text fields, not areas, have shrunk in height, and no matter what css i code, i can't touch them. also the logo has drifted to the left of the page.     many similar questions suggest changing the doctype which i have tried to no avail.    css code for forms as follows;     input, textarea, select, .uneditable-input {   border: 1px solid #bbb;   width: 100%;   padding: 10px;   height: auto;   margin-bottom: 15px;   @include box_sizing; }      text fields being used as follows, which worked beforehand;      div class="control-group"           div class="controls"       %= f.text_field :song_name, placeholder: "please enter a song title..." %           br /       %= f.text_area :song, placeholder: "enter music score..." %           /div       /div       gemfile     gem 'rails', '3.2.3' gem 'jquery-rails' gem ' -sass', '2.0.0' gem 'bcrypt-ruby', '3.0.1' gem 'faker', '1.0.1' gem 'will_paginate', '3.0.3' gem ' -will_paginate', '0.0.5' gem 'pg', '0.12.2'  group :development, :test do   gem 'rspec-rails', '2.9.0' end   group :assets do   gem 'sass-rails',   '~  3.2.3'   gem 'coffee-rails', '~  3.2.1'   gem 'uglifier', ' = 1.0.3'   gem ' - -rails' end  group :test do   gem 'capybara', '1.1.2'   gem 'factory_girl_rails', '1.4.0' end  gem 'mysql2' gem 'omniauth-facebook', '1.4.0' gem 'koala'      if you need more code just ask, but any thoughts would be greatly appreciated! cheers andy
