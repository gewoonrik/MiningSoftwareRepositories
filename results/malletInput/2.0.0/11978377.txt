Bootstrap text fields have suddenly shrunk  Evening all,    I have a site which uses twitter  , with the same CSS styles as a previous site so i am familiar with how things should look.    I ran bundle update, and suddenly all of the text fields, not areas, have shrunk in height, and no matter what CSS i code, i can't touch them. Also the logo has drifted to the left of the page.     Many similar questions suggest changing the DOCTYPE which i have tried to no avail.    CSS code for forms as follows;         if you need more code just ask, but any thoughts would be greatly appreciated! Cheers Andy
