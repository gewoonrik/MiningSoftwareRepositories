 -  and forms in rails  this may be a beginners question but not having much luck getting this going.  the background:      rails 3.0.x version      2.0 - using as pre-compiled simply placed into public/stylesheets. att   attempting to do a form with horizontal layout, i.e. label next to the input field on the same line.      the issue is that i can't get the form to work, but can get the default   sample code, in the same form to layout correctly.  the rails form looks like:      div class="row-fluid"     div class="span4 well"       %= form_for @member, :html =  {:class =  "form-horizontal"} do |m| %           fieldset              %= m.label :title  %             %= m.text_field :title %                 %= m.label :first_name %             %= m.text_field :first_name %       % end %      /div   /div       notice that the  form_for  method has the class of  form-horizontal  as described by in  bootsrap form css     when displayed the label, for example title, is on one line left adjusted and then on the next line is the input field, also left adjusted.    now if i include some of the sample   code for forms such as:      div     form class="form-horizontal"       fieldset         legend legend text /legend         div class="control-group"           label class="control-label" for="input01" text input /label            div class="controls"             input type="text" class="input-xlarge" id="input01"              p class="help-block" supporting help text /p           /div         /div       /fieldset     /form   /div       then i get the expected outcome -- label and input field on the same line in horizontal layout.    i've tried adding the style "control-label" onto the m.label and m.text_field components but no joy in getting the layout as horizontal.    thus, not sure what the issue is, since the working part validates that i can get   to work, although with my rails form it's not honouring the form-horizontal.
