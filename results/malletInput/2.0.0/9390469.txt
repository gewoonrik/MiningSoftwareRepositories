Twitter-Bootstrap and Forms in Rails  This may be a beginners question but not having much luck getting this going.  The background:      Rails 3.0.x version    Bootstrap 2.0 - using as pre-compiled simply placed into public/stylesheets. Att   Attempting to do a form with horizontal layout, i.e. label next to the input field on the same line.      The issue is that I can't get the form to work, but can get the default Bootstrap sample code, in the same form to layout correctly.  The Rails form looks like:         Then I get the expected outcome -- label and input field on the same line in horizontal layout.    I've tried adding the style "control-label" onto the m.label and m.text_field components but no joy in getting the layout as horizontal.    Thus, not sure what the issue is, since the working part validates that I can get Bootstrap to work, although with my Rails Form it's not honouring the form-horizontal.
