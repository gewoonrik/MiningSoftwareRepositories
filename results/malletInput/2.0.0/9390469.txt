 -  and forms in rails  this may be a beginners question but not having much luck getting this going.  the background:      rails 3.0.x version      2.0 - using as pre-compiled simply placed into public/stylesheets. att   attempting to do a form with horizontal layout, i.e. label next to the input field on the same line.      the issue is that i can't get the form to work, but can get the default   sample code, in the same form to layout correctly.  the rails form looks like:         then i get the expected outcome -- label and input field on the same line in horizontal layout.    i've tried adding the style "control-label" onto the m.label and m.text_field components but no joy in getting the layout as horizontal.    thus, not sure what the issue is, since the working part validates that i can get   to work, although with my rails form it's not honouring the form-horizontal.
