JavaScript incompatibilities issues with IE8  I am using jQuery as well as twitter   for my site. I am using a scroll spy, A carousel and an AJAX form submit. I have tested these in three browsers. They work in chrome and FF but not in internet explorer.     Im new to the technologies so I may have missed something important for compatibility Below are the scripts im using.          Could someone possibly point out/ explain the errors of my ways     EDIT: I am using IE 8 to test this in.
