boostrap 2.0: adding a login form to a submenu, preventing close on focus  i'm using   2.0 to build a navbar, pretty similar to the example on their site. i have a submenu (.dropdown-menu) in which i've placed a login-form (username, password, submit).     everything renders just fine, but when i click the input fields for username or password the menu seems to think i clicked a menu item and the submenu is closed. any hints on how i can prevent this?    solution:     $('.dropdown form').on('click', function (e) {     e.stoppropagation() })
