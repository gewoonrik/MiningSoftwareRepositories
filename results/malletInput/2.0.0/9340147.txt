Boostrap 2.0: Adding a login form to a submenu, preventing close on focus  I'm using Bootstrap 2.0 to build a navbar, pretty similar to the example on their site. I have a submenu (.dropdown-menu) in which I've placed a login-form (username, password, submit).     Everything renders just fine, but when I click the input fields for username or password the menu seems to think I clicked a menu item and the submenu is closed. Any hints on how I can prevent this?    Solution:
