Making Select Boxes Glow Blue in Twitter Bootstrap  I'm using Twitter Bootstrap 2.0 and I was wondering how to change the select boxes so they have the same awesome blue glow that text boxes and other form elements do.      Right now all of the form elements I have is blue when focus is put on them, except the select boxes.  I noticed that even on     /base-css.html#forms  â€‹when I put my focus on the select boxes they glow orange, so maybe it's not built in yet.  Has anyone else had to deal with this, or know how to fix it?  Thank you!
