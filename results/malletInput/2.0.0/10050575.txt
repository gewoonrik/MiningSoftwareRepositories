Is it advised to combine: JSF 2.0 + Facelets + HTML5/CCS3/JavaScript?  I recently started developing a web application using JSF 2.0, however I'm new to web development and the field (even when limiting to JVM solutions) is turning out to be vast... the number of technologies to choose between is a bit overwhelming.    My concern/question is this, is it feasible/advised to mix/integrate the following technologies?      CCS3 + HTML5 + JavaScript (particularly, using Twitter Bootstrap framework)   JSF 2.0    Facelets      And if so, when working with a web designer what are the things that JSF 2.0 is going to make more difficult for me. For example, when integrating the web design into the application I guess I'll have to do some modifications: inserting JSF tags and EL expressions, deal with JavaScript in some special way(?), working through HTML tags incompatibilities(?), etc.    The following questions were helpful, but have not clarified everything:       What are the main disadvantages of Java Server Faces 2.0?     JSF/Facelets: why is it not a good idea to mix JSF/Facelets with HTML tags?     Is it possible to use JSF+Facelets with HTML 4/5?       Thanks in advance
