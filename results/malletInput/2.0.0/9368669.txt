getting started with less  i'm very new to web design...okay, now that that's out of the way, where do i declare variables in the less/css framework?    i'm using netbeans ide 7.0.1 i'm also using   2.0 (not sure if this matters). i downloaded the latest version of less from lesscss.org but it only downloads the minified version.    here are my links and script tags in the header:         can't wait to start assigning values to variables but i'm just not sure what file to do this in?    thanks all!
