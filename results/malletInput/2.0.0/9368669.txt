getting started with LESS  I'm very new to web design...okay, now that that's out of the way, where do I declare variables in the LESS/CSS framework?    I'm using NetBeans IDE 7.0.1 I'm also using Bootstrap 2.0 (not sure if this matters). I downloaded the latest version of LESS from lesscss.org but it only downloads the minified version.    Here are my links and script tags in the header:         Can't wait to start assigning values to variables but I'm just not sure what file to do this in?    Thanks all!
