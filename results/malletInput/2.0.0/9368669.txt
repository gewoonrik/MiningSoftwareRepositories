getting started with less  i'm very new to web design...okay, now that that's out of the way, where do i declare variables in the less/css framework?    i'm using netbeans ide 7.0.1 i'm also using   2.0 (not sure if this matters). i downloaded the latest version of less from lesscss.org but it only downloads the minified version.    here are my links and script tags in the header:      link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href=" /css/ .css"   link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/realcardio.css" media="all"   script type="text/javascript"src=" "  /script    script type="text/javascript" src=" "  /script   script type="text/javascript" src="js/main.js"  /script   script type="text/javascript" src=" /js/less-1.2.1.min.js"  /script       can't wait to start assigning values to variables but i'm just not sure what file to do this in?    thanks all!
