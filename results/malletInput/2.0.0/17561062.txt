    rails css not loading after cloning project on new machine  i have two machines, machine1 works just fine.  machine2 is a new    machine that i'm setting up.  machine1 is running osx 10.6 snow    leopard and machine2 is running osx 10.8 mountain lion.  i've    uploaded my project to github, so i should be able to (on machine2) install    xcode, homebrew, git, rvm, ruby, rails. then, clone project, bundle    install, rake, and voila, right?    nope, stylesheets aren't loading. there's no css styling so i check the browser,  application.css  shows this:
