    rails css not loading after cloning project on new machine  i have two machines, machine1 works just fine.  machine2 is a new    machine that i'm setting up.  machine1 is running osx 10.6 snow    leopard and machine2 is running osx 10.8 mountain lion.  i've    uploaded my project to github, so i should be able to (on machine2) install    xcode, homebrew, git, rvm, ruby, rails. then, clone project, bundle    install, rake, and voila, right?    nope, stylesheets aren't loading. there's no css styling so i check the browser,  application.css  shows this:     /*  * this is a manifest file that'll automatically include all the stylesheets available in this directory  * and any sub-directories. you're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at  * the top of the compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.  *= require_self  *= require  _and_overrides  *= require_tree    *= require jquery.ui.datepicker  *= require jquery.facebox */      am i forgetting something? i ran  rails generate  :install less  but still no dice. for some reason the application.css file isn't being interpreted.    i thought it might be an issue with the version of ruby because machine2 was using ruby 2.0 and machine1 ruby 1.9.2, so i installed 1.9.2 on machine2 but still nada.    this is all in development mode. also, in trying to troubleshoot the problem i included the   _and_overrides  stylesheet in the layout and then i had some styling! but that's obviously not the solution.    here's some configurations:     gemfile      source '  'rails', '3.2.3'  # bundle edge rails instead: # gem 'rails', :git =  'git://github.com/rails/rails.git'  gem 'mysql2'   # gems used only for assets and not required # in production environments by default. group :assets do   gem 'sass-rails',   '~  3.2.3'   gem 'coffee-rails', '~  3.2.1'   gem ' - -rails'   gem 'less-rails'   # see   for more supported runtimes   gem 'therubyracer', :platform =  :ruby   gem 'uglifier', ' = 1.0.3' end  gem 'jquery-rails'       development.rb      experts::application.configure do    config.cache_classes = false    config.whiny_nils = true    config.consider_all_requests_local       = true   config.action_controller.perform_caching = false    config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = false    config.active_support.deprecation = :log    config.action_dispatch.best_standards_support = :builtin    config.active_record.mass_assignment_sanitizer = :strict    config.active_record.auto_explain_threshold_in_seconds = 0.5    config.assets.compress = false    config.assets.debug = true end
