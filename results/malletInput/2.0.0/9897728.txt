how to use     with  -sass in rails app?  i'm quite new to this, but i cannot figure out the problem.    in     i would use :      div class="row-fluid"     div class="span2" column1 /div     div class="span6" column2 /div   /div       and it all works fine. but i do not want to write spanx and spany directly into my html file, rather i would like to give meaningful class names, for example:      div class="user-container"     div class="user-filter" first column /div     div class="user-list" second column /div   /div       given the fact, that i'm using    -sass , how should i write my scss file? i've tried the following, and it does not work (two columns are not displayed):     @import " "; @import " -responsive";  .user-container {     @extend .row-fluid; }  .user-filter {     @extend .span2; }  .user-list {     @extend .span10; }      if i look at the generated code, it seems to me that everything should be ok:     /* line 164, ../../../../../.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p125/gems/ -sass-2.0.0/vendor/assets/stylesheets/ /_mixins.scss */ .span2, .user-filter {   width: 140px; }      and so on.    what am i doing wrong?     update:     ok, just to be clear what is wrong - the columns are laid out as rows (one after another) rather like true columns (one next to each other), eg.:    with  : column1 column2  with my custom classes:  first column  second column      i've inspected the elements layout in chrome and it seems that   classes have float property, and mine - no. looking at css source i see classes like this:     [class*="span"] {   float: left;   margin-left: 20px; }      so in my case i think it should generate something like :     [class*="user-filter"] {       float: left;       margin-left: 20px;     }    or not?
