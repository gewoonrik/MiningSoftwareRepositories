How crucial is it that a Bootstrap tutorial be up to date?  I'm enjoying the Bootstrap tutorials  here , but after the first two, I realize that it's working off a V1 version of Bootstrap, where the layout worked as a 16-column grid and things like the span-one-third class were still active.     I know I could download and use an old version of Bootstrap, but (a) I'm not that smart, and (b) I'm trying to adopt best practices early on by using a github fork.    I'm not sure what else this tutorial will differ on. I can kind of figure out the differences between a 16- and a 12-column grid, but is there anything in Bootstrap between 1.4 and 2.0 that will completely screw me up while I follow these tutorials?
