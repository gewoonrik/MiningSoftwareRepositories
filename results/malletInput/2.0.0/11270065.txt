how crucial is it that a   tutorial be up to date?  i'm enjoying the   tutorials  here , but after the first two, i realize that it's working off a v1 version of  , where the layout worked as a 16-column grid and things like the span-one-third class were still active.     i know i could download and use an old version of  , but (a) i'm not that smart, and (b) i'm trying to adopt best practices early on by using a github fork.    i'm not sure what else this tutorial will differ on. i can kind of figure out the differences between a 16- and a 12-column grid, but is there anything in   between 1.4 and 2.0 that will completely screw me up while i follow these tutorials?
