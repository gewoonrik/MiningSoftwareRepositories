  alert dismissal not working, rails 3.2  using     2.0 with rails 3.2 (css files in assets/stylesheets, not using less or sass right now)    i have an   styled error or success alert at the top of my screen (based on whether first word of message == "error". i've added ' .js'   ' -alert.js' to the assets/javascript folder.    here is the code in my layout:      % flash.each do |name, msg| %     % if msg[0..4] == "error" %       div class="alert alert-error fade in"     % else %       div class="alert alert-success fade in"     % end %     a class="close" data-dismiss="alert" href="#"  times; /a     %= msg %   % end %       in my assets/javascripts/application.js i have:     $(".alert-message").alert() $(".alert-message").alert('close')      not sure i need both? tried with .alert / .alert-error as well.    nothing happens when i click the close symbol, i'm sure i'm missing something very obvious, but i'm new to using js /w rails, can't figure this out. in the chrome js console i see this error message, which seems to be about  -alert.js data-api:     uncaught typeerror: object [object object] has no method 'on'      many thanks for any tips!
