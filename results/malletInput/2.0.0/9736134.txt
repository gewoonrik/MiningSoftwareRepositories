  javascript at very end and jquery $(document).ready  much of jquery depends on  $(document).ready  ... why does   2.0 include the javascript library calls at the very end?     is there a way to get  $(document).ready  to work keeping the js lib calls at the very end?        update: a common example (and the source of my frustration!) is  $("#id").click() , which does not seem to work if you do not place it inside the  .ready  function...
