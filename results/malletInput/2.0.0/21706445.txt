Rails, Jcrop, Rmagick, Bootstrap - No Method Error  I've been beating my head against the keyboard for about a day over this one. I'm a bit of a noob, but I've done some research and can't seem to find the solution to this one.    I'm using Rails 4.0.2, Ruby 2.0.0p0, Bootstrap 2.3.2, Jcrop 0.9.12 , Rmagick 2.13.2    I'm trying to implement Jcrop in my app and keep getting the following error:         I'm completely stumped. Any assistance is greatly appreciated.
