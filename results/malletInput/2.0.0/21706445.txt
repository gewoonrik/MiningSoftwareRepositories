rails, jcrop, rmagick,   - no method error  i've been beating my head against the keyboard for about a day over this one. i'm a bit of a noob, but i've done some research and can't seem to find the solution to this one.    i'm using rails 4.0.2, ruby 2.0.0p0,   2.3.2, jcrop 0.9.12 , rmagick 2.13.2    i'm trying to implement jcrop in my app and keep getting the following error:     nomethoderror in peoplecontroller#update undefined method `crop_x' for # person:0x007fc7a531d160       i've looked at the  railscast  on implementing jcrop and it looks like i have things right.    i've also found some pages like  this one  that say there is a problem with a conflict between some css in jcrop and  . i tried adding the recommended code and that didn't fix it. so i looked at the jquery.jcrop.css file and noticed that the fix is already included so i removed it from my css file.     here is my photouploader.rb where i have the crop code. the line i've marked with ** is the code highlighted the error when the page tries to load:     def crop  **if model.crop_x.present?**    resize_to_limit(600, 600)    manipulate! do |img|     x = model.crop_x.to_i     y = model.crop_y.to_i     w = model.crop_w.to_i     h = model.crop_h.to_i     img.crop!(x, y, w, h)   end  end end      here is my controller for updating a record:     def update  respond_to do |format|   if @person.update(person_params)     if params[:person][:photo].present?       render :crop     else       redirect_to @person, notice: "successfully created person."     end     format.html { redirect_to @person, notice: 'person was successfully updated.' }     format.json { head :no_content }   else     format.html { render action: 'edit' }     format.json { render json: @person.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }   end  end end      here is my controller code with the strong parameters implemented:         def person_params   params.require(:person).permit(:fname, :mname, :lname, :company, :department, :title, :manager, :direct_report, :ntid, :work_phone, :mobile, :email, :office, :address, :city, :state, :zipcode, :country, :suite, :column, :fax, :assistant, :photo, :crop_x, :crop_y, :crop_w, :crop_h) end      here is the relevant code from my person model:     mount_uploader :photo, photouploader  after_update :crop_photo  def crop_photo   photo.recreate_versions! if crop_x.present? end      i'm completely stumped. any assistance is greatly appreciated.
