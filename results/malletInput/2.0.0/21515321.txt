typeahead.min.js github link not working  i implemented a search bar dropdown using   v3.0.0 and typeahead.js. at the time of completion of my project(2 months ago). i used the following to include the template engine and typeahead.min.js      link href="  .css/master/typeahead.js- .css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen"    script src="http:// .github.com/typeahead.js/releases/latest/typeahead.min.js"  /script     script src="http:// .github.io/typeahead.js/js/hogan-2.0.0.js"  /script       now all of a sudden i'm welcomed with a "there isn't a github page here." when i tried to access      http:// .github.com/typeahead.js/releases/latest/typeahead.min.js  http:// .github.io/typeahead.js/js/hogan-2.0.0.js      my search dropdown isn't working anymore. i tried to replace the hogan template link with a working link    /hogan.js/master/web/builds/2.0.0/hogan-2.0.0.js  but there are no alternatives for typeahead.min.js  here . infact there is not typeahead.min.js in any version. now they have changed it to      http:// .github.io/typeahead.js/releases/latest/typeahead.bundle.js       which doesn't work since it is upgraded version. any idea how i can find which version   i'm using. i'm really confused with what is happening and need your help. thanks.
