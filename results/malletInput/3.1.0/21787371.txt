Bootstrap3 ignores col-lg col-md and col-sm in IE8   Problem:  IE8 only takes in account my Grid layout with  col-x  classes. I have found a related / similar problem  IE8 issue with Twitter Bootstrap 3  wrt Respond.js and htm5shiv. I've tried all possible combinations, but IE8 still ignores my col-sm, col-md and col-lg classes (Media Tags?).    Here is my demo  HTML Code  which doesn't work:          I have verified that the JS and CSS files are loaded in IE8.  I'm using       Bootstrap 3.1.0   html5shiv 3.7.0   respond (latest version Feb/2014 - built 3fde2627484f8cb38e2bd4dbf2374cf41184b0f4)      What am I doing wrong? Why doesn't IE8 uses my col-lg col-md and col-sm classes?    Thanks!
