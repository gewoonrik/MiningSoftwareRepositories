resizing a slickgrid column header causes it to be misaligned with body  I am using SlickGrid 2.2 with Bootstrap 3.1.0 css.  When I try to resize the column header, the column header cell is not aligned with the cell in the body.  The header is consistently larger than the body whether I am shrinking or stretching it.  I am using the code from example 1:    html                In Bootstrap 2.3.2, the resizing seems to work as expected.    I have noticed a post about a similar issue at    .  There it seems to indicate that a rendering issue was fixed, however I believe my condition, where the item is resized, is still not working.
