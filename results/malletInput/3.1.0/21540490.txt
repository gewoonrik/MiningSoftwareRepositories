resizing a slickgrid column header causes it to be misaligned with body  i am using slickgrid 2.2 with   3.1.0 css.  when i try to resize the column header, the column header cell is not aligned with the cell in the body.  the header is consistently larger than the body whether i am shrinking or stretching it.  i am using the code from example 1:    html                in   2.3.2, the resizing seems to work as expected.    i have noticed a post about a similar issue at    .  there it seems to indicate that a rendering issue was fixed, however i believe my condition, where the item is resized, is still not working.
