How to correctly install Yeoman in Ubuntu 12.04?  In order to streamline my frontend-related workflows, am trying to use Yeoman to generate a blank project with frequently used packages, in particular the SASS-flavour of Bootstrap 3. I am running on Ubuntu 12.04.     I first installed Git via      Bower doesn't seem to be able to pull in jquery.git#~1.11.0 and  -sass.git#~3.1.0. The folder structure is properly set up on my localhost, but the relevant Javascript and Bootstrap-files are missing.    I would appreciate your advise how to fix this.
