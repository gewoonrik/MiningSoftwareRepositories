how to correctly install yeoman in ubuntu 12.04?  in order to streamline my frontend-related workflows, am trying to use yeoman to generate a blank project with frequently used packages, in particular the sass-flavour of   3. i am running on ubuntu 12.04.     i first installed git via      bower doesn't seem to be able to pull in jquery.git#~1.11.0 and  -sass.git#~3.1.0. the folder structure is properly set up on my localhost, but the relevant javascript and  -files are missing.    i would appreciate your advise how to fix this.
