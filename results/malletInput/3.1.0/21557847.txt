Slickgrid cell borders are clipped after setting box-sizing to use content-box  I am using slickgrid 2.2 and   3.1.0.  When I try to set a border around a cell, the cell below clips the border of the one above when I set the box-sizing: content-box.  The reason I seem to need that workaround (basically to fix a column width issue) is described at the end of this question.  Here is the code (using slickgrid's example 1 as the base):    css                As you can see, there should be a bottom border on the first cell, but it's being clipped by the one below.    Background:    In a previous question, I was trying to get to the root of the issue (I should not need to set the box-sizing explicitly since slickgrid seems to have already addressed the issue):     resizing a slickgrid column header causes it to be misaligned with body     Ideally, I'd like to know if Slickgrid is already fixed and I'm just using it wrong, However, it seems as though I may need to resign myself to setting box-sizing:content-box, which now brings me to the above question.
