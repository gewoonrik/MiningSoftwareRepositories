Bootstrap 3.2 - Show Collapsed Navigation for All Screen Sizes - Dropdown Menu Disappears  I'm using Bootstrap 3.2.0 and am trying to show the toggle button and collapsed navigation for all screen sizes. I added the custom CSS from this solution:     Bootstrap 3 - show collapsed navigation for all screen sizes     But unfortunately, immediately after the drop down menu appears, it disappears. The solution works for Bootstrap version 3.0.3, but with versions 3.1.0, 3.1.1 and 3.2.0, the menu immediately disappears.    You can see an example here:        I've tested all of the CSS styles, so I'm assuming that this is a   javascript issue. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
