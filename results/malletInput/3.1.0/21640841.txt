rails error messages break signup form  i'm following this tutorial:     and i have a problem with styles for error messages from rails.    i want to accomplish this:         but instead of that my form breaks and i get this ugly form:         i checked a source code and there are nov div tags inserted instead of label and input:         how to override that behavior and accomplish that form is only highlighted like in the tutorial?    thank you.     edit 1:     i found out where is the problem. i'm using   3.1.0 and extend is not working there. so, this is not working:     #error_explanation {   color: #f00;   ul {     list-style: none;     margin: 0 0 18px 0;   } }  .field_with_errors {   @extend .control-group;   @extend .error; }      and because of that this code doesn't work like it should:      % if @user.errors.any? %     div id="error_explanation"       div class="alert alert-error"        the form contains  %= pluralize(@user.errors.count, "error") % .      /div       ul       % @user.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %         li *  %= msg %  /li       % end %       /ul     /div   % end %       i can't find a way to make that extend working. like control-group is not present...     edit 2:     ok, when i add this code to  config/environment.rb  the form doesn't break but can't accomplish red lines around forms where is wrong input:     actionview::base.field_error_proc = proc.new do |html_tag, instance|   html_tag.html_safe
