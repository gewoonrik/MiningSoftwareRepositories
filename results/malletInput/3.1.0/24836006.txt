  css customizations and javascript not loading (ruby 1.9.3p547, rails 4.1.4)  i am building a basic ror application right now, but in both my development and production environments, i am unable to make customizations to the boostrap css, and the javascript isn't loading (it is however for my jw player on the homepage).  for instance, the dropdown function isn't working for the navbar, and the "destroy" function isn't working when i try to delete files.    here is my gemfile:          can anyone provide assistance with this problem?  i would greatly appreciate it.  as i mentioned in the header, i am running ruby 1.9.3 and rails 4.1.4.
