Bootstrap 3.1.0 dynamic added buttons has no margins  I'm having some trouble with dynamically added   buttons. The appended buttons don't get any margins.     I was able to recreate this by going to    .com/css/#buttons  and re-ordering the buttons with chrome dev tools (F12 in chrome).          Image below shows layout after I moved one of the buttons      I'm wondering what is causing the original nice layout and can I trigger a re-layout in some way?
