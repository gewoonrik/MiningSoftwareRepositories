  3.1.0 dynamic added buttons has no margins  i'm having some trouble with dynamically added   buttons. the appended buttons don't get any margins.     i was able to recreate this by going to    .com/css/#buttons  and re-ordering the buttons with chrome dev tools (f12 in chrome).          image below shows layout after i moved one of the buttons      i'm wondering what is causing the original nice layout and can i trigger a re-layout in some way?
