Tabs within tabs not working properly using   3  I am working on a webpage, where I plan to have to two menu tabs for one of the tabs on the Main-menu tab. I am able to get the Sub-menu tabs to show up on the page. The content gets populated properly for all the tabs. But, I am not able to navigate between the tabs. I am posting the code below of how I declared the tabs:     Header.php         I think I am messing up something with the tabs declaration. Can someone please let me know what am I doing wrong.
