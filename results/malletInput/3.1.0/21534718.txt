Bootstrap-3.1.0 bug in navbar from mobile devices?  On my site looks like I've found bug in   navbar when I visit it from mobile device or zoom+ in chrome browser. Here is screenshots:    100% - ok      zoom 150% - bug?      zoom 175% - ok again (same result had to be for 150% as well)      Is it bug? If so, how to fix it? I'm back-end developer, not front-end one, so I have some problems with it. Here the link for the site if that can helps -  socratify.ru     Thanks in advance!
