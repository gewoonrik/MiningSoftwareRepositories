font-awesome-rails not loading icons  i have this in my  gemfile :     gem 'rails', '4.1.0' gem "therubyracer" gem 'jquery-rails' gem ' -sass' gem 'sass-rails', '4.0.2' gem 'autoprefixer-rails' gem 'simple_form', '~  3.1.0.rc1' gem 'devise' gem 'geocoder' gem 'paperclip', '~  4.1' gem 'font-awesome-rails'      i've included this in  app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss      /*  * this is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files  * listed below.  *  * any css and scss file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,  * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.  *  * you're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the  * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.  *  *= require_self  *= require_tree .  */ @import "font-awesome"; @import " -sprockets"; @import " ";      i've then put this in my view:                %= fa_icon "camera-retro" %       in my browser, i can see the html rendered as such:      i class="fa fa-camera-retro"  /i       however, no icon displays.      i can also see font-awesome.css is loading here:         when i do:                %= fa_icon "camera-retro", text: "hello there camera" %       i get:         here's me adding text to the helper:    i'm sure i've missed something but what?
