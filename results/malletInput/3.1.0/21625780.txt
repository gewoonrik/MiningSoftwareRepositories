kendo ui   theme not working well with   3.1.0  i'm just in the process of converting a site based on   2.3 to 3.1 and i've got lots of issues with kendo's   theme.    i tend to use use   form-groups within custom grid popup editors, but they don't behave with kendo's css.    i've setup a  fiddle  to show the problem. as you can see when you edit a record, the sizing and positioning of the labels and input and way out.    it's something to do with the last two entries in the      if you remove these the   forms look correct, but certain kendo elements (such as the pager) are adversely affected.    is there a way around this or is this not how telerik intend for its framework to be used?
