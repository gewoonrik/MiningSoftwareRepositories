kendo ui   theme not working well with   3.1.0  i'm just in the process of converting a site based on   2.3 to 3.1 and i've got lots of issues with kendo's   theme.    i tend to use use   form-groups within custom grid popup editors, but they don't behave with kendo's css.    i've setup a  fiddle  to show the problem. as you can see when you edit a record, the sizing and positioning of the labels and input and way out.    it's something to do with the last two entries in the  common-template.less  file:     .k-animation-container, .k-widget, .k-widget *, .k-animation-container *, .k-widget *:before, .k-animation-container *:after {     .box-sizing(content-box); }  .k-button, .k-textbox, .k-autocomplete, div.k-window-content, .k-tabstrip   .k-content   .km-scroll-container, .k-block, .k-edit-cell .k-widget, .k-grid-edit-row .k-widget, .k-grid-edit-row .text-box, .km-actionsheet   li, .km-shim {     .box-sizing(border-box); }      if you remove these the   forms look correct, but certain kendo elements (such as the pager) are adversely affected.    is there a way around this or is this not how telerik intend for its framework to be used?
