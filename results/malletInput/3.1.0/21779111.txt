visual studio 2012 saying 'unable to edit' when including remote css file  i have included the cdn of the   css in my project. everything works absolutely fine, except when i type       div class="      then visual studio pops up an error saying:        unable to edit    '   cdn.com/ /3.1.0/css/ -theme.min.css '.    here`the style sheet must be part of the current project and the project must be a web site or web application project      i can hit ok to dismiss these errors, and then everything works fine as well - it reads the css classes and populates intellisense and works correctly when i build. but why is visual studio trying to edit the remote css file? how can i tell it not to?
