Visual Studio 2012 saying 'Unable to edit' when including remote CSS file  I have included the CDN of the   CSS in my project. Everything works absolutely fine, except when I type          Then Visual Studio pops up an error saying:        Unable to edit    '   cdn.com/ /3.1.0/css/ -theme.min.css '.    here`The style sheet must be part of the current project and the project must be a Web Site or Web Application project      I can hit OK to dismiss these errors, and then everything works fine as well - it reads the CSS classes and populates Intellisense and works correctly when I build. But why is Visual Studio trying to edit the remote CSS file? How can I tell it not to?
