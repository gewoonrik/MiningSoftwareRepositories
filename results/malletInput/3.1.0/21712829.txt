how to trigger multiple events when jquery is loaded  for a site i'm working on i want to load all js and css for   and jquery async and after it is loaded execute the jquery scripts on the page. currently i'm doing the loading with this script    .     my code for the loading process is this:        asyncloader(                         [                             '//netdna. cdn.com/font-awesome/4.0.3/css/font-awesome.css',                             '//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.1.0/css/ .min.css',                             'css/page_style.css',                             '//code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js'                         ],                         {                             'callback': function() {                                 $.getscript("//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.1.0/js/ .min.js");                                 $('#preloader').fadeout();                                 $("#js_ready").trigger("change");                             }                         }                 );      in the callback i trigger the change event on the js_ready div (a hidden element in my body) with jquery. the change event is caught by the following inline script which executes some jquery stuff.             document.getelementbyid('js_ready').onchange = function() {             $(".headline").find("h1").fadein("slow", function() {                 $(".headline").find("p").fadein("slow");             });         };      this works fine as long as i have only that one inline script. if i want to do some more jquery stuff after the loading process, in different spots of the page (dynamic generated scripts for example) it fails when i call the onchange listener again. i need something like the document ready function which gets triggered when all scripts are loaded. how can i do this with js?
