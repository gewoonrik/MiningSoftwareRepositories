how to prevent blur event before click event in     3.1 modal dialog when user clicks outside of it.!  i am using    3.1.0 and i have a modal.i want the modal to be hidden whenever user clicks outside the modal (so i have used  data-backdrop="true"  and is working fine.)    and my modal dialog has a focused input element having field validation and that input box will be focused whenever modal dialog is shown.on blur of that input box,validation takes place and throws error accordingly.(i want this logic to remain same).!!    my problem is whenever user clicks outside the modal dialog,it disappears showing a error message (field validation for input field).as blur event fired before click , it shows error message and then modal dialog disappears.    i dont want the field validation message to be displayed before hiding modal dialog.    please help ! thanks a ton in advance.
