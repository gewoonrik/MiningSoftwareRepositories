is there a loading pattern for using   with a npm project?  i have a npm project that uses jquery.     var $ = require('jquery');     i also have an index html file that references  .      link href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.1.0/css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet"/    script type="text/javascript" src="my-script.js"  /script   script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.0/jquery.min.js"  /script    script src="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.1.0/js/ .min.js"  /script       now do i need to a separate load for jquery for   as it depends on it?  i was recently using  jqueryify  instead of  jquery  and i did not need the separate load.    can anyone recommend a loading pattern for   with use with require?
