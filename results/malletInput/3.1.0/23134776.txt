  typeahead, knockout js, and     3 not playing nicely  i'm attempting to get the  knockout-   custom binding for typeahead jquery working with   3 so that i can use it with durandal 2.0, but it isn't working quite yet. the original binding is the following:      exception. i've attempted to create a  jsfiddle  for this, but it is not functional at the moment.     what am i missing to get   typeahead 0.10.2 jquery, knockout 3.1.0,   3.1.1, and durandal 2.0?
