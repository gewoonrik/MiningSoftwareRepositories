Twitter Typeahead, Knockout JS, and Twitter Bootstrap 3 not playing nicely  I'm attempting to get the  knockout-   custom binding for typeahead jQuery working with Bootstrap 3 so that I can use it with Durandal 2.0, but it isn't working quite yet. The original binding is the following:      exception. I've attempted to create a  jsFiddle  for this, but it is not functional at the moment.     What am I missing to get Twitter typeahead 0.10.2 jQuery, knockout 3.1.0, Bootstrap 3.1.1, and Durandal 2.0?
