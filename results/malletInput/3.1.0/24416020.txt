  menu non-visible on WP8 IE  I'm trying to make some menus on   v 3.1.0 and it works fine on my laptop, but on my nokia on the ie is not. I mean on mobile I don't have menu bar like I prepare, there's only black space in this part of site. Especially I made blue background, little transparent but on mobile is only black. I tried to fix colours but it's not working. When I small down my web browser on laptop there's "button" for menu, and it display after click on it. It seems like it work, but not on mobile. Where should I search to fix that bug? If it's needed I add here some codes.    Here are screenshots from mobile and laptop:  link
