  menu non-visible on wp8 ie  i'm trying to make some menus on   v 3.1.0 and it works fine on my laptop, but on my nokia on the ie is not. i mean on mobile i don't have menu bar like i prepare, there's only black space in this part of site. especially i made blue background, little transparent but on mobile is only black. i tried to fix colours but it's not working. when i small down my web browser on laptop there's "button" for menu, and it display after click on it. it seems like it work, but not on mobile. where should i search to fix that bug? if it's needed i add here some codes.    here are screenshots from mobile and laptop:  link
