  3.1.0 do not loading scripts?  i have a problem with my wordpress template built with use of   - scripts do not work, e.g. dropdown menu... i am sure that i'm doing everything right according to the instructions. but i do not know why my   want to load "assets" folder though in that version (3.1.0) there is no such folder.    location of my theme folder with   files in it looks like that:           my console says:     failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (not found)   -transition.js   -alert.js   -modal.js   -dropdown.js   -scrollspy.js   -tooltip.js   -tab.js   -popover.js   -button.js   -collapse.js   -typeahead.js   -carousel.js      in my style.css theme file i've got only information about author of theme and this line:  @import url('css/ .min.css');      in turn, my header.php file contains only:       link href=" ?php bloginfo('stylesheet_url');? " rel="stylesheet"
