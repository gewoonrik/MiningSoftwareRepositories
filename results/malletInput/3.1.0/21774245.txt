  3 less, apply styling only to a certain container  i want to include bootsrtap3 only into a certain container. what i did, i downloaded   sources, went to  \ -3.1.0\less  renamed   .less  to   2.less , created  bootsrap.less , added to it      .tw-bs {     @import " 2.less"; }      which i found in some answer on stackoverflow i don't remember now. and which should've enclosed every rule in  .tw-bs .    it worked for most rules, actually for all of them. but, when i looked closely at resulting  .css  files, i found some strange rules, like:      td.tw-bs .visible-print     or     .tw-bs .tw-bs .modal-footer:after     or     a.tw-bs .bg-primary:hover     that doesn't make sence, as  .tw-bs  should always be a parent. what i did wrong, and why this nonsence rules were generated?
