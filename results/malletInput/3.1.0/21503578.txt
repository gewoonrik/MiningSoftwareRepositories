  3.1.0 modal sizing not applied  after updating my   -sass  gem to  3.1.0  to take advantage of the new sizing options on modals ( .modal-lg  and  .modal-sm ), i've been unable to get the styling to be applied. my code is as follows:      div aria-hidden="false" aria-labeldby="ccmodallabel" class="modal fade in" id="ccmodal" role="dialog" style="display: block;"     div class="modal-dialog modal-sm"      ...content...    /div   /div       which, as far as i can tell, is nearly identical to  the example  in all the attributes that matter:      div class="modal fade bs-modal-sm" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="mysmallmodallabel" aria-hidden="true"     div class="modal-dialog modal-sm"       div class="modal-content"        ...      /div     /div   /div       however, upon inspection, the  modal-sm  class isn't been evaluated in my code as it is in the example, leading me to think that maybe it isn't included in the gem somehow, or am i missing something? the modal works in every other way aside the sizing.
