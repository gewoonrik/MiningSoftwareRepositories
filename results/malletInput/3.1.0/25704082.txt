  modal disappears immediately  I have a form on my website. When the submit button is activated I would like a   modal to appear and stay until you press the button on the modal to get back to the main menu.  The modal appears for a second and then disappears. When I press the 'back' button on my browser window the modal then appears and stays until I press the 'ok' button on the modal.  Any suggestions to a solution?
