  modal disappears immediately  i have a form on my website. when the submit button is activated i would like a   modal to appear and stay until you press the button on the modal to get back to the main menu.  the modal appears for a second and then disappears. when i press the 'back' button on my browser window the modal then appears and stays until i press the 'ok' button on the modal.  any suggestions to a solution?
