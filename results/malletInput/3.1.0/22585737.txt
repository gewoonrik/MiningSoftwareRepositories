cannot access $scope variables in controller - angularjs  i created an angular app that uses  . i based the project on a template that i downloaded and studied. i downloaded it from here:        i did not use or modify the template to create the project that i have now. instead, i created a new project and used nuget to download the latest packages for angular    .    the problem is in my 'contact' page, which has a form for site visitors to send me a message. i have defined a function - sendmessage - inside the controller which is bound by ng-click to a button in the html.     approot.controller('contactcontroller', ['$scope', '$http', function ($scope, $http) {     $scope.contactmodel = {};     $scope.sendmessage = function () {         alert('msg: ' + $scope.contactmodel.msgsubject);     } }]);   input type="text" id="msgsubject" name="msgsubject" data-ng-model="contactmodel.msgsubject" /   button class="btn btn-primary" ng-click="sendmessage()"  send message /button       the button and click event works fine but inside the function, it cant access the model variable. it returns with an 'undefined' - the alert says "msg: undefined"    i've researched this for three days now. i've looked at other demo code on plunkr and jsfiddle and i've seen it work but something in my setup prevents access to the scope variables (basically my defined model vars).    my angular app.js is:     var approot = angular.module('main', ['ngroute', 'ngresource']);   approot     .config(['$routeprovider', function ($routeprovider) {         $routeprovider             .when('/', { templateurl: '/main/home', controller: 'homecontroller' })             .when('/home', { templateurl: '/main/home', controller: 'homecontroller' })             .when('/contact', { templateurl: '/main/contact', controller: 'contactcontroller' })     }])     .controller('rootcontroller', ['$scope', '$route', '$routeparams', '$location', function ($scope, $route, $routeparams, $location) {         $scope.$on('$routechangesuccess', function (e, current, previous) {             $scope.activeviewpath = $location.path();         });     }]);      i've tested adding the variable when initializing the contactmodel variable:     $scope.contactmodel = { msgsubject: 'tst sub' };      the alert inside the 'sendmessage' function sees this and shows "msg: tst sub" correctly.    i've tried different configurations for the contactcontroller, including passing $location and $resource like so:     approot.controller('contactcontroller', function ($scope, $location, $resource) {  }      but still can't access the scope variables.    in all the samples   demos i've checked out - including the angular start tempate - the controller can access the defined ng-model variable. makes me think it has to be in my configuration or use of the differnt versions of either angular or  .    my _layout.cshtml defines the default controller and ng-app as so:      body data-ng-app="main" data-ng-controller="rootcontroller"style="background-color:transparent;"        angular version is v1.2.2 and   is v3.1.0    any help is apporeciated. thanks
