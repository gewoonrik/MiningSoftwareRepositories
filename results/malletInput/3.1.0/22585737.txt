cannot access $scope variables in controller - AngularJS  I created an Angular app that uses Bootstrap. I based the project on a template that I downloaded and studied. I downloaded it from here:        I did not use or modify the template to create the project that I have now. Instead, I created a new project and used Nuget to download the latest packages for Angular   Bootstrap.    The problem is in my 'Contact' page, which has a form for site visitors to send me a message. I have defined a function - sendMessage - inside the controller which is bound by ng-click to a button in the HTML.         Angular version is v1.2.2 and Bootstrap is v3.1.0    Any help is apporeciated. Thanks
