can i use the !important css keyword with angularjs ng-style directive?  i'm having an issue with  boostrap3  and it's  default background: transparent !important;  print setting.   i have the need to show a heatmap in my webapp and have these printable.  i'm using an ng-style directive for that to dynamically calculate the needed background-color.  in short, this is the html part      div class="heatmap" ng-style="scalecolor(10)" lorem ipsum /div       and this is the controller part     $scope.scalecolor = function(perc) {         return { backgroundcolor: plnkutils.scalecolorint('#ee0000', '#88ff00', perc) }     };      however, because  3 sets all backgrounds to transparent with the  !important  keyword, i can't print these.    this is the part of   3.1.0 css causing the issue with missing background-color:      @media print {   * {     color: #000 !important;     text-shadow: none !important;     background: transparent !important;     box-shadow: none !important;   } }      since the inverse of background: transparent !important; is  background: color hex code !important;  (see  here  ) i'm trying to set that using the ng-style, but then  the exclamantion mark causes angularjs to flip  when i try this:      $scope.scalecolor = function(perc) {     return { backgroundcolor: plnkutils.scalecolorint('#ee0000', '#88ff00', perc)  !important } };      or alternatively when i try this in the html template     ng-style="scalecolor(10) !important"        anyone out there that knows how i can use the !important css keyword with the angularjs ng-style directive to override the  3 wildcard?      for those who want to see this with their own eyes,   here's  a plunker showing the issue
