Can I use the !important css keyword with Angularjs ng-style directive?  I'm having an issue with  boostrap3  and it's  default background: transparent !important;  print setting.   I have the need to show a heatmap in my webapp and have these printable.  I'm using an ng-style directive for that to dynamically calculate the needed background-color.  In short, this is the html part           Anyone out there that knows how I can use the !important css keyword with the Angularjs ng-style directive to override the  3 wildcard?      For those who want to see this with their own eyes,   here's  a plunker showing the issue
