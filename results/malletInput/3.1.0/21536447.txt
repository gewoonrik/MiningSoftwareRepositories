why does ie 8 crash with  , knockout validation and custom binding handler when mouse out of parent?  ok.. this is a crazy bug that me and a colleague cannot figure out.  internet explorer 8 crashes (no console error message).  it happens when a knockout observable value is changed using a radio input with a custom binding (data-bind) and you move out of the parent dom container.  this error cannot be reproduced using internet explorer 9 in ie 8 browser mode - only a true standalone internet explorer 8 install will produce this error.     one thing that i did notice, is that if the knockout.validation library is not included the crash does not occur.     steps to reproduce:      copy / paste the code below to an new html file   open the newly created html file using a standalone version of internet explorer 8   click the yes or no button on the html page   move pointer outside of red border (this triggers the crash)      here is the code..
