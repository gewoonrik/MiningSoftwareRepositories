Why does IE 8 crash with  , knockout validation and custom binding handler when mouse out of parent?  Ok.. this is a crazy bug that me and a colleague cannot figure out.  Internet Explorer 8 crashes (no console error message).  It happens when a knockout observable value is changed using a radio input with a custom binding (data-bind) AND you move out of the parent DOM container.  This error CANNOT be reproduced using Internet Explorer 9 in IE 8 Browser Mode - only a true standalone Internet Explorer 8 install will produce this error.     One thing that I did notice, is that if the knockout.validation library is NOT included the crash does not occur.     Steps to reproduce:      Copy / paste the code below to an new html file   Open the newly created HTML file using a standalone version of Internet Explorer 8   Click the Yes or No button on the HTML page   Move pointer outside of red border (this triggers the crash)      Here is the code..
