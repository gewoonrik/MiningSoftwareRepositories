Bootstrap 3.1.0: affix too long  I am using  Bootstrap 3.1.0 . When an "affix" gets too long for the viewport, it gets cut off, never showing bottom items.    Is there a possibility to have Bootstrap's affix behave in a way that it is still possible for the user to scroll the complete affix from top to bottom?    Problematic example:            I hope my jsFiddle exemplifies this problem .
