  3.1.0: affix too long  i am using    3.1.0 . when an "affix" gets too long for the viewport, it gets cut off, never showing bottom items.    is there a possibility to have  's affix behave in a way that it is still possible for the user to scroll the complete affix from top to bottom?    problematic example:            i hope my jsfiddle exemplifies this problem .
