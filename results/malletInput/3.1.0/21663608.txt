How to I let the clicked nav-pill stays active using  ?  Below is how I created a menu links of my website using Bootstrap 3.1.0. I want the selected nag-pill to stay active/select while the link is clicked. Currently, the defined hover-colour is gone after the link is clicked. Is there a way to let the pill stay active after clicking?          ===Update===     I'm just new to JS and web development. The code that I'm trying to follow Twitter Bootstrap tutorial is here:        I just want the clicked nag-pill to show as 'selected' or 'highlighted' after user click on one of the pill/tab.
