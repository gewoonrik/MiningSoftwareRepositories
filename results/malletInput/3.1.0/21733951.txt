Bootstrap 3 Navbar toggle - collapses but button does not appear  I don't know what I'm doing wrong here but I expect it's something woefully stupid.    I'm using Bootstrap 3 in Umbraco 6.0.5 and I cannot get the toggle to work on resize down - below 770px width the nav collapses but there's no button to toggle it with, or rather something is there, as seen in code and Firebug, but not visible, in Chrome and Firefox (haven't tried IE).    There's a   fiddle   and the code below. I'm using    ,    cdn.com/ /3.0.3/js/ .min.js  and    cdn.com/ /3.1.0/css/ .min.css  in the fiddle.
