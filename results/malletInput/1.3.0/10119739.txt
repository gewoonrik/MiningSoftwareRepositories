Ruby on Rails deployment on Heroku -  -sass  I have quite problem with deploying on heroku. Really don't no why it doesn't work.      Here is my gem file:          On the heroku is still poor - We're sorry, but something went wrong.    Think that the problem is maybe with gem  -sass on heroku. I already tried switch to thin web server but it was total mess:( Can someone help me with this and maybe little bit describe the error. If some additional information will be needed, gonna post them immediately.Thank you...
