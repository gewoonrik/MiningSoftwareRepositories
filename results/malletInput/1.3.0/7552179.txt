Twitter Bootstrap.js Tabs says "ReferenceError: Can't find variable: $"  I am new to JS and find the whole paradigm quite confusing.    In trying to implement Twitter's Bootstrap.js library, I have tried to follow their instructions but have had absolutely no luck.    Basically, I want to use the tabs plugin. This is exactly my markup, and the JS console keeps saying: ReferenceError: Can't find variable: $    I gather that perhaps I am not loading jQuery here correctly, but... I don't know how I would do this any differently! Any assistance would be appreciated.
