   .js tabs says "referenceerror: can't find variable: $"  i am new to js and find the whole paradigm quite confusing.    in trying to implement  's  .js library, i have tried to follow their instructions but have had absolutely no luck.    basically, i want to use the tabs plugin. this is exactly my markup, and the js console keeps saying: referenceerror: can't find variable: $    i gather that perhaps i am not loading jquery here correctly, but... i don't know how i would do this any differently! any assistance would be appreciated.
