  not routing css or javascript? no route matches [get] "/css/ .css"    rails 4.1.1   ruby 2.0   webrick server      i am trying to get   -sass  working for the first time in development. i tried following the github instructions, the   website instructions and a couple of other videos that made it seem like i could install the gem, drag and drop the files, update the  application.css.scss  file and reference the css file in the application index page, call some css in the views and it would work.     i get an error when i check the source code of the page (which has the   reference i put in the  application.index.erb  file) to confirm that   is working. the code is there, but then i click the css link to confirm its working and get this:     no route matches [get] "/css/ .css"      here is my  application.css.scss  file:     /*  * this is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files  * listed below.  *  * any css and scss file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,  * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.  *  * you're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the  * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any styles  * defined in the other css/scss files in this directory. it is generally better to create a new  * file per style scope.  *  *= require_tree .  *= require_self  */  @import " -sprockets" @import " "      even though i'm in development mode, i set the production file to:       config.serve_static_assets = true      it's got to be some routing issue, but i cannot figure out why my asset pipeline isn't making the css and js available in development mode?    also, here is my gem file:     source '  bundle edge rails instead: gem 'rails', github: 'rails/rails' gem 'rails', '4.1.1' # use mysql as the database for active record gem 'mysql2' # use scss for stylesheets gem 'sass-rails', '~  4.0.3' #  -sass - latest version for web design (css and html layout) gem ' -sass', '~  3.2.0' # vendor prefixes gem 'autoprefixer-rails'  # turbolinks makes following links in your web application faster. read more:   'turbolinks'  # bundle exec rake doc:rails generates the api under doc/api. gem 'sdoc', '~  0.4.0',          group: :doc  # simple_form - forms made easy! top form generator on ruby-toolbox.com gem 'simple_form'  # windows does not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem gem 'tzinfo-data', platforms: [:mingw, :mswin, :x64_mingw]  # build json apis with ease. read more:   gem 'jbuilder', '~  2.0'  # use uglifier as compressor for javascript assets  gem 'uglifier', ' = 1.3.0'  # use coffeescript for .js.coffee assets and views  gem 'coffee-rails', '~  4.0.0'  # see   for more supported runtimes # gem 'therubyracer',  platforms: :ruby  # use jquery as the javascript library  gem 'jquery-rails'  # use activemodel has_secure_password # gem 'bcrypt', '~  3.1.7'  # use unicorn as the app server # gem 'unicorn'  # use capistrano for deployment # gem 'capistrano-rails', group: :development  # use debugger # gem 'debugger', group: [:development, :test]      [update]    here's the full error page [the url is:    .css# ]:     routing error no route matches [get] "/css/ .css"  rails.root: c:/users/kevin/desktop/sites/solar_permit  application trace | framework trace | full trace routes  routes match in priority from top to bottom  helper         http verb    path                         controller#action path / url           root_path            get            /                            projects#index projects_path    get            /projects(.:format)          projects#index                      post           /projects(.:format)          projects#create new_project_path     get            /projects/new(.:format)          projects#new edit_project_path    get            /projects/:id/edit(.:format)     projects#edit project_path     get            /projects/:id(.:format)          projects#show patch                           /projects/:id(.:format)          projects#update put                                 /projects/:id(.:format)          projects#update delete                          /projects/:id(.:format)          projects#destroy get|post            /:controller(/:action(/:id))(.:format)          :controller#:action      here is the application layout file:      !doctype html   html   head     title solarpermit /title    link href="/css/ .css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen"   /head   body    script src=" "  /script       script src="js/ .js"  /script   div class="container"       ul class="nav nav-tabs"           li  %= link_to "home", root_path %  /li       /ul   %= yield %   /div    /body   /html
