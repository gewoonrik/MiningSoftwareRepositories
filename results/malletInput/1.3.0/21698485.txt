Bootstrap Bootsnipp snippet won't render correctly  I'm trying to use a Bootsnipp snippet in my page. Namely,  collapsible-tree-menu-with-accordion . However the entire thing is being rendered in a 'flat' way. The collapse/expand mechanism is working fine, but the list items are not indented, nor are they surrounded with a box.    I imagine this is a CSS issue, but I can't figure it out.    Here is the HTML (generated from django templates), with the snippet pasted as-is:         Any ideas?
