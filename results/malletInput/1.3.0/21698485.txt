  bootsnipp snippet won't render correctly  i'm trying to use a bootsnipp snippet in my page. namely,  collapsible-tree-menu-with-accordion . however the entire thing is being rendered in a 'flat' way. the collapse/expand mechanism is working fine, but the list items are not indented, nor are they surrounded with a box.    i imagine this is a css issue, but i can't figure it out.    here is the html (generated from django templates), with the snippet pasted as-is:         any ideas?
