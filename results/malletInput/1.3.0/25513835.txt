' / /responsive.less' wasn't found  i am trying to move my application to another server, and i am currently getting the following error.     ' / /responsive.less' wasn't found (in /home/rails/**/app/assets/stylesheets/ _and_overrides.css.less)      i don't have an :assets block in my gemfile -- so the previous solutions to this problem don't apply to my situation.    here is my gemfile     source '  bundle edge rails instead: gem 'rails', github: 'rails/rails' gem 'rails', '4.1.1' # use sqlite3 as the database for active record gem 'sqlite3' # use scss for stylesheets #gem 'sass-rails', '~  4.0.3' # use uglifier as compressor for javascript assets gem 'uglifier', ' = 1.3.0' # use coffeescript for .js.coffee assets and views gem 'coffee-rails', '~  4.0.0' # see   for more supported runtimes # gem 'therubyracer',  platforms: :ruby  # use jquery as the javascript library gem 'jquery-rails' # turbolinks makes following links in your web application faster. read more:   'turbolinks' # build json apis with ease. read more:   'jbuilder', '~  2.0' # bundle exec rake doc:rails generates the api under doc/api. gem 'sdoc', '~  0.4.0'  # spring speeds up development by keeping your application running in the background. read more:   'spring'  #for user management gem 'devise' gem 'cancan' gem 'rolify'  #for adding attachments gem 'paperclip', github: 'thoughtbot/paperclip'  #for   gem 'therubyracer' gem 'less-rails' gem ' - -rails' gem ' _form'  gem 'debugger'  # use activemodel has_secure_password # gem 'bcrypt', '~  3.1.7'  # use unicorn as the app server # gem 'unicorn'  # use capistrano for deployment # gem 'capistrano-rails'  # use debugger #gem 'debugger'      any help is appreciated! i'm more or less clueless regarding this error.    additional note: my application functions properly on my current server, but i cannot get it to run even once on my new server and i have tried to install it identically.
