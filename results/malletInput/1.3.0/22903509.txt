angular ui   errors: 'datepickerctrl.modes is undefined' and 'datepickerctrl.modes is undefined'  i am trying to use angular ui   components and keep getting errors when i implement accordion and datepicker.    a link can be viewed at    /     the accordions expand but specifically i get         "error: accordionctrl.addgroup is not a function" for each accordion group...."      and for datepicker         "error: datepickerctrl.modes is undefined" for each instance...."      however, the tabs work fine.    am doing something wrong in setting it up? i have angularjs v1.3.0-beta.2 and ui- -tpls-0.10.0.js included. i have declared the module as      var ngui = angular.module('nguiapp', ['ngroute', 'ui. ' ]);    appreciate any help.
