Angular UI Bootstrap errors: 'datepickerCtrl.modes is undefined' and 'datepickerCtrl.modes is undefined'  I am trying to use Angular UI Bootstrap components and keep getting errors when I implement Accordion and Datepicker.    A link can be viewed at    /     The accordions expand but specifically I get         "Error: accordionCtrl.addGroup is not a function" for each accordion group...."      and for Datepicker         "Error: datepickerCtrl.modes is undefined" for each instance...."      However, the tabs work fine.    Am doing something wrong in setting it up? I have AngularJS v1.3.0-beta.2 and ui- -tpls-0.10.0.js included. I have declared the module as      var ngUI = angular.module('nguiApp', ['ngRoute', 'ui. ' ]);    Appreciate any help.
