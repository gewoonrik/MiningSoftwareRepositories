Rails: Bootstrap dropdown menu not working  I am quite new to Rails and have been following the tutorial by Michael Hartl.  Everything has been going along really well until I got to the drop down menu, which was wasn't working, then was working and now isn't working :(  I've read several posts and fixes and I suspect my tinkering has gotten to the point where quite simply, I've done something to stop it working. I will say that I initially had the  -sass 2.x in my gem file, then changed it to 3.x, but went back to 2.x because I didn't realise that going to 3.x would result in issues due to class name changes.  So, perhaps the time this was working was when I had  -sass 3.x installed, not sure.  From what I can tell though everything is set up the way it needs to be.  I am developing under Windows 8.1 and I had to fix an issue with execjs and in specific the runtimes.rb file.  So, here are my details:    Gemfile:         Would really appreciate some help on this to get past this issue.    Thanks in advance, and please let me know if I can provide anymore information.
