    / twipsy  i like the idea of the twipsy plugin that is bundled as part of   boostrap, but it doesn't seem to work correctly.    here's a jsfiddle:        as you can see, using the default settings as prescribed by the docs, the tooltip appears when you hover over the tool-tipped anchor, but it doesn't go away when you move the mouse away.    i understand that the appearance of the tooltip relies on css, but on the   docs page the tooltips are being added and removed from the dom by the script, whereas in this example and in my own local tests the script adds the tip but never removes it.    here's a link to the script:  http:// .github.com/ /1.3.0/ -twipsy.js     any ideas / suggestions? i'm pretty confused as to why this is behaving as it is.    alternatively if anyone has a better suggestion for a clean, lightweight jquery tooltip plugin, please let me know.    thanks!
