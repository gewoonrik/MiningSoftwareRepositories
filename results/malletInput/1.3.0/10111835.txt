why is mix() not working with my colors in lessc?  my less file piggy-backs on to the end of the     files (so things like  @white  are defined already.  here is my less code:     @columnsortscreen: #99f; // the color used @columnsort: mix( @white, @columnsortscreen );      when compiled, i get the following error (everything underlined by carets is highlighted):     non_object_property_loaderror: error evaluating function `mix`: cannot read property 'value' of undefined in /users/cmv/sites/...../tablesorter.less:12:14 11 // the color used 12  @columnsort: mix( @white, @columnsortscreen );                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      what am i doing wrong?  lessc is version 1.3.0.    thanks!
