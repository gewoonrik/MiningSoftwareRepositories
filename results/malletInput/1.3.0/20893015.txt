    and respond.js too responsive in ie8  i'm having some issues with testing     v3 in ie8. the problem seems to be the layout goes completely responsive in ie8 instead of showing the desktop version on the desktop using windows 7.    this is the code in my head:          !-- just for debugging purposes. don't actually copy this line! --   !--[if lt ie 9]  script src="../../docs-assets/js/ie8-responsive-file-warning.js"  /script  ![endif]--    !-- html5 shim and respond.js ie8 support of html5 elements and media queries --   !--[if lt ie 9]     script src=" "  /script     script src=" "  /script   ![endif]--               i see one of their examples works just fine, so i'm not sure what's going wrong here.
