  is not styling anything  i am using   but it is not styling anything for some reason.     i've tried pasting the   code for forms and navbars into my home view and it just shows like normal without the   styling.     i have     @import " "; in my stylesheet    and the appropriate gems in my gemfile. is there some part of the setup that i am forgetting? or why would it not be working. i've used it in past projects just a few days ago but not sure why it is not styling anything this time around.    this is my gemfile:     source '  ' -sass', '~  3.1.1'  gem 'simple_form'  # bundle edge rails instead: gem 'rails', github: 'rails/rails' gem 'rails', '4.0.3'  # use sqlite3 as the database for active record gem 'sqlite3'  # use scss for stylesheets gem 'sass-rails', '~  4.0.0'  # use uglifier as compressor for javascript assets gem 'uglifier', ' = 1.3.0'  # use coffeescript for .js.coffee assets and views gem 'coffee-rails', '~  4.0.0'  # see   for more supported runtimes # gem 'therubyracer', platforms: :ruby  # use jquery as the javascript library gem 'jquery-rails'  # turbolinks makes following links in your web application faster. read more:   'turbolinks'  # build json apis with ease. read more:   'jbuilder', '~  1.2'  group :doc do   # bundle exec rake doc:rails generates the api under doc/api.   gem 'sdoc', require: false end  # use activemodel has_secure_password # gem 'bcrypt-ruby', '~  3.1.2'  # use unicorn as the app server # gem 'unicorn'  # use capistrano for deployment # gem 'capistrano', group: :development
