Bootstrap Modal wont show up  I am trying to create a simple interface with Bootstrap. I have a small page with a few things. It works just fine, but then I wanted to add a modal element to it. I took the example directly from the second    example . But when I try to use it only the shadow appears, which because the buttons don't appear I can't exit out of it. Why can't I get the modal to work?    Initial code:
