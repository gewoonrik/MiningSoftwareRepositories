Twitter   top menu is not displaying as strip  I just started using twitter  . Trying each example in their site. However I couldn't succeed in most cases. For instance, the top navigation bar. I just copied into a html file. Changed some reference paths for css, js. When browsed in IE8/Chrome, it shows a weird result.    === source copied from:    .com/examples/navbar-fixed-top/          ===            Note: There is a head closing tag body open tag that I couldn't insert   (here) right before fixed nav bar      the outcome on my browser:         Am I missing anything?
