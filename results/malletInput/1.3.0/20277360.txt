    top menu is not displaying as strip  i just started using    . trying each example in their site. however i couldn't succeed in most cases. for instance, the top navigation bar. i just copied into a html file. changed some reference paths for css, js. when browsed in ie8/chrome, it shows a weird result.    === source copied from:    .com/examples/navbar-fixed-top/          ===            note: there is a head closing tag body open tag that i couldn't insert   (here) right before fixed nav bar      the outcome on my browser:         am i missing anything?
