"popover" problems on     css/javascript library  i've tried to implement popover javascript on my site with     and i couldn't. if anyone could help me with my code, i would appreciate a lot. thanks in advance for that.         i have tried "html: true" and the   doc example "offset: 10". it does shows the red danger button, but nothing happens then (the popover doesn't work).    and something else, how could i implement this on the td element of the table rather than the button?
