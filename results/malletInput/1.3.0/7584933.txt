"popover" problems on twitter   css/javascript library  I've tried to implement popover javascript on my site with twitter   and i couldn't. If anyone could help me with my code, i would appreciate a lot. thanks in advance for that.         i have tried "html: true" and the   doc example "offset: 10". It does shows the red danger button, but nothing happens then (the popover doesn't work).    And something else, how could i implement this on the TD element of the table rather than the button?
