Peformance issue with   datepicker  Not sure if it's a setting I moved, but I'm having an issue with   datepicker loading a lot of localization files on every single page I visit of my project, even if no component in the page uses a datepicker element.    I get something like this from my development.log:         Any clues what may be the issue?
