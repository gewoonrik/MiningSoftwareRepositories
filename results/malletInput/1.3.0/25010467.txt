peformance issue with   datepicker  not sure if it's a setting i moved, but i'm having an issue with   datepicker loading a lot of localization files on every single page i visit of my project, even if no component in the page uses a datepicker element.    i get something like this from my development.log:     started get "/assets/ -datepicker/locales/ -datepicker.ar.js?body=1" for 127.0.0.1 at 2014-07-29 00:14:15 -0700   started get "/assets/ -datepicker/locales/ -datepicker.az.js?body=1" for 127.0.0.1 at 2014-07-29 00:14:15 -0700   started get "/assets/ -datepicker/locales/ -datepicker.bg.js?body=1" for 127.0.0.1 at 2014-07-29 00:14:15 -0700   ...   started get "/assets/ -datepicker/locales/ -datepicker.zh-cn.js?body=1" for 127.0.0.1 at 2014-07-29 00:14:16 -0700   started get "/assets/ -datepicker/locales/ -datepicker.zh-tw.js?body=1" for 127.0.0.1 at 2014-07-29 00:14:16 -0700      a lot of lines, from ar to zh-tw, which as the names denote, they're the individual localisation files for each language/region.    this isn't a problem for my production server, but on development it's really significant. under vagrant, loading those files takes somewhere around 7700ms before every page, and under vmware around 2300ms.    my application.rb only has the following:     config.action_controller.include_all_helpers = false      and my gemfile:     source '  'rails', '4.1' gem 'sass-rails', '~  4.0.0' gem 'uglifier', ' = 1.3.0' gem 'coffee-rails', '~  4.0.0' gem 'jquery-rails' gem 'turbolinks' gem 'jbuilder', '~  1.2' gem 'haml-rails' gem 'jquery-turbolinks' gem 'jquery-datatables-rails', git: '  'jquery-ui-rails' gem 'highcharts-rails' gem 'rack-mini-profiler' gem 'devise' gem 'highstock-rails' gem 'yaml_db', github: 'jetthoughts/yaml_db', ref: 'fb4b6bd7e12de3cffa93e0a298a1e5253d7e92ba' gem 'hirb'  gem 'therubyracer' gem 'less-rails' gem ' - -rails', :git =  'git://github.com/seyhunak/ - -rails.git', :branch =  ' 3'  gem ' -datepicker-rails', :require =  ' -datepicker-rails', :git =  'git://github.com/nerian/ -datepicker-rails.git'  group :development, :test do   gem 'sqlite3' end group :production do   gem 'mysql2' end      any clues what may be the issue?
