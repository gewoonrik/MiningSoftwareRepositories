Trying to get DropDownList to work in MVC 5. Bootstrap 3  I'm having this code in my _Layout.cshtml. And as you can se in the section "sidebar-start" I have a dropdown-html-list called "Sites". But I can't get the dropDown working. I basicly copy/pasted in the whole raw html from a working   3.0 - theme. But the dropDown wont work. Is my scripts wrong or something? Please help!    Full code here:
