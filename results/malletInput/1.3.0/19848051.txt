    popovers (and   in general) not working  i realize this question has been asked multiple times before, but unfortunately, i am unable to find a solution from the existing questions   answers. i have created an html file which i think will have   functionality by linking to the cdn. it has a link to the jquery cdn as well.    well ... i just noticed that the   styles are not loading at all. i am not sure why.    nonetheless, i am assuming that fix will be relatively minor, but i have been struggling for much longer than that to figure out why the popover is not working.     please, if you are answering, make sure you are referencing the    3  rules.      note: the structure of the below code was taken straight from the   website.     without further ado !    here's the code.       !doctype html   html     head       title   101 template /title       meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"       !--   --       link rel="stylesheet" href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.2/css/ .min.css"        !-- html5 shim and respond.js ie8 support of html5 elements and media queries --       !-- warning: respond.js doesn't work if you view the page via file:// --       !--[if lt ie 9]         script src=" "  /script         script src=" "  /script       ![endif]--     /head     body       div class="container"           div class="row"               div class="btn-group-vertical"                   a href="#" class="btn btn-default" rel="popover" data-content="output" data-placement="right" data-trigger="click" 1 /a                   a href="#" class="btn btn-default" rel="popover" data-content="output" data-placement="right" data-trigger="click" 2 /a                   a href="#" class="btn btn-default" rel="popover" data-content="output" data-placement="right" data-trigger="click" 3 /a               /div           /div       /div        !-- jquery (necessary for  's javascript plugins) --       script src=" "  /script        !-- include all compiled plugins (below), or include individual files as needed --       script src="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.2/js/ .min.js"  /script   script      $('.btn').popover();  /script     /body   /html
