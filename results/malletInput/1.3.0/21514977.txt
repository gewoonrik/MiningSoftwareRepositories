Bootstrap Switch doesn't switch  I'm trying a very simple straight forward integration of Bootstrap Switch (   -switch.org/ ), however for some reason, the switch won't toggle. No errors are given by the system, it just doesn't change status when I click it (tried on Windows 8 - Chrome).    My code for testing is following (I'm using the JS and CSS directly from their site to prevent any errors from that):         Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong?
