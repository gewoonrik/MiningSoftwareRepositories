  switch doesn't switch  i'm trying a very simple straight forward integration of   switch (   -switch.org/ ), however for some reason, the switch won't toggle. no errors are given by the system, it just doesn't change status when i click it (tried on windows 8 - chrome).    my code for testing is following (i'm using the js and css directly from their site to prevent any errors from that):         any ideas on what i'm doing wrong?
