can't get mvcminiprofiler to show up  i'm trying to throw together a site pretty quickly, and so i enlisted the help of   's   project , which has been a lifesaver for a non-designer like me.    i'm now attempting to get the miniprofiler up and running (it looks awesome!) but am having some trouble getting it to display and i hope someone can help me catch my (likely simple) mistake. this is the most basic of basic scenarios, and as far as i can tell i'm following the recommendations of the miniprofiler site.     global.asax:          any ideas? the site displays exactly fine, but without any sort of miniprofiler action.    thanks in advance for any help you can give!
