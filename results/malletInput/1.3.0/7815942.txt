Can't get mvcMiniProfiler to show up  I'm trying to throw together a site pretty quickly, and so I enlisted the help of  Twitter's Bootstrap project , which has been a lifesaver for a non-designer like me.    I'm now attempting to get the MiniProfiler up and running (it looks awesome!) but am having some trouble getting it to display and I hope someone can help me catch my (likely simple) mistake. This is the most basic of basic scenarios, and as far as I can tell I'm following the recommendations of the MiniProfiler site.     global.asax:          Any ideas? The site displays exactly fine, but without any sort of MiniProfiler action.    Thanks in advance for any help you can give!
