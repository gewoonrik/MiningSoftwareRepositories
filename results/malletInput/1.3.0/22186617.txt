sliding overlay panel that works with   3 css  i've been endlessly searching for a sliding overlay panel using jquery that doesn't destroy my   3 css file. but i can't find any. i need a panel that is like a form, has dropdowns, selectable grids, input boxes, etc.. and anything i do on this menu panel will refresh the content panel automatically; but in my case it's not really considered a "menu", its just a sliding or pop-out form that you can fill out.    i've searched this site:           and not a single one gave me what i wanted. i need a sliding panel that comes from the left, filled up with forms (like   accordion, select2 dropdown).    the first link gave exactly what i wanted, but rendering the content of my   css came into heavy conflict and was rendered useless.    the most perfect example i was able to find is located here:           when you click the overlay button; it does exactly what i needed in terms of functionality.    but using this library also conflicts with  . i've tried 5 different libraries, all ending in failure. it just seems that a simple idea such as this could have had some kind of leeway by now.    if anyone has had any kind of success, i'd love to hear it. otherwise i'm all out of options  at this point.    [edit 6/17/2014] a big requirement for me is to have a button that is kept static, it doesn't move with the sliding panel. i didn't want the user to move the button every time the user slid a panel out. i also needed this functionality to exist for ie7+. i want to have more control over what is moving, want is sliding, the effects, everything. not a total 100% full slide.
