how to correctly order my containers in a responsive   page?  i'm trying to figure out how to set the order of my containers in a page so that they will correctly reorder themselves in both mobile and desktop layouts when resized.    here is my code, the order is correct here in tablet [col-sm]   and phone [col-xs] views:         the problem is for a desktop layout, there is a big gap under the 1st nav div, the social div should be immediately beneath the 1st nav in desktop and larger views regardless of the height of the content div.    how do i fix this? i tried using the pull, push, offset and float methods, but nothing gave me the correct results.
