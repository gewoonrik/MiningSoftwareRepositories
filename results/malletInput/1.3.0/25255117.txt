horizontally tile div tags with   and maximize on click  i'm using angular js and   to display some dynamic data, i currently have it tiling 3 divs. however i need it to tile more than 3 i need them to be smaller, however i can't figure out the bottstrap if i use the smaller column size it just puts one or 2 per row. i need at least 7 per row. also my function to have them maximize on click isnt working either and i dont know why..    this is what im at now it all works except for setting the ngclick i get an error..
