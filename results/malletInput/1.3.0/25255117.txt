Horizontally Tile Div Tags with Bootstrap and maximize on click  I'm using angular JS and Bootstrap to display some dynamic data, I currently have it tiling 3 divs. However I need it to tile more than 3 i need them to be smaller, however I can't figure out the bottstrap if i use the smaller column size it just puts one or 2 per row. I need at least 7 per row. Also my function to have them maximize on click isnt working either and i dont know why..    This is what im at now it all works except for setting the ngclick I get an error..
