Bootstrap overrides with less using the twitter- -rails gem do not take effect?  I am trying to override variables in my  _and_overrides.css.less file, per the instructions in the file. I know the file is parsed because if I introduce a syntax error the application will not load, but setting less variables, e.g.         In a possibly related issue, I am unable to include glyphicons in my html.    Edit: less variables are interpreted in production when I precompile and push to production (heroku). It appears that it may be an issue with development.
