lesscss client-side issue on ubuntu server 12.04 with      in advance, i apologize if the question title may not be be convenient. i'm pretty sure that ubuntu server 12.04 is not the cause, but i can explain where is the trick...    my website uses   with less and its client-side compilation (i'm on development cycle so i want to keep it on client). everything works fine on my local instance (a laptop with ubuntu 12.04) but style is not generated when requesting the same website from my server instance (running on ubuntu server 12.04).    both runs apache 2.2.22 with the same mods : alias, auth_basic, authn_file, authz_default, authz_groupfile, authz_host, authz_user, autoindex, cgi, deflate, dir, env, headers, mime, negotiation, php5, reqtimeout, rewrite, setenvif, ssl, status.       what i get from my local instance (ubuntu 12.04)  works fine !       !doctype html   html lang="fr"       head           meta charset="utf-8"           title my website /title           meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" name="viewport"           meta content="" name="description"           meta content="alterphp" name="author"           link href="/bundles/mywebsite/css/main.less" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet/less"           link href="/ /less/responsive-768px-979px.less" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet/less"           script type="text/javascript" src="/jquery/jquery.js"  ...  /script           script type="text/javascript" src="/jquery.form.js"  ...  /script           script type="text/javascript" src="/bundles/mywebsite/js/less-1.3.0.min.js"  ...  /script           style id="less:bundles-mywebsite-css-main" type="text/css" media="screen"  **style is well processed**  /style           style id="less:error-message" type="text/css" media="screen"  ...  /script       /head       body          ...      /body   /html       with firebug, i can see that only two main less files appear as downloaded in the network tab.  main.less  imports many less files that are all processed in the main.less response.       what i get from my server instance (ubuntu server 12.04) doesn't work !      !doctype html   html lang="fr"       head           meta charset="utf-8"           title my website /title           meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" name="viewport"           meta content="" name="description"           meta content="alterphp" name="author"           link href="/bundles/mywebsite/css/main.less" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet/less"           link href="/ /less/responsive-768px-979px.less" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet/less"           script type="text/javascript" src="/jquery/jquery.js"  ...  /script           script type="text/javascript" src="/jquery.form.js"  ...  /script           script type="text/javascript" src="/bundles/mywebsite/js/less-1.3.0.min.js"  ...  /script           style id="less:error-message" type="text/css" media="screen"  ...  /script       /head       body          ...      /body   /html       no style is processed from main.less ... with firebug, i can see that all less files imported from  main.less  appear as downloaded in the network tab.     edit 1 :  i reach my pages, and every resources one-by-one (each less files is reachable and complete). i have no error in the network tab, it's just that less style is not processed on my server instance...       i take any suggestion about this enigma !
