Rails 3.2.12 with less and Twitter Bootstrap: V8 Error  I would like to use Twitter Bootstrap with a current Ruby on Rails version.  I tried to use "less-rails- ". I followed:    -less-and-sass-understanding-your-options-for-rails-3-1/     I created a new rails project. Then I added "gem 'less-rails- '" to the Gemfile, installed it and after that I added " *= require twitter/ " to application.css    I got this error:         How can I use Bootstrap with Rails 3.2.12? Thank you very much for your help!
