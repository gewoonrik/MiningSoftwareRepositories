jQuery plug-in not working  I am now writing a web page using a   3 template. When I include a jquery plugin ( jquery-frontier-calendar ) in my page, I found that it does not work. I guess the problem is due to overlapping of javascript library.    For example, if I use the code below, the calendar works well but dropdown menu in my page not work.         Could anyone help to fix this problem?????
