jquery plug-in not working  i am now writing a web page using a   3 template. when i include a jquery plugin ( jquery-frontier-calendar ) in my page, i found that it does not work. i guess the problem is due to overlapping of javascript library.    for example, if i use the code below, the calendar works well but dropdown menu in my page not work.         could anyone help to fix this problem?????
