django crispy form button not showing  i am sure that i'm being very dense, but have spent days trying to work out what i've done wrong.    i have      installed django-crispy-forms (using pip)   added 'crispy_template_pack' to my settings   added 'crispy_forms' to my applications   done a 'collectstatic' from the downloaded tar file (since templates and css aren't included in the pip)   added '{% crispy_forms_tags %} to my form html file   imported from crispy_forms.helper and crispy_forms.layout to my forms.py      i'm using   3, which i'm coding directly rather than using  -toolkit    the   renders fine on all my pages and so do the form fields, but the buttons won't appear.    my html is as follows:     {% extends 'base.html' %} {% load crispy_forms_tags %}   html    title add guest /title     div class='container'      {% block col1 %}      div class='row'           div class="span3"          {% endblock %}          {% block col2 %}          div class="span9"               ul                  {% crispy form %}              /ul           /div  !--/span9--          {% endblock %}      /div  !--row--   /div  !--/container--    /html       if i change the crispy tag to {% crispy myform myform.helper %} i get 'variabledoesnotexist at' plus a continuous of many (real) languages.  rendered as above the form fields appear but not the button.    my forms.py looks like this:     from django.forms import modelform from django import forms from crispy_forms.helper import formhelper from crispy_forms.layout import layout, fieldset, buttonholder, submit from .models import author  class newauthorform(forms.modelform):     class meta:         model = author         # if you pass formhelper constructor a form instance         # it builds a default layout with all its fields         helper = formhelper()         helper.form_method = 'post'         helper.add_input(submit('save', 'save', css_class = 'btn-primary'))      i know that there's some redundancy here in terms of imports, but figure that isn't the problem.    lastly, my base.html is:      !doctype html   html     head       title   101 template /title       meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"       !--   --       link href="{{ static_url }}css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet"        !-- note that thereâ€™s also blue.uni-form.css and dark.uni-form.css available if you want to try chan--       link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ static_url }}crispy_forms/static/uni_form/uni-form.css" type="text/css" /       link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ static_url }}crispy_forms/static/uni_form/default.uni-form.css" type="text/css" /       !-- uni-form js library, optional --       script src="{{ static_url }}crispy_forms/static/uni_form/uni-form.jquery.js" type="text/javascript"  /script         !-- html5 shim and respond.js ie8 support of html5 elements and media queries --       !-- warning: respond.js doesn't work if you view the page via file:// --       !--[if lt ie 9]         script src=" "  /script         script src=" "  /script       ![endif]--     /head     body           div class='container'              {% block col1 %}              div class='row'                   div class="span3"                  {% endblock %}                  {% block col2 %}                  div class="span9"                   /div  !--/span9--                  {% endblock %}              /div  !--row--           /div  !--/container--        !-- jquery (necessary for  's javascript plugins) --       script src=" "  /script       !-- include all compiled plugins (below), or include individual files as needed --       script src="{{ static_url }}js/ .min.js"  /script     /body   /html       i've put the crispy form templates in my templates folder, which is at the same level as manage.py.  as i say, all the   renders fine.    i'm stumped.  any ideas gratefully received
