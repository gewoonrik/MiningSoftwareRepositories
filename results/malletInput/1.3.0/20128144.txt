django crispy form button not showing  I am sure that I'm being very dense, but have spent days trying to work out what I've done wrong.    I have      installed django-crispy-forms (using pip)   added 'CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK' to my settings   added 'crispy_forms' to my applications   done a 'collectstatic' from the downloaded tar file (since templates and CSS aren't included in the pip)   added '{% crispy_forms_tags %} to my form html file   imported from crispy_forms.helper and crispy_forms.layout to my forms.py      I'm using Bootstrap 3, which I'm coding directly rather than using  -toolkit    The Bootstrap renders fine on all my pages and so do the form fields, but the buttons won't appear.    My html is as follows:         I've put the crispy form templates in my templates folder, which is at the same level as manage.py.  As I say, all the   renders fine.    I'm stumped.  Any ideas gratefully received
