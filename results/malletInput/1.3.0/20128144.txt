django crispy form button not showing  i am sure that i'm being very dense, but have spent days trying to work out what i've done wrong.    i have      installed django-crispy-forms (using pip)   added 'crispy_template_pack' to my settings   added 'crispy_forms' to my applications   done a 'collectstatic' from the downloaded tar file (since templates and css aren't included in the pip)   added '{% crispy_forms_tags %} to my form html file   imported from crispy_forms.helper and crispy_forms.layout to my forms.py      i'm using   3, which i'm coding directly rather than using  -toolkit    the   renders fine on all my pages and so do the form fields, but the buttons won't appear.    my html is as follows:         i've put the crispy form templates in my templates folder, which is at the same level as manage.py.  as i say, all the   renders fine.    i'm stumped.  any ideas gratefully received
