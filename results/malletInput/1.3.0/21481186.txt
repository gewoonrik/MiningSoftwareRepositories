Maven Webjars -  -datepicker makes   invisible  I've tried to use Bootstrap and Bootstrap-Datepicker in my SpringMVC project:  GitHub repo     I trying to include both Bootstrap and Bootstrap-Datepicker via WebJars like this:         This is working as expected. When I leave boostrap-datepicker section uncommented, the browser starts to see  -datepicker files, also as expected. Unfortunately, the browser console starts to throw similar errors saying that now Bootstrap files are not visible! It seems that boostrap-datepicker is somehow overriding Bootstrap.    I've tried to change my includes order and still the same effect. All of my .jsp files (CSS and JS includes) seem to be valid, because Bootstrap is visible when Maven does not try to include the datepicker. Is there a simple way to check what is visible in my webjars folder after compilation?    I am very confused. I couldn't find any useful information on the Internet. I've spent whole day on this, so any help would be hugely appreciated. Thanks in advance!
