how to create a postfix button in  -  for rails?  i recently switched from  foundation zurb  , to      for rails .     and in  foundation zurb  , the postfix button was already provided within the existing options, which is not the case for   - -rails .     i tried doing stuff like this      div class="col-sm-2"       f.text_area :search, :class =  "text_area"       %= button_tag "name", type: 'button', class: "btn btn-info"%   /div       but i could not seem to even go near it.    can anyone provide some useful method to do this?    ps :  for those of you who do not know what is a postfix button, it is exactly as the button that is in youtube for instance, next to the search bar. check this  link  and scroll down to pre/post fix buttons ,and you'll see what i am talking about.      ======================================     a look into my gemfile as requested by @sadik      source '  bundle edge rails instead: gem 'rails', github: 'rails/rails' gem 'rails', '4.1.2' # use mysql as the database for active record gem 'mysql2' # use scss for stylesheets gem 'sass-rails', '~  4.0.3' # use scss for stylesheets gem 'less-rails' # use uglifier as compressor for javascript assets gem 'uglifier', ' = 1.3.0' # use coffeescript for .js.coffee assets and views gem 'coffee-rails', '~  4.0.0' # see   for more supported runtimes gem 'therubyracer',  platforms: :ruby  # use jquery as the javascript library gem 'jquery-rails' # turbolinks makes following links in your web application faster. read more:   'turbolinks' # build json apis with ease. read more:   'jbuilder', '~  2.0' # bundle exec rake doc:rails generates the api under doc/api. gem 'sdoc', '~  0.4.0',          group: :doc # spring speeds up development by keeping your application running in the background. read more:   'spring',        group: :development # use activemodel has_secure_password gem 'bcrypt', '~  3.1.7' # user activemodel act_as_list gem 'acts_as_list', '~  0.4.0'  # use unicorn as the app server # gem 'unicorn'  # use capistrano for deployment # gem 'capistrano-rails', group: :development  # use debugger # gem 'debugger', group: [:development, :test]  #use activemodel geocoded_by :address after_validation :geocode  gem 'geocoder'  #user scsss for stylesheets  gem ' - -rails', :git =  'git://github.com/seyhunak/ - -rails.git'      ===============================================    update #1 :  solved     thanks to the answer below, but not really the answer, thanks to the comment that specified that i should update to the right version of  - .    if you are facing the same problem, go to your gemfile and write      gem ' - -rails', github: 'seyhunak/ - -rails', branch: ' 3'      and  bundle install  and absolutely then  rails g  :install less  to the end of story that you already know.    for further support, check this  link
