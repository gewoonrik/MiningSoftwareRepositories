   : less compilation taking a long time  i'm writing a simple app using    . in my main html file i have the following lines:      link rel="stylesheet/less" href="/static/less/style.less"   script src="/static/js/libs/less-1.3.0.min.js"  /script       so every time i refresh the page, the whole css gets generated. this takes about 15 seconds each time, so it's a pain waiting for the page to load.    i tried using simpless to generate css out of the less files but the generation failed. i'll try to get that to work, but i'm also wondering whether i'm not doing something wrong...    i dislike the fact that the css is generated each time, even if i don't change the less files. is there a way to make less cache the css somehow? or perhaps there are other alternative solutions to this problem?
