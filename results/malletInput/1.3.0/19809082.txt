  not working  all i am trying to do is to get some text to begin in the middle of the screen.     here is the code below. note that i have included the minified   css and js files in my project directory along with my html file without subdirectories. i got those files from the precompiled   3.0.1 download. i also tried using the links to the cdn instead. still didn't work. when i open this code in firefox i don't see any positioning active at all. other   styles didn't work either, like i tried to do   p class = "large"  blah  /p   and it didn't make the text large.     note: to make it easier for people to test the page, i replaced links to local   files with a link to the   cdn file.       !doctype html   html     head       title   101 template /title       meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"       !--   --       !-- latest compiled and minified css --   link rel="stylesheet" href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.2/css/ .min.css"    !-- optional theme --   link rel="stylesheet" href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.2/css/ -theme.min.css"        !-- html5 shim and respond.js ie8 support of html5 elements and media queries --       !-- warning: respond.js doesn't work if you view the page via file:// --       !--[if lt ie 9]         script src=" "  /script         script src=" "  /script       ![endif]--     /head     body       div class="row"         div class="span3 offset9"           p class="large" this text /p         /div       /div        h1 hello, world! /h1     /body   /html
