second font awesome icon displaying on hover  in my navbar dropdown, when i hover over the links, the icons (icon-group, icon-plus) also have another icon (icon-filter) show up. this only happens on the   down down menu. i can't find any reference in the source file to the "icon-filter" class being applied.    you can view the incorrect icons in the dropdown at the link below.         gemfile:
