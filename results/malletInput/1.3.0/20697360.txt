  divs with spans less then 12 still taking up full row  i am brand new to  . i downloaded the precompiled   code right off the getting started tab of the   page. i saved the css, fonts, and js files in the same folder as my project. within this folder i also included an index.html page. the index.html code file is shown below.     index.html       !doctype html   html     head       title   101 template /title       meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"       !--   --       link href="css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet"       style type="text/css"          .span12 {             background: black;             color: white;             padding: 20px 0px;             text-align: center;         }          .span6 {             background: blue;             color: white;             padding: 20px 0px;             text-align: center;             margin-top: 15px;         }      /style       !-- html5 shim and respond.js ie8 support of html5 elements and media queries --       !-- warning: respond.js doesn't work if you view the page via file:// --       !--[if lt ie 9]         script src=" "  /script         script src=" "  /script       ![endif]--     /head     body       div class="container"           div class="row"               div class="span12" span 12 /div           /div            div class="row"               div class="span6" span 6 /div               div class="span6" span 6 /div           /div       /div        !-- jquery (necessary for  's javascript plugins) --       script src=" "  /script       !-- include all compiled plugins (below), or include individual files as needed --       script src="js/ .min.js"  /script     /body   /html       when this code runs the two divs with class span6 get displayed on different lines and each of them takes up a span of 12. i know that divs are typically displayed as block elements but i thought that by giving them a class of span6 and containing them within the same row div   would display them on the same line each taking up a span of 6.    what am i doing wrong that is causing the   12 column grid to function differently from how i expected?
