Bootstrap divs with spans less then 12 still taking up full row  I am brand new to  . I downloaded the precompiled   code right off the getting started tab of the   page. I saved the css, fonts, and js files in the same folder as my project. Within this folder I also included an index.html page. The index.html code file is shown below.     index.html          When this code runs the two divs with class span6 get displayed on different lines and each of them takes up a span of 12. I know that divs are typically displayed as block elements but I thought that by giving them a class of span6 and containing them within the same row div   would display them on the same line each taking up a span of 6.    What am I doing wrong that is causing the   12 column grid to function differently from how I expected?
