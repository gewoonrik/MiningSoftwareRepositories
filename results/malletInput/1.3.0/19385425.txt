Why is Bootstrap (3) not displaying correctly in RoR?  I'm attempting to update the look of the  devise  sign in page using  Bootstrap . I'm using a  gem  by anjlab for Bootstrap 3.     I'm running Rails 4.0 and I'm attempting to replicate the example found  here :           but when I copy the html I get the following in my application:          I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong or if I've not configured something correctly. Can someone assist to so I can get my sign in page looking like the example on the   website?    Markup:
