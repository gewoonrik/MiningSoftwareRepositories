Compiling Twitter Bootstrap Less files - compiler errors after clone  I've just cloned   from the official github repository. When trying to compile the less files using the official less app however, I get the following errors:         ...in a number of files. I have in my index.html file:         Is there something I am missing to deploy this correctly? I only want to do static html and javascript files for a quick prototype project.    Update: here is the problem i get on the command line trying to build via the make method. Using the latest less.js script from the official website.
