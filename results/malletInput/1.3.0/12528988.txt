compiling     less files - compiler errors after clone  i've just cloned   from the official github repository. when trying to compile the less files using the official less app however, i get the following errors:         ...in a number of files. i have in my index.html file:      link href="../less/ .less" rel="stylesheet/less"   script src="../js/less-1.3.0.min.js"  /script       with both scripts in the correct locations. the directory tree is as follows     --     -- js   -- html   -- less   -- img   -- docs      is there something i am missing to deploy this correctly? i only want to do static html and javascript files for a quick prototype project.    update: here is the problem i get on the command line trying to build via the make method. using the latest less.js script from the official website.
