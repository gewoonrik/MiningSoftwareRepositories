Bootstrap Full Background Image Being Pushed Down  I am currently using twitter   and having an issue when trying to have the html background image display a full screen    Instead of my columns having a background image behind them they actually push the background image to the very bottom of the page instead of allowing it lay behind them.    Any ideas here?    This is whats happening  Screenshot of error     HTML:
