datetime editortemplates in mvc works on windows but not on android tablet  i have set up a datetime edittemplate in asp.net nvc and it works fine on windows, my problem is that the value does not display on an andriod divice.     the components i am using are:    3  .date picker   a link  on asp.net nvc    this seems to be working fine with windows and the   date picker works fine.     edittemplate uk date format     @model nullable system.datetime   @if (model.hasvalue) {       @*this uses the model.value*@       @html.textbox("", string.format("{0:dd/mm/yyyy}", (system.datetime)model.value), new {@class = "form-control datecontrol", type = "date" })  } else {     @*defalt value on new records*@     @html.textbox("", string.format("{0:dd/mm/yyyy}", datetime.now), new {@class = "form-control datecontrol", type = "date"})   }       i can only think the problem is with the datetime edittemplate not displaying properly on the andriod divice.    thanks sorry about the layout it's my first post!
