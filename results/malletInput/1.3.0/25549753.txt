datetime editortemplates in mvc works on windows but not on android tablet  i have set up a datetime edittemplate in asp.net nvc and it works fine on windows, my problem is that the value does not display on an andriod divice.     the components i am using are:    3  .date picker   a link  on asp.net nvc    this seems to be working fine with windows and the   date picker works fine.     edittemplate uk date format         i can only think the problem is with the datetime edittemplate not displaying properly on the andriod divice.    thanks sorry about the layout it's my first post!
