DateTime EditorTemplates in MVC works on Windows but not on android tablet  I have set up a DateTime edittemplate in asp.net NVC and it works fine on windows, my problem is that the value does not display on an andriod divice.     The components I am using are:  Bootstrap 3 Bootstrap.date picker   a Link  on asp.net nvc    This seems to be working fine with windows and the   date picker works fine.     EditTemplate uk date format         I can only think the problem is with the DateTime edittemplate not displaying properly on the andriod divice.    Thanks sorry about the layout it's my first post!
