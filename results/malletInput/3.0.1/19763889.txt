responsive navbar in   3: not all links visible on smartphones  i have a small project, using  . unfortunately there is an issue with the responsive navbar. when i open the site on my mobile phone (android 4.3, chrome browser/firefox/opera) the dropdown is not fully visible - and not scrollable. so the last link can't be seen. this might be even wore on devices with smaller displays... i found out that version 3.0.1. of the framework should "fix" this, but i after trying out this bugfix nothing changed. maybe someone here can help me? here is a more detailes description of this bug from some other people on github:    /issues/10601     and this this link you can test it - if you just resize your browser window to a very small size and then click the menu-icon and try to see all links you'll see that ists not possible:    .com/examples/navbar-fixed-top/     jan
