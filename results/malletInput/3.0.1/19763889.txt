Responsive navbar in Bootstrap 3: not all links visible on smartphones  I have a small project, using Bootstrap. Unfortunately there is an issue with the responsive navbar. When I open the site on my mobile phone (Android 4.3, Chrome Browser/Firefox/Opera) the Dropdown is not fully visible - and not scrollable. So the last Link can't be seen. This might be even wore on devices with smaller displays... I found out that Version 3.0.1. of the framework should "fix" this, but I after trying out this bugfix nothing changed. Maybe someone here can help me? Here is a more detailes description of this bug from some other people on Github:    /issues/10601     And this this Link you can test it - if you just resize your browser window to a very small size and then click the menu-icon and try to see all Links you'll see that ists not possible:    .com/examples/navbar-fixed-top/     Jan
