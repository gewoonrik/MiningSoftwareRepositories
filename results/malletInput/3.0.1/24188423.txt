icons not showing when optimizations are enabled with   3.0.1 and asp .net mvc 4  i'm using   3.0.1 with asp .net mvc 4 and i want to display some icons, like with:      i class="icon-remove"  /i       here is my   bundle.     bundles.add(new stylebundle("~/css/ ").include(     "~/content/ /body.css",     "~/content/ / -responsive.css",     "~/content/ / -mvc-validation.css",     "~/content/ / -theme.css",     "~/content/ / .css"     ));      but when i enable optimizations, it looks like there is no icon css classes in the bundle.     bundletable.enableoptimizations = true;      when i open the /css/ ?v=8eaow9v58s_xu995jppd57vwg8ohfzpa5qzr95hdcow1 file i don't find the .icon-remove class whereas i see it in  .css.    any help would be appreciated.
