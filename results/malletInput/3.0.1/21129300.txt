  3.0.x - how to unconstrain input-group input width when using glyphicons?  not sure if this is a feature or a bug...    there has been a change in behaviour with  input-groups  using  glyphicons  between   -3.0.0  and   -3.0.1 and above .    starting from  -3.0.1, adding a  glyphicon  to an  input-group  causes the  input  width to be constrained.    i have two  input-groups : one with a  glyphicon-user , the other with an ascii  @  sign.     new behaviour:     as can be seen from the image below, with   -3.0.1 and above , the width of the   input-group  with a  glyphicon-user  is constrained, while the one with an  @  sign is not.          jsfiddle  of the above issue with   -3.0.3  (behaviour is the same with  3.0.1  and  3.0.2 )     old behaviour:     on the other hand, as can be seen from the image below, the previous behaviour with   -3.0.0  meant the width of the   input-group  with a  glyphicon-user  was not constrained, thereby matching the one with an  @  sign.          jsfiddle  of the above with   -3.0.0      question:     how can i get the   -3.0.0  behaviour (unconstrained input-groups when using glyphicons)?
