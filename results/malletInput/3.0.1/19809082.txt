  not working  all i am trying to do is to get some text to begin in the middle of the screen.     here is the code below. note that i have included the minified   css and js files in my project directory along with my html file without subdirectories. i got those files from the precompiled   3.0.1 download. i also tried using the links to the cdn instead. still didn't work. when i open this code in firefox i don't see any positioning active at all. other   styles didn't work either, like i tried to do
