Bootstrap not working  All I am trying to do is to get some text to begin in the middle of the screen.     Here is the code below. Note that I have included the minified   css and js files in my project directory along with my html file without subdirectories. I got those files from the precompiled Bootstrap 3.0.1 download. I also tried using the links to the CDN instead. Still didn't work. When I open this code in Firefox I don't see any positioning active at all. Other Bootstrap styles didn't work either, like I tried to do
