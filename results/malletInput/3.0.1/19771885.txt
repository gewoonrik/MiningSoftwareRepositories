  dropdown menu behind image  i am using   3.0.1.  i created a dropdown menu, it works fine in firefox and chrome but with ie 8, the dropdown menu falls behind the carousel.    i have read many other questions about this topic: about z-index, stacking contexts and so on, but i can't find the solution in my case    here's my web page:        can someone see what i am doing wrong?    thanks (sorry for my poor english)       (edit)    this is the code         and now it runs perfectly
