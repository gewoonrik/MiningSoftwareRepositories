Bootstrap dropdown menu behind image  I am using Bootstrap 3.0.1.  I created a dropdown menu, it works fine in Firefox and Chrome but with IE 8, the dropdown menu falls behind the carousel.    I have read many other questions about this topic: about z-index, stacking contexts and so on, but I can't find the solution in my case    Here's my web page:        Can someone see what I am doing wrong?    Thanks (sorry for my poor english)       (Edit)    This is the code         and now it runs perfectly
