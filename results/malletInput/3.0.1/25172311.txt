Display Bootstrap Model from Asp.Net Webforms  Need Suggestions, how to open a twitter   modal, from Asp.net Webform code behind?    I want to open the modal based on some requirement at the moment of the save. Once user click on the save button , it runs the validations in code behind and if there are any validation errors , display all errors in   modal dialog. This all should happen on Save button click.    I tried with below piece of code , but it prompts me java script error "Error: Object doesn't support property or method 'modal'". Thanks    Asp.Net Webforms 4.5    Bootstrap V3.0.1    JQuery-1.9.0.js    jquery-ui-1.8.24.js
