showing and hiding content  i miraculously produced my own webpage using dreamweaver cs6 and a css   template that i found.  i am a rookie...and am shocked i've gotten this far. site for ref:        my question: i want to show and hide content particularly for long paragraphs. maybe with a "read more" link or a "read more" button.  my "services" page template has "read more" buttons with the following code:         for example go?  when i put it in the head it shows as text on my page.      alternately, if i highlight text in a paragraph tag and assign it a "hidden text" class via the dw interface....the text hides, but i have no way of referencing it to get it to show.  i tried to put the "class title"....for example "hidden text", which is the tag that wraps the text that i highlighted, in place of the "#" after href but that didn't work.    hope this makes sense.  thank you in advance for your help!
