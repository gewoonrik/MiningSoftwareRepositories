Showing and hiding content  I miraculously produced my own webpage using Dreamweaver CS6 and a CSS Bootstrap Template that I found.  I am a ROOKIE...and am shocked I've gotten this far. Site for ref:        My question: I want to Show and Hide content particularly for long paragraphs. Maybe with a "Read More" link or a "Read More" button.  My "Services" page template has "Read More" buttons with the following code:         for example go?  When I put it in the head it shows as text on my page.      Alternately, If I highlight text in a Paragraph tag and assign it a "hidden text" class via the DW interface....the text hides, but I have no way of referencing it to get it to show.  I tried to put the "Class Title"....for example "Hidden Text", which is the tag that wraps the text that I highlighted, in place of the "#" after href but that didn't work.    Hope this makes sense.  Thank you in advance for your help!
