showing and hiding content  i miraculously produced my own webpage using dreamweaver cs6 and a css   template that i found.  i am a rookie...and am shocked i've gotten this far. site for ref:        my question: i want to show and hide content particularly for long paragraphs. maybe with a "read more" link or a "read more" button.  my "services" page template has "read more" buttons with the following code:      a class="btn btn-secondary pull-right" href="#" read more /a       i understand that if i replace the "#" after href, then i can denote a link for the button to connect to (a picture, website, another page, etc.)    but i want more text to show when the read more button is pressed. i don't want to link to a different page or file.    css   page gives the following:    showing and hiding content force an element to be shown or hidden (including for screen readers) with the use of .show and .hidden classes. these classes use !important to avoid specificity conflicts, just like the quick floats. they are only available for block level toggling. they can also be used as mixins.    .hide is available, but it does not always affect screen readers and is deprecated as of v3.0.1. use .hidden or .sr-only instead.    furthermore, .invisible can be used to toggle only the visibility of an element, meaning its display is not modified and the element can still affect the flow of the document.    html:      div class="show" ... /div   div class="hidden" ... /div       // classes     .show {   display: block !important; } .hidden {   display: none !important;   visibility: hidden !important; } .invisible {   visibility: hidden; }      // usage as mixins     .element {   .show(); } .another-element {   .hidden(); }      i basically understand how to use the html code.  but where does the other code,     .element {   .show(); } .another-element {   .hidden(); }      for example go?  when i put it in the head it shows as text on my page.      alternately, if i highlight text in a paragraph tag and assign it a "hidden text" class via the dw interface....the text hides, but i have no way of referencing it to get it to show.  i tried to put the "class title"....for example "hidden text", which is the tag that wraps the text that i highlighted, in place of the "#" after href but that didn't work.    hope this makes sense.  thank you in advance for your help!
