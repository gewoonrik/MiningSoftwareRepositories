fix     collapse icons, glyphicons  i changed    's behaviour so the whole panel-heading would trigger the accordion. this results in the 'up' icon not changing in the 'down' icon anymore.    i am trying to fix this, but to no avail. how can i restore the correct behaviour of these icons?         ps: i'm using   3.0.1
