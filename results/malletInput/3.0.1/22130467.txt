iconfonts only show in chrome on hover  i am using   glyphicons and fontawesome icons and am experiencing a strange bug where they do not show unless hovered over, at which point they are permanently visible. when i reload the page they aren't visible again.    this only happens in chrome. safari and firefox both show the icons normally.    i am running chrome v33.0.1750 - this has never happened before.
