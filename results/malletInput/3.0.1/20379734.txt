  3 built in image replacement?  while digging through mixins.less file of   3 i found the following:     // css image replacement // // heads up! v3 launched with with only `.hide-text()`, but per our pattern for // mixins being reused as classes with the same name, this doesn't hold up. as // of v3.0.1 we have added `.text-hide()` and deprecated `.hide-text()`. note // that we cannot chain the mixins together in less, so they are repeated. // // source:   deprecated as of v3.0.1 (will be removed in v4) .hide-text() {   font: ~"0/0" a;   color: transparent;   text-shadow: none;   background-color: transparent;   border: 0; } // new mixin to use as of v3.0.1 .text-hide() {   font: ~"0/0" a;   color: transparent;   text-shadow: none;   background-color: transparent;   border: 0; }      has anyone been using this? where do i specify the image that i want to replace the text? am i right to assume that all this does is to hide text and not replacing it with an image?
