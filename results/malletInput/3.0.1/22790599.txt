calculating media sizes used in   3 less files when max page width is 780px  i have the "honor" of building the new responsive template for a series of very old sites. these sites are ugly as sin and the layouts built with tables. we are migrating the old system to a new system and we are building the new version one page at a time. to accomplish this seamlessly we have to (for the time being) make the new site, at least the frame around it, look identical to the old site.    i have chosen   3.1 as my base css framework. i like it so far and have a had a lot of luck with it. but i am restricted due to the fact that the page width for the content area is stuck (forceably by previous design) at a max width of 780px.    as you can imagine this has created some awkwardness for the smaller responsive screen sizes. i am building the css in each environment from the less files and customizing what i need but otherwise sticking to the core   less files.    i want the smaller screen sizes to transition smoothly with the grid system. but i am not sure how to size things properly.    here are the screen size definitions i am using so far:         does anyone have any suggestions on how to improve the smaller sizes considering the max-width of 780px? i want to be able to use things like col-xs-2 or col-sm-offset-2 and actually get it to move things around in smaller increments. of course i may be misunderstanding how those are supposed to work. i am a developer not a designer.    thanks!
