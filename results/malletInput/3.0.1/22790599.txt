calculating media sizes used in   3 less files when max page width is 780px  i have the "honor" of building the new responsive template for a series of very old sites. these sites are ugly as sin and the layouts built with tables. we are migrating the old system to a new system and we are building the new version one page at a time. to accomplish this seamlessly we have to (for the time being) make the new site, at least the frame around it, look identical to the old site.    i have chosen   3.1 as my base css framework. i like it so far and have a had a lot of luck with it. but i am restricted due to the fact that the page width for the content area is stuck (forceably by previous design) at a max width of 780px.    as you can imagine this has created some awkwardness for the smaller responsive screen sizes. i am building the css in each environment from the less files and customizing what i need but otherwise sticking to the core   less files.    i want the smaller screen sizes to transition smoothly with the grid system. but i am not sure how to size things properly.    here are the screen size definitions i am using so far:     // extra small screen / phone // note: deprecated @screen-xs and @screen-phone as of v3.0.1 @screen-xs:                  480px; @screen-xs-min:              @screen-xs; @screen-phone:               @screen-xs-min;  // small screen / tablet // note: deprecated @screen-sm and @screen-tablet as of v3.0.1 @screen-sm:                  562px; @screen-sm-min:              @screen-sm; @screen-tablet:              @screen-sm-min;  // medium screen / desktop // note: deprecated @screen-md and @screen-desktop as of v3.0.1 @screen-md:                  770px; @screen-md-min:              @screen-md; @screen-desktop:             @screen-md-min;  // large screen / wide desktop // note: deprecated @screen-lg and @screen-lg-desktop as of v3.0.1 @screen-lg:                  770px; @screen-lg-min:              @screen-lg; @screen-lg-desktop:          @screen-lg-min;   // so media queries don't overlap when required, provide a maximum @screen-xs-max:              (@screen-sm-min - 1); @screen-sm-max:              (@screen-md-min - 1); @screen-md-max:              (@screen-lg-min - 1);   //== grid system // //## define your custom responsive grid.  //** number of columns in the grid. @grid-columns:              12; //** padding between columns. gets divided in half for the left and right. @grid-gutter-width:         10px; // navbar collapse //** point at which the navbar becomes uncollapsed. @grid-float-breakpoint:     @screen-sm-min; //** point at which the navbar begins collapsing. @grid-float-breakpoint-max: (@grid-float-breakpoint - 1);   //== container sizes // //## define the maximum width of `.container` for different screen sizes.  // small screen / tablet @container-tablet:             ((720px + @grid-gutter-width)); //** for `@screen-sm-min` and up. @container-sm:                 @container-tablet;  // medium screen / desktop @container-desktop:            ((770px + @grid-gutter-width)); //** for `@screen-md-min` and up. @container-md:                 @container-desktop;  // large screen / wide desktop @container-large-desktop:      ((770px + @grid-gutter-width)); //** for `@screen-lg-min` and up. @container-lg:                 @container-large-desktop;      does anyone have any suggestions on how to improve the smaller sizes considering the max-width of 780px? i want to be able to use things like col-xs-2 or col-sm-offset-2 and actually get it to move things around in smaller increments. of course i may be misunderstanding how those are supposed to work. i am a developer not a designer.    thanks!
