Calculating media sizes used in Bootstrap 3 LESS files when max page width is 780px  I have the "honor" of building the new responsive template for a series of VERY old sites. These sites are ugly as sin and the layouts built with tables. We are migrating the old system to a new system and we are building the new version one page at a time. To accomplish this seamlessly we have to (for the time being) make the new site, at least the frame around it, look identical to the old site.    I have chosen Bootstrap 3.1 as my base CSS framework. I like it so far and have a had a lot of luck with it. But I am restricted due to the fact that the page width for the content area is stuck (forceably by previous design) at a max width of 780px.    As you can imagine this has created some awkwardness for the smaller responsive screen sizes. I am building the CSS in each environment from the LESS files and customizing what I need but otherwise sticking to the core   LESS files.    I want the smaller screen sizes to transition smoothly with the grid system. But I am not sure how to size things properly.    Here are the screen size definitions I am using so far:         Does anyone have any suggestions on how to improve the smaller sizes considering the max-width of 780px? I want to be able to use things like col-xs-2 or col-sm-offset-2 and actually get it to move things around in smaller increments. Of course I may be misunderstanding how those are supposed to work. I am a developer not a designer.    Thanks!
