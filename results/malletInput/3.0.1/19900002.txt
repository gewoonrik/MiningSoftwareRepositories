why aren't the   3.0.1.1 glyphicons displaying in ie8  i download the latest version of    ,  version 3.0.1.1  using nuget and i am using it in a  visual studio 2012 asp.net mvc 4  application.    after the download it only put the following files in the content directory:       -theme.css    -theme.min.css    .css    .min.css      and in my scripts directory the following:       .js    .min.js      i've also included the  respond.js  and  html5shiv.js  files.    when i run the application in  ie8  it doesn't seem to find the glyphicons that i put on my views.  there are just squares that seem like placeholders where the glyphicons should be.  when i run the application in the latest version of  firefox  then it is there.  i don't understand why?    can anyone please share some light?
