Bootstrap 3 with masonry  I've a problem with a grid using twitter   (new version 3.0.1) with a fluid container and the jquery masonry plugin.    In default (1200px width) there should be 3 elements in each row. If i start with 4 col-xs-3 elements everything works just fine (see example in comments). But my problem is when starting with col-xs-6 / col-xs-3 / col-xs-3.    The issue can be seen here:        Does not work:         Any ideas ???
