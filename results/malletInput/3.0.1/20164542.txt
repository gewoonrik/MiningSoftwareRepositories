Bootstrap modal stopped working in Chrome / Firefox but ok in IE8  I have just recently noticed my   modals have stopped working when I hadn't changed anything. I've searched here and Google and no one has the same issue exactly. To prove my point I copied the Bootstrap demo code into a file and it proves not to work in Chrome or Firefox but does in IE8. I'm writing in asp.net 4, .aspx files using Microsoft VWD2010express.         the above code is from here ->    .com/javascript/#modals     under Modal    versions of browser are IE8:8.0.7601. Chrome: 31.0.1650.57 m. Firefox: 23.0.1
