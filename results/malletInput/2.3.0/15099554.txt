why respond.js and css3-mediaqueries.js both are not working in ie 7 & 8 for me?  i am building a html page with     version 2.3.0. since ie less than 9 does not support media queries i tried to use css3-mediaqueries.js. the documentation says you need to just include the script after all css. i did that. below is my page layout.         what i am doing wrong here?
