why respond.js and css3-mediaqueries.js both are not working in ie 7 & 8 for me?  i am building a html page with     version 2.3.0. since ie less than 9 does not support media queries i tried to use css3-mediaqueries.js. the documentation says you need to just include the script after all css. i did that. below is my page layout.         !doctype html       html lang="en"       head         meta charset="utf-8"         meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"         meta name="description" content="responsive page"         meta name="author" content="author name"         title responsive page built on     /title         link href="css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet" type='text/css'         link href="css/ -responsive.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type='text/css'         link href="css/my-page.css" rel="stylesheet" type='text/css'         link href="css/my-page-responsive.css" rel="stylesheet" type='text/css'        /head        body          div class="container"            !-- my html goes here --          /div          !--[if lt ie 9]           script src=" "           /script   ![endif]--        /body       /html       but still no luck. i have not used any html5 element in my page. there is no error logged in javascript  console.    then i tried to use respond.js which throws the below exception.      unspecified error. respond.js, line 309      what i am doing wrong here?
