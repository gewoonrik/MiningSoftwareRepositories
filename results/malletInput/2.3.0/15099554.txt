why Respond.js and CSS3-mediaqueries.js both are not working in IE 7 & 8 for me?  I am building a HTML page with Twitter Bootstrap version 2.3.0. Since IE less than 9 does not support media queries I tried to use css3-mediaqueries.js. The documentation says you need to just include the script after all css. I did that. Below is my page layout.         What I am doing wrong here?
