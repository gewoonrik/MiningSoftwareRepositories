    typeahead doesn't load ajax data  i have the following code in place to initialize typeahead using version 2.3.0:     jquery('#search_terms').typeahead({     source: function(query, process) {         return jquery.ajax({             url: '/api/path',             type: 'get',             data: {q: query},             datatype: 'json',             success: function (json) {                 return process(json.suggestion);             }         });     } });      i've verified that typeahead works by substituting static data. i've seen that json.suggestion evaluates to a single word as expected. the ajax response itself looks like this:      {"suggestion":"word"}      however,   refuses to load the response into typeahead. what am i missing? i admit that i'm having trouble finding detailed documentation of   typeahead via ajax other than here on so.    thanks in advance.
