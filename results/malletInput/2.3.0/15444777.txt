Why Does This Work? - Twitter Boostrap 2.3.1  I recently  posted a question  where I asked how I may be able to vertically align a responsive image. I found the answer on my own, but it raised an even bigger question because I have no idea how or why it works.    Take a look at this jsFiddle:         which uses the following code to vertically align an image in the navbar:          However, without Bootstraps newest version (2.3.1) this does not work!   Take a look at this jsFiddle:         This second jsFiddle does not include Boostrap 2.3.1 but DOES contain Boostrap 2.3.0 (contained inside an external css file I called layout.css) and yet it does not work.     Question:  Does anyone know what part of Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.1 is causing the image inside the navbar to be responsive?
