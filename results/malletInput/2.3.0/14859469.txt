Detect Customized Twitter Bootstrap Settings (CSS, Variables, & Plugins)  I have built a site using Twitter Bootstrap.    When I  customized my Bootstrap download  I set custom values for colors, gutter widths, etc.    Two months later, I would like to upgrade to Bootstrap Version 2.3.0 but have forgotten what values I set for these custom values.     Rather than going through all of my code and searching for these values and plugging them into my new customized download package, is there a way to "Import" my current  .css file, detect the settings, and then upgrade to the new version?    I have seen functionality such as this on the  jQuery Mobile Themeroller  whereby you import your CSS by copy   paste, and the site performs the upgrade for you.    Is there anything similar for Twitter Bootstrap? Or is there a way to do this without comparing hundreds of lines of code?
