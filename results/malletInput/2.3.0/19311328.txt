I have also tried installing from command line but failed. the error log is as following.     : problems summary :: :::: ERRORS         grailsCentral: bad organisation found in    /tags/RELEASE_3_0_0/twitter- -3.0.0.pom : expected='' found='org.grails.plugins'    what should I do now ? Thanks in advance.
