Twitter Bootstrap: inline selects not aligning  SEE:             If you make the result pane wide enough, you'll see the select fields try to go in an inline layout. I'm having a bit of problem with this, but it's not clearly seen in JSFiddle.    My screen shot       -- from Chrome, aligns correctly    However, in FF and IE, the "Max Year" select is not horizontally aligned with "Min Year"; instead, it's much lower, like this:       -- from FF    Initially, I thought it may have something to do with the contents of "Min Year" or "Max Year", so I started tweaking them. But nothing fixed it. When I deleted the node for "Min Price" and "Max Price", then "Min Year" and "Max Year" were suddenly OK.    Any ideas what's wrong?
