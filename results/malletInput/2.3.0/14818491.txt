   : inline selects not aligning  see:             if you make the result pane wide enough, you'll see the select fields try to go in an inline layout. i'm having a bit of problem with this, but it's not clearly seen in jsfiddle.    my screen shot       -- from chrome, aligns correctly    however, in ff and ie, the "max year" select is not horizontally aligned with "min year"; instead, it's much lower, like this:       -- from ff    initially, i thought it may have something to do with the contents of "min year" or "max year", so i started tweaking them. but nothing fixed it. when i deleted the node for "min price" and "max price", then "min year" and "max year" were suddenly ok.    any ideas what's wrong?
