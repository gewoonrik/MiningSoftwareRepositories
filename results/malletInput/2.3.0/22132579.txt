  datepicker gem not formatting in rails  i know this type of question has come up before on so, and i have tried every solution i could find, but nothing seems to work. the javascript is working fine, but for some reason, i can't get the datepicker window to go in the right spot or format correctly. after testing multiple gems, i keep getting this:         there are no errors in my console. here is what my related gems look like in my  gemfile :     gem 'jquery-rails', "~  2.3.0" gem ' -sass' gem ' -datepicker-rails'      and here is my  application.js      //= require jquery //= require jquery_ujs //= require turbolinks //= require   //= require  -datepicker //= require_self      and my  application.css  has:     *= require  -datepicker      as for the actual html file, it looks like this ( application#index.html )      input type="text" data-behaviour='datepicker'     script type="text/javascript"    $(document).ready(function(){     $('[data-behaviour~=datepicker]').datepicker();   })  /script       any and all ideas are welcome.     update:    it seems like my   css files aren't loading at all. do i need to use css.scss files? i can't seem to find a straightforward answer online. manually inserting the  css  into my  application.css  file results in this:
