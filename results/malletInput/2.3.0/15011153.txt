CSS margin when element inside has position absolute  I'm in a quite annoying situation... I think it's the best to just show what I've made and tell you what the problem is, instead of explaining everything.    I've been searching for a solution quite a while now, but I can't find it.    If you go to     you see a three boxes with a h1 tag and an image inside. I have clipped the image with CSS(this has to be done this way, can't get around that). I'm trying to center the image in the box, but I can't manage to do that. I think that's because of the absolute positioning of the img element.    Code:             I am using Twitter Bootstrap and the website I'm building is going to be fully responsive, so just adding a margin-left is does not work for me..    I hope I managed to make clear what the problem is.    Thanks in advance for the help!
