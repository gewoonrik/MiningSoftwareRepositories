css margin when element inside has position absolute  i'm in a quite annoying situation... i think it's the best to just show what i've made and tell you what the problem is, instead of explaining everything.    i've been searching for a solution quite a while now, but i can't find it.    if you go to     you see a three boxes with a h1 tag and an image inside. i have clipped the image with css(this has to be done this way, can't get around that). i'm trying to center the image in the box, but i can't manage to do that. i think that's because of the absolute positioning of the img element.    code:             i am using     and the website i'm building is going to be fully responsive, so just adding a margin-left is does not work for me..    i hope i managed to make clear what the problem is.    thanks in advance for the help!
