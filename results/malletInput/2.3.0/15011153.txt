css margin when element inside has position absolute  i'm in a quite annoying situation... i think it's the best to just show what i've made and tell you what the problem is, instead of explaining everything.    i've been searching for a solution quite a while now, but i can't find it.    if you go to     you see a three boxes with a h1 tag and an image inside. i have clipped the image with css(this has to be done this way, can't get around that). i'm trying to center the image in the box, but i can't manage to do that. i think that's because of the absolute positioning of the img element.    code:      html   head       link href="//netdna. cdn.com/ - /2.3.0/css/ -combined.min.css" rel="stylesheet"        style type="text/css"          .photo-div {             overflow:auto;             height:250px;             border: 1px solid #000;         }          .photo-div-content {             width:100%;             margin:0 auto;         }          img.clipped {             position:absolute;             clip:rect(0px,200px,200px,0px);         }      /style   /head   body       div class="container"           div class="row"               div id="div-1" class="photo-div span4"                   div class="photo-div-content"                       h1 logitech mouse /h1                       img class="clipped" src=" "                   /div               /div                   div id="div-2" class="photo-div span4"                   div class="photo-div-content"                       h1 logitech mouse /h1                       img class="clipped" src=" "                   /div               /div               div id="div-3" class="photo-div span4"                   div class="photo-div-content"                       h1 logitech mouse /h1                       img class="clipped" src=" "                   /div               /div           /div       /div   /body           i am using     and the website i'm building is going to be fully responsive, so just adding a margin-left is does not work for me..    i hope i managed to make clear what the problem is.    thanks in advance for the help!
