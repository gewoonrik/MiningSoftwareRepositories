    expanding text using the "collapse" plugin  has anyone figured out how to use      collapse plugin  where some text is shown (say, 100 characters) and you click a button to expand the text to show the rest of it?     here's a jsfiddle that demonstrates the following issues i'm having :      the hidden text is shown on a  new  line. would be preferable if sentences wouldn't be visually disrupted.    the  icon-plus-sign  indicator's display isn't toggled (doesn't go away on showing hidden text and re-appear vice versa).      fully working html:      link href="//netdna. cdn.com/ - /2.3.0/css/ -combined.min.css" rel="stylesheet"   script src="//netdna. cdn.com/ - /2.3.0/js/ .min.js"  /script    div class="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#div1"         span  b div1: /b  this is a sentence at the end of the first 100 characters that gets truncated  /span    i class='icon-plus-sign'  /i    /div   div id="div1" class="collapse"  such that characters 101 to infinity are not shown inline with the beginning of the sentence ( b div1 /b ). /div    div class="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#div2"     span  b div2: /b this is a sentence at the end of the first 100 characters that gets truncated  /span    i class='icon-plus-sign'  /i    /div   div id="div2" class="collapse"  such that characters 101 to infinity are not shown inline with the beginning of the sentence ( b div2 /b ). /div
