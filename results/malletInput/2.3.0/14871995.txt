meteor stopped working after update to version 0.5.5  i've upgraded  meteor  to version  0.5.5  today. after restarting the server, my site stopped working, because   modals don't appear. the meteor change logs shows an update to    2.3.0  and  jquery 1.9  included.     are there any known problems with this versions? especially with modals?    btw: the browser shows the following error in jquery.js on loading:     unhandled error: maximum recursion depth exceeded
