fuelux datagrid breaks   dropdown menus  i am having troubles with fuelux's datagrid component. one the page of my site where i implement the datagrid component, the dropdown menus provided by   stop working.    i'm using:jquery 1.9.0, fuelux 2.3.0,   2.3.1 i am not using: requirejs.    i am bringing in the fuelux css files and the loader.js file. the   menus work on every other page except for this one. the datagrid component seems to operate just fine except that it's own select menus aren't working either.    any pointers?
