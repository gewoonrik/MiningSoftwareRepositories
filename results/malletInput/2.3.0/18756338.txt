Knockout.js Bindinghandlers Bootstrap.DatePicker  I'm using Twitter Bootstrap.DatePicker with knockout. The problem that I'm having is that I can't get it to work properly. It's working fine when there is an initial date, but when there is no initial date I am getting the following error:  Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'getTime' of undefined       HTML          I have created a JSFiddle where the behaviour is demonstrated        I's using knockout 2.3.0 and Bootstrap.datepicker 1.1.3.1    I hope that someone can help me solve this problem.
