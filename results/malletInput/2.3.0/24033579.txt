how do i limit jquery dependency in   with my project bower.json?  i need to support ie8 in a web app and have to make sure jquery 1.10+ is used and not 2.0+.    my project bower.json file has dependencies listed like so:         how can i modify my bower.json dependences to 'restrict' the   jquery dependency it's own config file will install?    hope that makes sense.  thanks!
