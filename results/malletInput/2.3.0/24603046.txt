file upload form broken by javascript  have a really bizarre issue which i can't work out.    essentially i'm trying to add a file upload form to my existing web app. the markup is super simple at the moment:          form action="#" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post"           ul               li               label for="imagefield"  image file  /label               input id="imagefield" type="file" /               /li  li               input type="submit" value="submit content" /               /li           /ul       /form       and in the head i include two scripts:          script type="text/javascript" src="myapplibs.js"  /script       script type="text/javascript" src="myappcore.js"  /script         myapplibs.js  is a concatenation of several libraries ( knockout js,  , jquery  to name a few). and myappcore contains the actual application logic, ko view models and a websocket client.    what's happening is with both these files inlcuded, the file dialog does not appear in chrome and firefoxx (works fine in ie).    if i remove  either  of these includes the file dialog appears fine in all browsers.    trying to debug this there are no errors in the console and the css of the form is identical in both cases. editing the concatenation step i've found is i remove  knockout-2.3.0.js  the dialog works as well.    any suggestions on how to proceed with debugging this issue? i've searched through the libraries and my own code can can't find anything modifying  input type='file'  elements.
