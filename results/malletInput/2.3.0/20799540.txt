  bootsrap 2 row full width  i'm trying to write a  row  in     2.3.0 that goes full width with no right/left borders/margins, i've tried:    ( the style will than be a class in the css file )      div class="row" style="background:#5498cc; height:150px; margin: -40px 0px 0px 0px;"       div class="span12"        /div   /div       i've also tried this (taken from a question in stackoverflow):      div style="margin: 0 auto;  width: 100%;"       div class="row" style="background:#5498cc; height:150px;"           div class="span12"            /div       /div   /div       the second works better but still not right as shows here:         still has borders on left and right. the point is that this div i'm creating  is already inside another  container  div     any help to fix this?
