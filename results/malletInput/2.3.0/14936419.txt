  menu toggle first click not working properly  im using  -collapse.js v2.3.0, but for some reason on the first click the menu just appears and doesnt slide down. i also noticed the height doesnt say  auto  , it says  205px . i dont have the menu set to this height anywhere in the css. after the first click, when i go to toggle it closed, everything seems perfect, the height toggles between 0 and auto and there is a smooth transition as opposed to it instantly appearing.    im unsure as to what code to include as it seems to be the   toggle that is the problem,  however here is the html... i removed irrelivent bits of code..      div class="navbar"    div class="navbar-inner"                  a data-target=".nav-collapse" data-toggle="collapse" class="brand visible-phone"      categories    /a           a data-target=".nav-collapse" data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-navbar"       span class="icon-bar"  /span       span class="icon-bar"  /span       span class="icon-bar"  /span     /a     div class="nav-collapse"        ul class="nav"           li  //more code  /li            li class="dropdown"  a href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" //more code  b class="caret"  /b  /a               ul class="dropdown-menu"                 li //code /li                 ul                            li //code /li                  /ul             /ul        /li        li //code /li              but here is a link to the site...
