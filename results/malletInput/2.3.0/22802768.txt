  dropdown is not working with requirejs  here's my code     requirejs.config({     paths: {         'knockout': '/scripts/vendors/knockout/knockout-2.3.0',         'knockout-validation': '/scripts/vendors/knockout/knockout.validation',         'knockout-postbox': '/scripts/vendors/knockout/knockout-postbox',         'knockout-mapping': '/scripts/vendors/knockout/knockout.mapping',         'jquery': '/scripts/vendors/jquery/jquery-1.10.2',         ' ': '/scripts/vendors/ / '      },     shim: {         ' ': {             deps: ['jquery'],             exports: '$'         },         'knockout-validation': ['knockout'],         'knockout-mapping':  ['knockout'],         'knockout-postbox': ['knockout']     },     enforcedefine : true });      so when i resize my screen i get the responsive dropdown but its not working properly. i hacked in by inserting the scripts directly to the page.that's how i know why the requirejs is not working.    i tried a bunch of questions on stackoverflow but nothing seems to be working. i'm using   3.0.0
