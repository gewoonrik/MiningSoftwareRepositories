  dropdown is not working with requirejs  here's my code         so when i resize my screen i get the responsive dropdown but its not working properly. i hacked in by inserting the scripts directly to the page.that's how i know why the requirejs is not working.    i tried a bunch of questions on stackoverflow but nothing seems to be working. i'm using   3.0.0
