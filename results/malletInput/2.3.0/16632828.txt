Django served  .js file not working in mobile  Edit: So I've narrowed the problem down - it works when I link to an externally hosted  .min.js file, and doesn't work when I use the local file (django's dev static folder setup)    This has me pulling my hair out. I've looked at tons of threads, inspected the HTML very carefully, and I can't tell what's the difference. Here's my dev page:    , and here's the jsfiddle        The problem is on a mobile browser (iPhone and iPad) the login dropdown closes when I click on it. Many threads recommended  . I ran my code through the w3 validator and there are no errors. Any idea what could be causing this?    Currently, my page is set to use the local static file. It's been included properly and everything - you can see it at    -2.3.0/js/ .min.js  . I've checked the headers, and I don't see anything strange - so why does it cause that javascript bug when I link to the local file? Other parts of the file - like the carousel plugin - seem to be working.
