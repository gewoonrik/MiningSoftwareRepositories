how to adjust the delay of the opening of a   modal?  i am using  gem " -sass", "~  2.3.0.0" , which means that i am using    2 . the modal is documented  here .    my own modal starts like this:     #modal.modal.hide.fade{"aria-hidden" =  "true", "aria-labelledby" =  "jobsmodallabel", :role =  "dialog", :tabindex =  "-1"}      i open my modal like this:     $("#modal").modal().css "margin-left": -          -($(@).width() / 2)      i would like to have it load faster, but i can't read from the documentation how to control the delay time. i have tried to remove the  .fade  class from my modal, but that speeds to loading up too much. so i need to keep the fade functionality, but just make it faster.    not sure if this is a js or css problem. i suppose it can be solved both ways, but i don't know how.    when i overwrite my  .fade  class with the below, my fading does not speed up:     .fade {    opacity: 0;    -webkit-transition: opacity 0.01s linear;       -moz-transition: opacity 0.01s linear;        -ms-transition: opacity 0.01s linear;         -o-transition: opacity 0.01s linear;            transition: opacity 0.01s linear; }      if i increased to e.g.  3.00s , it slows down though...    it seems like  .fade  has to do with the process of adding backdrop. i wish to speed up the process of the modal traveling from the top of the screen to its final position. this process happens after the backdrop is added.
