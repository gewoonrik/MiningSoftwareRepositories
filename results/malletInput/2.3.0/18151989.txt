One image resizes properly, other does not with Twitter Bootstrap  I'm using Bootstrap 2.3.0 on the following website:        The problem I am having is that when the browser window is resized or when a user is using a tablet/phone, the two logos at the very top of the page are not displaying as I would like.    Below I am showing this behaviour using Chrome on my desktop.    Situation #1: full screen display, logos are spread out and full size. I'm happy with this.      Situation #2: screen size is decreased, but logos are still full size. I would like for either the logos to stay on the same line and for the logos to scale (shrink).      Situation #3: this would likely be solved by whatever fixes situation #2, but I just wanted to show that if I shrink the browser width further, the Agrium logo has scaled (yay!) but the AgTracker logo has not (boooo).         Any help with updating the CSS or way I am using Bootstrap that allows for the logos to both scale and remain on the same line would be appreciated.
