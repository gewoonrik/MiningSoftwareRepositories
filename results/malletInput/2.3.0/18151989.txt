one image resizes properly, other does not with      i'm using   2.3.0 on the following website:        the problem i am having is that when the browser window is resized or when a user is using a tablet/phone, the two logos at the very top of the page are not displaying as i would like.    below i am showing this behaviour using chrome on my desktop.    situation #1: full screen display, logos are spread out and full size. i'm happy with this.      situation #2: screen size is decreased, but logos are still full size. i would like for either the logos to stay on the same line and for the logos to scale (shrink).      situation #3: this would likely be solved by whatever fixes situation #2, but i just wanted to show that if i shrink the browser width further, the agrium logo has scaled (yay!) but the agtracker logo has not (boooo).         any help with updating the css or way i am using   that allows for the logos to both scale and remain on the same line would be appreciated.
