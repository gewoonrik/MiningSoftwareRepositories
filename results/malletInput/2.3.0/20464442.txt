 -datepicker-rails not working via simple_form with   modal  i'm trying to get a datepicker (using   -datepicker-rails gem ) to display via  simple_form  with    modal , but having no luck.    i've read a bunch of stuff such as:       -datepicker-rails/issues/51   how to setup  -datepicker-rails?     -date-picker-on-rails-so-simple/         all i get is a textfield but when i click on it there is no datepicker. could it be the datepicker is behind the modal, if so how to fix that?    my setup is as follows:     fyousuf$ rails -v rails 3.2.12  fyousuf$ ruby -v ruby 2.0.0p247 (2013-06-27 revision 41674) [x86_64-darwin12.3.0]       app/assets/stylesheets/application.css          *= require_self     *= require fullcalendar     *= require  -datepicker     *= require_tree .       app/assets/javascripts/application.js          //= require jquery     //= require jquery_ujs     //= require  /      //= require       //= require fullcalendar     //= require  -datepicker     //= require_tree .       app/assets/javascript/s/events.js           # place all the behaviors and hooks related to the matching controller here.     # all this logic will automatically be available in application.js.     # you can use coffeescript in this file:      $('[data-behaviour~=datepicker]').datepicker({"format": "yyyy-mm-dd", "weekstart": 1,      "autoclose": true});       app/views/events/_form.html.erb           %= simple_form_for(@event) do |f| %          ...          %= f.input :starts_at, :as =  :string, :input_html =  { data: {behaviour: "datepicker"}} %          ...      % end %
