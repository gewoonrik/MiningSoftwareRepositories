  2.3.0 navbar when collapsed will act like static-top even though declared fixed-top  i am using   2.3.0 without jquery. only angular.js and javascript.    i am having a problem right now:    my fixed-top navbar acts fine even when collapsed. but when it goes to collapse mode the navbar will leave its place at the top of the screen and will move down (something like 20-40 px). now after i checked it seems that i change the navbar to be navbar-static-top instead of navbar-fixed-top, the navbar will allways stay at position it went to when collapsed with fixed-top. so when collapsed it acts as if it was static-top??    anyways here's my code:      so the navbar will be collapsed.    i haven't made changes to  -responsive.css nor to  .css.    please save me, thanks.
