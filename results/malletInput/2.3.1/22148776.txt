conditional comments alternative in   3  i have a website that i am updating from   2.3.1 to 3.0.0.0    the current index.html uses quite a bit of conditional comments such as:      !--[if ie 7]   link href="font/fontello-ie7.css" rel="stylesheet"    ![endif]--       as far as i understand, conditional comments have been  depreciated .    so what is the current standard for such issues?  how should i be upgrading the above?
