Bootstrap button group gets button height wrong  I'm using the Bootstrap  ; other sizes display correctly.         The above is done with Chrome 27 on Mac OS X; Safari renders correctly while Firefox has the same problem but renders the button bigger at the bottom. Bootstrap version 2.3.1    My question: is this easily fixable?
