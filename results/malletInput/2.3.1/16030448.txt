convert a     uncloseable modal into a closeable one  i'm using     to create a modal that can't be closed. this is on purpose. however, after ten seconds, i want the user to be able to close the modal either by pressing the escape key or clicking outside of it. can this be done? here is sample code:      !doctype html   html lang="en"       head           meta charset="utf-8"           title  /title           link href="  cdn.com/ - /2.3.1/css/ -combined.min.css" rel="stylesheet"       /head       body           !-- button to trigger modal --           a href="#mymodal" role="button" class="btn" data-toggle="modal" launch demo modal /a            !-- modal --           div id="mymodal" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="mymodallabel" aria-hidden="true" data-backdrop="static" data-keyboard="false"               div class="modal-header"                   h3 id="mymodallabel" a modal that can't be closed /h3               /div               div class="modal-body"                   p there is no way to close this modal. i would like to make it so that after ten seconds, pressing the escape key or clicking outside the modal causes the modal to close. /p               /div           /div            script src=" "  /script           script src="  cdn.com/ - /2.3.1/js/ .min.js"  /script           script              $('#mymodal').on('shown', function() {                 settimeout(function() {                     alert('the modal has been open for 10 seconds.');                 }, 10000);             });          /script       /body   /html
