primefaces components rendering with     layout  i integrated     v2.3.1 in a primefaces v3.5 project,  i used   for layout and primefaces for components.    but i get a problem when using datatable, it does not render well as you can see in the picture:      by using firebug i figured out the problem, the default css of primefaces inputs get ovveridden by the   input styles    here are the stylesheets loaded in the order:         as you see the theme.css get ovveridden by  .css    so is there a way to load all primefaces stylesheets after thoose of  ? or is there any other solution to get correct rendering of primefaces componenets?
