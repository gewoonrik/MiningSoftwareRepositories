Primefaces components rendering with twitter   layout  I integrated Twitter Bootstrap v2.3.1 in a Primefaces v3.5 project,  I used Bootstrap for layout and Primefaces for components.    But I get a problem when using DataTable, it does not render well as you can see in the picture:      by using Firebug I figured out the problem, the default css of primefaces inputs get ovveridden by the Bootstrap input styles    here are the stylesheets loaded in the order:         as you see the theme.css get ovveridden by  .css    so is there a way to load all primefaces stylesheets after thoose of Bootstrap? or is there any other solution to get correct rendering of Primefaces componenets?
