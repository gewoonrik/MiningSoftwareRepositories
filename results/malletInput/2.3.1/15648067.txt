Auto Collapse/accordion on phones with CSS or JS  I read  this answer , but navbar option doesn't seem to fit my problem.    I use Twitter   2.3.1  I have a Frequently Asked Questions part in my website. It has too many question and answers.    So I need this:   In phones : Only title will be shown, text is collapsed. Text is visible after clicking an icon.   In tablet/desktop : Title and full text will be visible.    I have such code snippet:      with collapsed. But it doesn't seem a good solution.    I would be happy also if you can recommend another Twitter   option if there exists.    (It would be better also if user can see an arrow etc. to understand that the title can be collapsed/uncollapsed)
