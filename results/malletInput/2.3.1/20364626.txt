how to hover over/highlight .img-polaroid border in   similar to using .thumbnail class?  i am trying to figure out how to create a similar effect as the thumbnail effect in  , using the img-polaroid class extension.    i know that in the  .css file, there is the following code for the thumbnail extension:         but it doesn't highlight the border of the image with the img-polaroid class when hovering over the image, like you can do with the .thumbnail class in  ...    can anyone help me figure out how to do this? i know it would be easier to do it just using the .thumbnail class, but i am trying to experiment and see if my way of thinking would work too.    i am using   v2.3.1
