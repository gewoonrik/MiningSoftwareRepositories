How to hover over/highlight .img-polaroid border in Bootstrap similar to using .thumbnail class?  I am trying to figure out how to create a similar effect as the thumbnail effect in Bootstrap, using the img-polaroid class extension.    I know that in the Bootstrap.css file, there is the following code for the thumbnail extension:         but it doesn't highlight the border of the image with the img-polaroid class when hovering over the image, like you can do with the .thumbnail class in Bootstrap...    Can anyone help me figure out how to do this? I know it would be easier to do it just using the .thumbnail class, but I am trying to experiment and see if my way of thinking would work too.    I am using Bootstrap v2.3.1
