zeroclipboard events not firing  i am trying to use the latest version of the zeroclipboard plugin on a page in which the html is dynamically generated.  i have tried several different variations of implementing this, but all of them have the same overall effect.  i appear to end up with a page containing the flash elements because when i right-click over the appropriate element, i get the popup "about flash player" - but i also see in that same popup "movie not loaded"    i am using jquery 1.9.1 and     2.3.1.  my flash plugin is v11.7.700.202.  my web server is iis7.5    the code i use to dynamically generate the html is in a loop reading an array of user ids and looks like this:         using the chrome debugging tools, i can see the iteration through the loop creating new zeroclipboard objects for all my newly created objects and there are no uncaught exceptions but the alerts never happen so i am presuming the 'complete' event never fires    i'm sure i've made some simple noob mistake, but i just can't see it    all thoughts and suggestions gratefully received
