ZeroClipboard events not firing  I am trying to use the latest version of the ZeroClipboard plugin on a page in which the HTML is dynamically generated.  I have tried several different variations of implementing this, but all of them have the same overall effect.  I appear to end up with a page containing the flash elements because when I right-click over the appropriate element, I get the popup "About Flash Player" - but I also see in that same popup "Movie not loaded"    I am using JQuery 1.9.1 and Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.1.  My flash plugin is v11.7.700.202.  My web server is IIS7.5    The code I use to dynamically generate the HTML is in a loop reading an array of user IDs and looks like this:         Using the Chrome debugging tools, I can see the iteration through the loop creating new ZeroClipboard objects for all my newly created objects and there are no uncaught exceptions but the alerts never happen so I am presuming the 'complete' event never fires    I'm sure I've made some simple noob mistake, but I just can't see it    All thoughts and suggestions gratefully received
