zeroclipboard events not firing  i am trying to use the latest version of the zeroclipboard plugin on a page in which the html is dynamically generated.  i have tried several different variations of implementing this, but all of them have the same overall effect.  i appear to end up with a page containing the flash elements because when i right-click over the appropriate element, i get the popup "about flash player" - but i also see in that same popup "movie not loaded"    i am using jquery 1.9.1 and     2.3.1.  my flash plugin is v11.7.700.202.  my web server is iis7.5    the code i use to dynamically generate the html is in a loop reading an array of user ids and looks like this:     str=str+ ' span class="bmail_address" id=span-"'+   st.emailaddresses[i]+   '" data-clipboard-text="'+   st.emailaddresses[i]+   '@mydomain.com" '+   st.emailaddresses[i] +   "@mydomain.com nbsp; nbsp; /span ";      after looping through the array and outputtng the resultant string, i then try to add in the zeroclipboard stuff as follows:-     // bind zeroclipboard $('.bmail_address').each (function() {     // read text to copy from the data-clipboard-text attribute     var msg=$(this).attr('data-clipboard-text');      //create zerociplboard object     var clip = new zeroclipboard();      // set the text to copy     clip.settext(msg);      // setup event handlers     clip.on('complete', function (client, text) {         alert("copied: "+text+ "to clipboard");     });      clip.on( 'noflash', function ( client, args ) {         alert("you don't support flash");     });      // glue the object to the element        clip.glue($(this));   });      using the chrome debugging tools, i can see the iteration through the loop creating new zeroclipboard objects for all my newly created objects and there are no uncaught exceptions but the alerts never happen so i am presuming the 'complete' event never fires    i'm sure i've made some simple noob mistake, but i just can't see it    all thoughts and suggestions gratefully received
