where should i  erize my web site?  i want my site to be fluid/responsive to whatever device the user has; i reckon more often than not it will be a cell "phone," but i am developing on a laptop, so there's a mismatch between what i see at design time and what most users will see. of course, i can run emulators/simulators, etc. but my point is that i want the site to automatically adjust to the size/aspect ratio/orientation the device at any given moment. from what i've read, the easiest way to accomplish this is to leverage    s capabilities by referencing their css file and adding a few class declarations to various tags in my html. i'm wondering just where i need to add these.    i've added the   css:         so it uses "content-wrapper" on the outher divs and then floats inner tags left and right. does this obviate the need for    ? is the same sort of responsive design baked into this razor 2 structure already?    if not, in which tags should i put the     class declarations?     should i add class="row-fluid" to some of these tags and, if so, which ones?
