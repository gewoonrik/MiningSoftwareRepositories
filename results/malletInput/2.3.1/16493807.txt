where should i  erize my web site?  i want my site to be fluid/responsive to whatever device the user has; i reckon more often than not it will be a cell "phone," but i am developing on a laptop, so there's a mismatch between what i see at design time and what most users will see. of course, i can run emulators/simulators, etc. but my point is that i want the site to automatically adjust to the size/aspect ratio/orientation the device at any given moment. from what i've read, the easiest way to accomplish this is to leverage    s capabilities by referencing their css file and adding a few class declarations to various tags in my html. i'm wondering just where i need to add these.    i've added the   css:      link href="  cdn.com/ - /2.3.1/css/ -combined.no-icons.min.css" rel="stylesheet"       my _sitelayout.cshtml (razor 2 webiste) file came structured this way (showing just the body, head decapitated):      body       div id="fb-root"  /div       header           div class="content-wrapper"               div class="float-left"                   p class="site-title"                   /p               /div               div class="float-right"               /div           /div       /header       div id="body"           @rendersection("featured", required: false)          section class="content-wrapper main-content clear-fix"              @renderbody()          /section       /div       footer           div class="content-wrapper"               div class="float-left"                   p                   /p               /div           /div       /footer   /body       so it uses "content-wrapper" on the outher divs and then floats inner tags left and right. does this obviate the need for    ? is the same sort of responsive design baked into this razor 2 structure already?    if not, in which tags should i put the     class declarations?     should i add class="row-fluid" to some of these tags and, if so, which ones?
