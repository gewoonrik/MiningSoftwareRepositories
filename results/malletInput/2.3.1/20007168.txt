how to make a     modal footer always be visible on small screens?  using     2.3.1, what changes need to be made in order to force the footer (and its contents!) to always be shown, even on smaller screens? i would expect that on these smaller screens, the content in the   on a very small screen is being truncated, where i would expect the button within it to be shown completely, as in the second partial example.
