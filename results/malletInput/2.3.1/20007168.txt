how to make a     modal footer always be visible on small screens?  using     2.3.1, what changes need to be made in order to force the footer (and its contents!) to always be shown, even on smaller screens? i would expect that on these smaller screens, the content in the  modal-header  and  modal-footer  would always be shown, and the content of each fully shown, with only the contents of  modal-body  being scrollable.  modal-header  seems to behave this way currently, but  modal-footer  gets resized to the point that where on very small vertical-height screens, the footer is no longer even visible.    in this example, you can see that with a lot of  modal-body  content, the  modal-footer  on a very small screen is being truncated, where i would expect the button within it to be shown completely, as in the second partial example.
