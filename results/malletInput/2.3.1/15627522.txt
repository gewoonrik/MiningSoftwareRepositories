covering parts of a background image while other parts are transparent using css and html only  i am using     (ver 2.3.1) to build a website and i am trying to achieve the following:           on that website, i am using a large image as a background to a   section   which streches from the left edge of the screen to the right edge (all the way across).    i would like to place a pagination element on top of that image. with the navigation elements themselves being transparent (so the image below can shine throught) and the space left and right to the pagination element to be set in white color or page background color (it should cover the image, thats all).    i've given the pagination elements transparency:     .pagination li a, .pagination li span {     background: transparent; }      i simply do not know how to get the white spaces around the pagination.    can anyone help me out on this, please?!
