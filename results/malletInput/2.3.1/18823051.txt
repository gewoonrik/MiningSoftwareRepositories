ckeditor not initiating in ie 9  i'm using boostrap (2.3.1) modal to show forms (those are loaded with ajax). however, when i try to replace a textarea triggered by the "shown" event and      otherwise  only  the second time ie debugger shows the error that "document" is not set, pointing me to the following ( @ a.editable(new j(a,e.$.contentwindow.document.body)); ).    not quite sure what i am doing wrong here?       ckeditor not replacing on the first time seems to be an issue with the shown event. in ie the modal-body is still empty. i surrounded the each loop with a settimeout (300), and it seems to work (bit more testing required).       update: that did the trick.
