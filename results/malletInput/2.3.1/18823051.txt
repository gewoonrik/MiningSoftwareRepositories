ckeditor not initiating in IE 9  I'm using Boostrap (2.3.1) Modal to show forms (those are loaded with ajax). However, when i try to replace a textarea triggered by the "shown" event and      Otherwise  only  the second time ie debugger shows the error that "document" is not set, pointing me to the following ( @ a.editable(new j(a,e.$.contentWindow.document.body)); ).    Not quite sure what I am doing wrong here?       CKEDITOR not replacing on the first time seems to be an issue with the shown event. In ie the modal-body is still empty. I surrounded the each loop with a setTimeout (300), and it seems to work (bit more testing required).       Update: that did the trick.
