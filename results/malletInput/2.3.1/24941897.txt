Laravel 4 throwing MethodNotAllowedHttpException  I am making a simple registration form that then submits data to my database. However, the problem that I am running into is that the code that should submit the info to the database is not working.     Here's the form that I made using Twitter Bootstrap         I have double and triple checked to make sure that I am using the names and not the id's from my html form when I'm sending the data via POST and all my names from the columns in my database match the ones in my code. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
