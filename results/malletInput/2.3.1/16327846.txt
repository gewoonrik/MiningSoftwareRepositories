Bootstrap 3 compatible with current AngularJS   directives?   Will   3 release be compatible with current AngularJS   directives?     I want to use Bootstrap 2.3.1 directive with AngularJS:       /     With the Bootstrap 3.0.0 CSS:       /tree/3.0.0-wip/      Why?      AngularJS team is still working on JS directives for v2.3.1 and will need time to catch up to v3.0.0. I want to start using v3 CSS grid syntax now.       /issues/331
