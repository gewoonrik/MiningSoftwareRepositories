installing     with rails  i am trying to install on an existing project        i tried to do that, following  this  :      group :assets do   gem ' -sass-rails' end      and i got that :     bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "actionpack":   in gemfile:      -sass-rails ( = 0) java depends on       actionpack (~  3.1.0) java      rails (= 2.3.14) java depends on       actionpack (2.3.14)  bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "rails":   in gemfile:      -sass-rails ( = 0) java depends on       rails (~  3.1.3) java      rails (2.3.14)      knowing that when i run rails -v, i get rails 3.2.12. so, following the doc, i tried this     gem install  -sass-rails    i am told that the gem is successfully installed but i don't see any new file in my app folder. by the way, i tried to add in one of my stylesheet this     **/*  *= require  /   */ **      but no   css seems to be called on my layouts. could someone help ? is this the right way to install   ?    update : i have just noticed that in the gem file i have : gem "rails", "2.3.14"
