Bootstrap popover never work for me  I have problem with   popover, and I have always been confused about that, even after I read some post on stackoverflow. Here is my complete code, and the popover does not work. I have no idea why. Could anybody help me?          One more question that I want to ask is, when we want to use popover, tooltips function in  , do we need to include the file " -tooltips.js" and " -popover.js" as our js source? Or we just need to include " .min.js" only?    Really appreciate it.
