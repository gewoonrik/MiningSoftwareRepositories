how to debug jquery $.proxy event listeners?   technology     i am using jquery 1.9.1 and     2.3.1     context     i am currently facing a bug in the     typeahead plugin that prevents you from entering in a " " character in a input[type="text"] when the autocomplete drop down is open (ampersand is returning keycode 38, up arrow is keycode 38).     i want to be able to look through all of the events that are attached to the input[type="text"] and figure out what is causing the problem.      problem           questions       is there anyway to obtain the  function scope  and  closure  context out of a javascript function?   is there an easier way of debugging what $.proxy event listeners are fired on a dom element using jquery?   is there a better way of debugging these events?      thanks!
