How to debug jQuery $.proxy event listeners?   Technology     I am using jQuery 1.9.1 and twitter   2.3.1     Context     I am currently facing a bug in the twitter   typeahead plugin that prevents you from entering in a " " character in a input[type="text"] when the autocomplete drop down is open (Ampersand is returning keycode 38, Up arrow is keycode 38).     I want to be able to look through all of the events that are attached to the input[type="text"] and figure out what is causing the problem.      Problem           Questions       Is there anyway to obtain the  function scope  and  closure  context out of a javascript function?   Is there an easier way of debugging what $.proxy event listeners are fired on a DOM element using jQuery?   Is there a better way of debugging these events?      Thanks!
