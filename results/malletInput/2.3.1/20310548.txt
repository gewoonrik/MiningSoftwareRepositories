  and   tag - event not firing first time- ipad only  we are using     to pop up some modal windows and use some ajax calls. one problem we have run into concerns ipad devices.     we have this button:         when a purchase code is entered, we do a ajax lookup to see if the code is empty, malformed or otherwise valid. our script.asp performs the lookup against a database and returns the appropriate code e.g. badcode in the case of a non-existent purchase code.    on ipad devices the click event does not fire until the button is clicked twice. on desktop browsers the code works perfectly. is there a workaround, or is it a known bug? we have tried with   2.3.1 and 2.3.2.
