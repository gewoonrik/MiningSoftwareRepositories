  2.3.1 popover causing parent modal to close  i'm running into an issue where i'm displaying some data in a   modal. this data contains an icon which i'm turning into a popover.  when i hover over the icon, the popover displays and everything works correctly, but when i mouse away from the icon, not only does the popover close, but the parent modal closes also.    i think this is the same issue as described  here .  however, the posted solution does not work for me.  i'm capturing the popover's "hidden" event, but neither setting e.cancelbubble = true or calling e.stoppropagation() stops the parent modal from closing.    i don't have my code in front of me at the moment, but here is a rough mockup based on my general recollection...    html         !-- ko with: myfoo --   div class="modal hide fade" data-bind="visible: isopen"       div class="modal-header"           button type="button" class="close" data-bind="click: close"  times; /button           h3 title bar! /h3       /div       div class="modal-body"           !-- dynamically generated modal content goes here, including... --           table               tr                   td data-bind="popover: $data"                       i class="icon-question-mark" data-content="la la la..." /                   /td               /tr           /table       /div       div class="modal-footer"           a href="#" class="btn" data-bind="click: close" close /a       /div   /div   !-- /ko --          knockout custom binding handler        ko.bindinghandlers.popover = {      init: function(element)     {         $(element).children().andself().on("mousenter", "[data-content]"function() {             var options = {...}             $(this).popover(options).on("hidden", function(e) {                 e.cancelbubble = true;                 e.stoppropagation();             });         });     } };      does anyone have any ideas / suggestions on how to fix this?
