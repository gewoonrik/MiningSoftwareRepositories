Bootstrap 2.3.1 popover causing parent modal to close  I'm running into an issue where I'm displaying some data in a Bootstrap modal. This data contains an icon which I'm turning into a popover.  When I hover over the icon, the popover displays and everything works correctly, but when I mouse away from the icon, not only does the popover close, but the parent modal closes also.    I think this is the same issue as described  here .  However, the posted solution does not work for me.  I'm capturing the popover's "hidden" event, but neither setting e.cancelBubble = true or calling e.stopPropagation() stops the parent modal from closing.    I don't have my code in front of me at the moment, but here is a rough mockup based on my general recollection...    HTML            Does anyone have any ideas / suggestions on how to fix this?
