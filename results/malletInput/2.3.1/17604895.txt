  2.3.1 popover causing parent modal to close  i'm running into an issue where i'm displaying some data in a   modal. this data contains an icon which i'm turning into a popover.  when i hover over the icon, the popover displays and everything works correctly, but when i mouse away from the icon, not only does the popover close, but the parent modal closes also.    i think this is the same issue as described  here .  however, the posted solution does not work for me.  i'm capturing the popover's "hidden" event, but neither setting e.cancelbubble = true or calling e.stoppropagation() stops the parent modal from closing.    i don't have my code in front of me at the moment, but here is a rough mockup based on my general recollection...    html            does anyone have any ideas / suggestions on how to fix this?
