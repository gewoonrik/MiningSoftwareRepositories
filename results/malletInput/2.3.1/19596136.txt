loading google map into   modal  inserting a google map into a   modal is giving me the 'gray box' result, and i don't see the issue.    i thought i'd fire the model('show'), then load the map on('shown') to avoid the conflicts talked about here  showing a google map in a modal created with          any help greatly appreciated
