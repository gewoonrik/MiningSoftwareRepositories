Twitter   popover is broken   Note:        Jquery  1.9.1    Bootstrap  2.3.1    WordPress  3.6 Beta 1 - This issue only happens in WordPress 3.6 Beta      It seems that popovers are broken in the latest version of wordpress, I have the html for the element with the popover attached, along with the jquery that makes the popover work.     image            In case you can't see it, the arrow for the pop over is moved to left and practically opaque     HTML for that particular element:          I don't know what else to show you as I cant give you admin access to my WordPress "live" dev environment.      Can some one tell me whats going on?
