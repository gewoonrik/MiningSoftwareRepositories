how to include css style to modify existing placeholder  this question is very related with  this one , but after reading and trying the different jsfiddles i cannot make it work in my case.    i have an existing source base which has   2.3.1 and less. at the time being i cannot modify or recompile less, i can only modify existing html and use inline styles.     is it possible to include this:     ::-webkit-input-placeholder { /* webkit browsers */     color:    #999; } :-moz-placeholder { /* mozilla firefox 4 to 18 */     color:    #999; } ::-moz-placeholder { /* mozilla firefox 19+ */     color:    #999; } :-ms-input-placeholder { /* internet explorer 10+ */     color:    #999; }      in a simple input field with a placeholder like this:      input id="some_id" placeholder="lorem ipsum rocks da house!"/       i've tried something similar to this  jsfiddle  with some success (i'm able to change font-size only) but i've read that   with less has a  mixin  for placeholder that i think is interfering with this method. actually, if i refresh, i can see for a fraction of a second the style specified inline, but then suddenly changes to what i think is specified in that mixin.    any ideas how to overcome this?    thanks!
