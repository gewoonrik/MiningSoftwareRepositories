how to include css style to modify existing placeholder  This question is very related with  this one , but after reading and trying the different jsfiddles I cannot make it work in my case.    I have an existing source base which has   2.3.1 and LESS. At the time being I cannot modify or recompile LESS, I can only modify existing HTML and use inline styles.     Is it possible to include this:         I've tried something similar to this  jsfiddle  with some success (I'm able to change font-size only) but I've read that   with LESS has a  mixin  for placeholder that I think is interfering with this method. Actually, if I refresh, I can see for a fraction of a second the style specified inline, but then suddenly changes to what I think is specified in that mixin.    Any ideas how to overcome this?    Thanks!
