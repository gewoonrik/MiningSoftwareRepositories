karma runner > loading  .js before angular and angular-mocks throws exception  i have an angularjs app with some directives which make use of jquery and   components. so, in order to test the directives, i have defined the following order of files in karma.unit.conf.js:      repeats endlessly about a 15k times before the test fails (it seems to be happening when jquery tries to execute the internaldata function at jquery.js:1763).     any idea would be appreciated     edit: solved    found the answer, it was a   issue in version 2.3.0, updating to 2.3.1 solved it. see    / /issues/6835
