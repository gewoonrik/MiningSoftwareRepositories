Karma Runner > Loading  .js before angular and angular-mocks throws exception  I have an angularjs app with some directives which make use of jquery and   components. So, in order to test the directives, I have defined the following order of files in karma.unit.conf.js:      repeats endlessly about a 15k times before the test fails (it seems to be happening when jQuery tries to execute the internalData function at jquery.js:1763).     Any idea would be appreciated     Edit: Solved    Found the answer, it was a   issue in version 2.3.0, updating to 2.3.1 solved it. See    /issues/6835
