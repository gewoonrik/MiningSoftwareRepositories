wmode=transparent for Youtube video Iframe not working in IE with   modal  I have a web app in which I am embedding Youtube videos using the iframe tag. I am also using   modal. So the issue arises in IE when the   modal fails to overlap the youtube video. Now i googled for this and I found a lot of answers saying that adding wmode=transparent should fix the issue. Well, It did not for me.    Since I couldnt figure out a way for setting up a jsfiddle, I went to the   modal demo site and edited their code and added a youtube video. Please refer the below screenshot for more details.         And when I clicked on the "Launch demo modal", it did not work         Can anyone explain why this is not working or have a solution for this?    Here is the youtube video code which i put just above that modal button         I am using:      IE 9      modal version 2.3.1     Youtube API version 2
