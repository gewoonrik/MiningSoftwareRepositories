cannot run playframwork 2.1 integrationspec with     js  i have a playframework (2.1) project with  .js included in the main.scala.html file, whenever i run the 'test' command from the console, the whole process hangs. its strange because i have no problem when using the 'run' command.    this is really easy to reproduce:      create  a new playframework 2.1 scala project.   add  .js or  .min.js to the public/javascripts folder   add a script tag in main.scala.html directly after the existing jquery include   enter the play console   run the 'test' command      the applicationspec will run if it happens to get called first but the integrationspec will never run and the console waits until killed.    i'm using playframework 2.1,   2.3.1, java 1.6.0_43 and scala 2.10.0. i get the same problem on ubuntu 12.10 and windows 7.    i haven't changed the applicationspec or integrationspec files from what gets generated by 'play new'. the only thing i've changed is adding the  .js file to the javascripts directory and adding the script entry to the main.scala.html. eveything else is a newly created, standard, play 2 scala application.    can anyone else verify if this is an issue (or just me) and what the problem might be?
