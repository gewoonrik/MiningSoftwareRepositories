Angular ng-repeat not working with deep linking  I've got an interesting problem happening for me in Angular that I can't seem to find a solution for.    Here is the source:        Basically I am using an ng-repeat to create a vertical sidebar that deep links to a certain part of the page. Now, I've tested the generated code statically, and it works so maybe I'm not doing something right.    Heres is the code, in case you don't want to go to Plunker.    index.html         Any idea why this might be happening?
