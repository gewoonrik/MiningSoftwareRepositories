angularjs datepicker not displaying totally on   3 collapse/accordion  i'm working with   3 and the angularjs ui.  i've integrated a datepicker into an accordion, but it doesn't show over/outside the accordion body in itself.     i found a reference on the same problem and the solution ( here ), but it's with   2.3.1 and after trying the .collapse{ position:inherited; } solution on my code and trying to override the z-index, it's still not working.    here's  a plunker with the problem on 2.3.1  so you can understand the problem, and my current code. any ideas on what's causing the problem?
