AngularJS Datepicker not displaying totally on Bootstrap 3 Collapse/Accordion  I'm working with Bootstrap 3 and the AngularJS UI.  I've integrated a Datepicker into an accordion, but it doesn't show over/outside the accordion body in itself.     I found a reference on the same problem and the solution ( here ), but it's with Bootstrap 2.3.1 and after trying the .collapse{ position:inherited; } solution on my code and trying to override the z-index, it's still not working.    Here's  a Plunker with the problem on 2.3.1  so you can understand the problem, and my current code. Any ideas on what's causing the problem?
