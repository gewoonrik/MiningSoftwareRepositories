angularjs datepicker not displaying totally on   3 collapse/accordion  i'm working with   3 and the angularjs ui.  i've integrated a datepicker into an accordion, but it doesn't show over/outside the accordion body in itself.     i found a reference on the same problem and the solution ( here ), but it's with   2.3.1 and after trying the .collapse{ position:inherited; } solution on my code and trying to override the z-index, it's still not working.    here's  a plunker with the problem on 2.3.1  so you can understand the problem, and my current code. any ideas on what's causing the problem?      div class="row ix-advanced"       div class="panel-group col-md-12" id="accordion"           div class="panel panel-default"               div id="advancedsearch" class="panel-collapse collapse"                   div class="panel-body"                       form class="form-inline" role="form"                         div class="form-group col-md-1"                           label  ?php echo _t('date')?  /label  br /                           input type="text" class="form-control input-sm" datepicker-popup="dd-mm-yyyy" ng-model="dt" is-open="opened" min="mindate" max="'2015-06-22'" datepicker-options="dateoptions" date-disabled="disabled(date, mode)" ng-required="true" placeholder=" ?php echo _t('from')?
