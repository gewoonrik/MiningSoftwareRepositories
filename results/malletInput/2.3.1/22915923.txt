Stop wrapping content at mobile sizes  I'm using   and I wish to have a logo on the left and a logo on the right of my page, in the same row.    But when the page is down to mobile size, I don't want the logos to wrap. One should still be on the left and the other on the right.    What is the best way to achieve this? Put both logo's in a span 12, or put each one in a span 6? But then how do I stop them wrapping at mobile?    Im using v.2.3.1
