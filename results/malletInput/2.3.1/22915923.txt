stop wrapping content at mobile sizes  i'm using   and i wish to have a logo on the left and a logo on the right of my page, in the same row.    but when the page is down to mobile size, i don't want the logos to wrap. one should still be on the left and the other on the right.    what is the best way to achieve this? put both logo's in a span 12, or put each one in a span 6? but then how do i stop them wrapping at mobile?    im using v.2.3.1
