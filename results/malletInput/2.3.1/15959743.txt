IE & Twitter Bootstrap (navbar + form elements) -- natural enemies?  So this one is bugging me out    I have a new layout using twitter   that is supposed to look like         but in IE 7/8/9/10 looks like      the top navbar is fixed position, I've tried adding both padding   margin to the top  tag neither of which is recognized - I'm using   2.3.1 though had the same issues with previous versions    any ideas besides chromeframe?    the site can be viewed at        (just realized that I uploaded a screenshot of the homepage from chrome   the blog from IE though the issue stands for both pages) screenshot of blog in chrome::
