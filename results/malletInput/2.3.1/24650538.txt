Bootstrap Modal - show does not remove hide attribute  I am creating a Bootstrap 2.3.1 modal as follows:      events do occur however. From looking at the   code, the fact that the shown event occurs means that the event is not prevented from default behaviour.     Note  This is a question similar to one I posted earlier, but I have added some more information concerning how it fails.    Please also note that I cannot update to  Bootstrap 3 . I am responsible for making small changes to an already released product and a change of basic libraries is a non-starter.
