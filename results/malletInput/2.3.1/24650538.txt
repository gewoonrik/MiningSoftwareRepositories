  modal - show does not remove hide attribute  i am creating a   2.3.1 modal as follows:      events do occur however. from looking at the   code, the fact that the shown event occurs means that the event is not prevented from default behaviour.     note  this is a question similar to one i posted earlier, but i have added some more information concerning how it fails.    please also note that i cannot update to    3 . i am responsible for making small changes to an already released product and a change of basic libraries is a non-starter.
