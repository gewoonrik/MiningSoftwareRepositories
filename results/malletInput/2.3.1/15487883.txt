Bootstrap tabbable nav does not display expected tab in Ruby on Rails  I am developing based on this Gemfile:         The effect is not what's expected (even if it works fine on their site, and I copy/paste it):    -When first displaying the page, active tab 1 is selected (as expected)    -When I click on 'Section 2' tab, the address bar actually displays the URL ...#tab2, but not the content of section 2. Active tab is still 1.    -When I click on 'Section 1' tab, the address bar actually displays the URL ...#tab1     What did I miss ?     Thanks for your help.    Best regards,    Fred
