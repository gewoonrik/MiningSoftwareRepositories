Bootstrap code in an iframe is not rendered properly  Below is simple html page with an iframe. Inside this iframe are some fluid rows. The problem is now that the content in the iframe is stacked but it should be on the same row. There is enough space for "label" and "main content" to be on the same line.    Here is the code of the main page:          The result is now:   label  main content  label 1  main content 1       instead of   label     main content  label 1   main content 1      Does somebody know how can I achieve the desired result?
