Fix spacing around an image using the .thumbnail class in Bootstrap?  I am using   v2.3.1, and I am trying to understand how to fix one of my images.    In the example image link below, the top image is what I want all the images to look like when the screen is resized to it's smallest size (cellphone size), and the bottom image is what's giving me an issue:           For some reason it has more space on the sides of the 2nd image than it should have.    (NOTE: My screenshot is altered to show both the correct image and the wrong image. The code below is what I am actually using)    My code is this:         So I don't know if it's an issue with one of the settings in the CSS file, but since I am using the .thumbnail class, I'm guessing it has to do with that?    Does anyone know how to make it so that I don't get all that extra space around my images when using the .thumbnail class?
