fix spacing around an image using the .thumbnail class in  ?  i am using   v2.3.1, and i am trying to understand how to fix one of my images.    in the example image link below, the top image is what i want all the images to look like when the screen is resized to it's smallest size (cellphone size), and the bottom image is what's giving me an issue:           for some reason it has more space on the sides of the 2nd image than it should have.    (note: my screenshot is altered to show both the correct image and the wrong image. the code below is what i am actually using)    my code is this:      section       ul class="thumbnails"           li               a class="thumbnail" rel="group" href="images/r1.jpg"                   img src="images/thumbnails/r1s.jpg" alt="" /               /a           /li           li               a class="thumbnail" rel="group" href="images/r2.jpg"                   img src="images/thumbnails/r2s.jpg" alt="" /               /a           /li       /ul   /section       so i don't know if it's an issue with one of the settings in the css file, but since i am using the .thumbnail class, i'm guessing it has to do with that?    does anyone know how to make it so that i don't get all that extra space around my images when using the .thumbnail class?
