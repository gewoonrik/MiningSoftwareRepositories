    nav-stacked css not working  i am trying to achieve the stackable effect as shown here:  http:// .github.com/ /components.html#navs     but somehow it is not working for me. here is the link to a plunk that i have created:     it just shows three list items one below another without the navbar effect of  .      !doctype html   html   head       link href="//netdna. cdn.com/ - /2.3.1/css/ -combined.min.css" rel="stylesheet"       script src="//netdna. cdn.com/ - /2.3.1/js/ .min.js"  /script    /head    body       div class="row-fluid"           div class="offset4 span4"               ul class="nav nav-tabs nav-stacked"                   li  item1 /li                   li  item2 /li                   li  item3 /li               /ul           /div       /div   /body   /html       i must be doing some blunder that something as simple as nav-stacked is not working. would be glad and grateful if someone could point out my mistake.
