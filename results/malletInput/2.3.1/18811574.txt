asp.net mvc 5 and   3  been looking around the nets for a bit more information but couldn't find much.    so i have created a new mvc 5 project in  vs 2013 rc  which comes pre-installed with    2.3.1     everything works like a charm, but since    3  is out (and me wanting to use the  less  version and not  pre-compiled css ) i removed    2.3.1  from  nuget  and installed    less .    i know the folder structure is slightly different, but i have edited my  bundleconfig  to accommodate for that. everything seems to compile fine, all the js are there, but when trying to view the web page it looks messed up.    does    3  have completely different  html  template (i.e. do i need to change  _layout  ?) or should the  _layout  that came with  2.3.1  work with  v3  as well?    i hope my question is clear.
