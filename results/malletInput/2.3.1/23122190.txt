how to implement   3 into a single-page in a huge enterprise app built on   2.3.1  i just want to know if i import   3 on my page, would it just extend the   or would it cause a conflict in the   2.3.1 page and issues occur when i go back to a 2.3.1 page?      link href=" -3.1.0"/       if so, is there a way around it by unloading css once route is not on my page any more?    my goal is to make my module responsive and not affect how the main application performs.
