  - popover gets cut off by modal header  i am using a popover inside a modal window in   2.3.1.  the problem is that the popover displays under the modal-header div.      you can see an example / fiddle of this problem here: ("launch demo modal", then "click to toggle popover")        the relevant code is:      a class="btn" data-content="and here's some amazing content.  it's very engaging.     right? and another thing about this is a that it's really long.  when i say long i mean really, really long."  rel="popover"  href="#" data-original-title="a title"  click to toggle popover  /a       *i modified a fiddle created by cvrebert from this thread on github    /issues/5014
