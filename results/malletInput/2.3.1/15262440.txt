    tab selection not changing content  although there are plenty of     questions open that regard similar issues to that which i'm having, i haven't been able to find any solutions to my particular issue.  i'm using the    s "tab" feature in order to display content, and while the script succeeds in changing the changing the active tab, the content remains the same.    here's the code:         all the dependence files are loaded just fine when i run this (for reference, the version of   being used is 2.3.1).  i've been head-desking about this problem for quite some time now, so any help would be greatly appreciated.    edit:  here's  a jsfiddle link containing the error code.
