  sass gem conflicts between versions 2&3  i'm using   -sass  gem in my rails project with version 2.3.1.0. however, when pushed up to heroku, i'm getting the   3 styles. i inspect the css style and it indeed does say   version 3.    on local, the assignment seems to be correct. but equally perplexing, when i inspect the css file, it says   version 3 despite displaying what looks like the   2.3 styles.    i think at one point, my   -sass  gem was using the   3, but when i put it back to  gem ' -sass', '2.3.1.0' , i'm getting this strange conflict. i really just want my heroku app to display the styles correctly. even though i'm pushing up my current local version to heroku, it is still using   3 stylings.    here's what i've got:     gemfile :     group :assets do     gem 'sass-rails',   '~  3.2.3'     gem 'coffee-rails', '~  3.2.1'     gem 'uglifier', ' = 1.0.3'     gem ' -sass', '2.3.1.0' end      i've created a  styles.css.scss  file, where i have the line  @import " "; here's what it looks like on localhost:         here's what it looks like on heroku:
