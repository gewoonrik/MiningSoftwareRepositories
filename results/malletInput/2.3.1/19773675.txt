angularjs socket.io   modals only once  i have a problem with   modal window when using angularjs together with nodejs and socket.io. i have been googling and it seems like it is issue that has a solution, but for some reason it doesn't work when i am trying to implement it together with socket.io. i used modals on two different places - when i click on a static div (works perfectly), when i receive a message from websockets (opens only once and then nothing). i guess i might have a problem in my js code since the modal when i click on a static div works fine, but i don't know.    i have an address and i am sending some data via websockets to the client when this link is visited. the client event looks like this:         i am using angularjs 1.0.7,   css 2.3.1
