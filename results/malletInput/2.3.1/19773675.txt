AngularJS socket.IO Bootstrap Modals only once  I have a problem with   modal window when using AngularJS together with NodeJS and socket.io. I have been googling and it seems like it is issue that has a solution, but for some reason it doesn't work when I am trying to implement it together with Socket.io. I used modals on two different places - when I click on a static div (works perfectly), when I receive a message from webSockets (opens only once and then nothing). I guess I might have a problem in my JS code since the modal when I click on a static div works fine, but I don't know.    I have an address and I am sending some data via WebSockets to the client when this link is visited. The client event looks like this:         I am using AngularJS 1.0.7, Bootstrap CSS 2.3.1
