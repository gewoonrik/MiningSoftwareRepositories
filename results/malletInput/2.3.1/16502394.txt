AddressPicker with Bootstrap  I would like to use the addresspicker here     to auto complete an address form that I am developing.    I am totally new to web development and have started using twitter   with a couple of query plugins for form validation and a datepicker which is working fine, but have not idea how to incorporate the addresspicker into my page so I can use the callback function to populate the address part of my form.    Could someone help me or point me in the right direction. I have also come across this example,    , but it does not include the form section.    Here is my code so far:         Many Thanks for any help you can give me... Luke
