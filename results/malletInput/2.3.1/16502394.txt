addresspicker with    i would like to use the addresspicker here     to auto complete an address form that i am developing.    i am totally new to web development and have started using     with a couple of query plugins for form validation and a datepicker which is working fine, but have not idea how to incorporate the addresspicker into my page so i can use the callback function to populate the address part of my form.    could someone help me or point me in the right direction. i have also come across this example,    , but it does not include the form section.    here is my code so far:         many thanks for any help you can give me... luke
