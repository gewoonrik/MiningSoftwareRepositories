not getting openntf project:   for xpages to work  running on ibm domino r9.0 social edition    installed in the client, verified that the files exists at the proper location. installed on the server, same here.    if i do:  tell http osgi ss org.openntf.   it says resolved    under xsp properties i have both the extension library and   checked.    all this in an otherwise empty database. set the theme manually (because it doesn't exist in the dropdown) to   v2.3.1  create an empty xpage, clean and build all.    if i open the xpage in a web browser the end result is:      "the application /test.nsf requires org.openntf.xsp. .library. this library cannot be found."     what am i missing?    thanks!    /j
