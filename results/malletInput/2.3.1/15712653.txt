centering text with   2.3.1  from searching around, i know this question has been asked before and i just... don't understand what is going wrong here.    i have tried about a million different angles and just can't get my text to center.    if anyone has any idea what the deal is and would like to let me know, that would be great.      div class="row-fluid text-center"       h1 class="span12" foobar's contacts /h1   /div       among other things, i already tried moving the  text-center  class to the  h1  element.    edit: i was able to change it to this and center the header. any drawbacks to this approach?      div class="offset4 span4 text-center"       h1 class="span8" foobar's contacts /h1   /div
