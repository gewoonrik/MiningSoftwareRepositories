what ressources are necessary for compiling  .css from  .less?  for a project i'm working on i wanted to use a customized version of  . after playing around with it it seemed quite clear to me, how   works. there is a central .less file,  .less, which bundles in all the other .less files fullfilling certain tasks. my plan was to adapt  .less and variables.less, which would have been sufficient fo my purpose.    so i did download the complete less folder of the     git repository at     /tree/master/less     and i installed less.app for mac os x, set all   files to be watched and only  .css to be recompiled each time i changed any .less file. up to this point i did not change any of the files, but did recompile  .less, which gave me a new  .css    now my problem is, that the newly compiled  .css (compiled from the unchanged files downloaded from the   git repository) looks completely different from the  .css that comes with the   download, and it behaves different as well.     .css directly downloaded starts like this:     /*!  *   v2.3.1  *  * copyright 2012  , inc  * licensed under the apache license v2.0  *   *  * designed and built with all the love in the world @  by @mdo and @fat.  */  .clearfix {   *zoom: 1; }  .clearfix:before,      and the same 15 lines in  .css compiled from the unchanged  .less looks like this:     /*! normalize.css v2.1.3 | mit license | git.io/normalize */ article, aside, details, figcaption, figure, footer, header, hgroup, main, nav, section, summary {   display: block; }       .less looks like this (first 15 lines only):     // core variables and mixins @import "variables.less"; @import "mixins.less";  // reset @import "normalize.less"; @import "print.less";  // core css @import "scaffolding.less";  @import "type.less"; @import "code.less"; @import "grid.less"; @import "tables.less";      and there is a lot more differences, completely different behaviour and no idea why this is happening. so heres my questions:      should compiling like i describe work?   are there some important ressources i did miss?      i'd be glad for every little tip helping to find a solution to this...
