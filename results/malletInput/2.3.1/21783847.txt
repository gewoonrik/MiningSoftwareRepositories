three columns horizontal form resize issue -   v2.3.1  i'm trying to create a 3 columns form (each column will have a label and an input text and it could be multiple rows).    the issue i'm having is there are some cases when the screen is resized and label and field overlaps; also the horizontal scroll bar is displayed, see below:         see html sample         i've tried using "container", "container-fluid", "row", "row-fluid" any hint on what i'm doing wrong?
