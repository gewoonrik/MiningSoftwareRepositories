Three columns horizontal form resize issue - Bootstrap v2.3.1  I'm trying to create a 3 columns Form (each column will have a label and an input text and it could be multiple rows).    The issue I'm having is there are some cases when the screen is resized and label and field overlaps; also the horizontal scroll bar is displayed, see below:         See HTML sample         I've tried using "container", "container-fluid", "row", "row-fluid" Any hint on what I'm doing wrong?
