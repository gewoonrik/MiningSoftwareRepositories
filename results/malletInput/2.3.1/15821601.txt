Twitter Bootstrap, affix, how to have nav stay static at the top in mobile layout  The twitter   docs site, the left nav gets fixed to the top in a mobile layout.  ex:    /javascript.html     I want to do the same without using the ...docs.css as is done in the Bootstrap site.     Currently, the issue that I'm facing is that the 'affix nav' stays on top of the content in mobile dimensions as you scroll through the content.                     I want the 'affix nav' to get fixed to the top in a mobile layout with using the latest   v2.3.1. How do I go about it? Any suggestions?
