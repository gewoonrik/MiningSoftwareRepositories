does resharper tell me a css class is unknown because it's on a cdn?  resharper tells me, " unknown css class 'container-fluid " for this line in my site's _sitelayout.cshtml file:         ...and i believe "container-fluid' is there. is this simply a matter of resharper not being able to find the class because it's remote?
