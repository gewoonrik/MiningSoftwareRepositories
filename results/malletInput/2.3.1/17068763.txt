Does Resharper tell me a css class is unknown because it's on a CDN?  Resharper tells me, " Unknown css class 'container-fluid " for this line in my site's _SiteLayout.cshtml file:         ...and I believe "container-fluid' is there. Is this simply a matter of Resharper not being able to find the class because it's remote?
