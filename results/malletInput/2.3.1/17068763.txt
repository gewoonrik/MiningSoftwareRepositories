does resharper tell me a css class is unknown because it's on a cdn?  resharper tells me, " unknown css class 'container-fluid " for this line in my site's _sitelayout.cshtml file:      header class="container-fluid" "      i do have this in my  head  section:      link href="  cdn.com/ - /2.3.1/css/ -combined.no-icons.min.css" rel="stylesheet"       ...and i believe "container-fluid' is there. is this simply a matter of resharper not being able to find the class because it's remote?
