vertically aligning images to the bottom inside a   "row"?  in the following example :        i have 3 images inside a  row , i want to align the images to the bottom of the  row .     i tried other methods like making the outer division position  relative  and that of the image absolute and then  bottom: 0  but it doesn't work since i'm using   (2.3.1).    i know that there are many other similar questions like mine viz  this  but none of the solutions work with mine.     how do i vertically align these images to the bottom of the  row ?    thanks
