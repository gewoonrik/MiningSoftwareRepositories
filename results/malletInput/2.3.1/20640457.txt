post_content in wp-  & category widget  i've got a couple of issues with wordpress and wp-  at the moment.    first issue is on a page of category-filtered posts i get 5 lines taken from the post and then a "read more" like this:        a great day out for all the family. whether you are visiting the race track for any of their various events, meandering through the many pathways, just popping around to feed the ducks, there is always domething to do. children just love adventuring through the trees, having quiet time spying the variety of woodland birdsâ€¦ read more â»      anyone got any ideas how to reduce the text from five lines to two? i presume it's based on a certain number of characters? i've had a look but couldn't see anything obvious but i suspect i've been looking in the wrong places....    the other thing that's been driving me crazy is i've added a widget (standard wordpress fare) at the bottom of the page to let users select posts by category. it brings up a drop down menu which when the page loads (ie. before the user tries to do anything) says "select category". i'd like to change this if at all possible so any   all suggestions welcome.    if you need it i'm running wp 3.8 and wp-  2.3.1.    thanks,    ross
