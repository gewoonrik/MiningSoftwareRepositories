jquery undefined when running script in console  i have an issue with a piece of script i am running which is suppose to populate this modal:      div class="modal hide fade" id="modal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="mymodallabel" aria-hidden="true"         div class="modal-header"           button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true" ã— /button           h3 id="mymodallabel" latest updates! /h3         /div         div class="modal-body"         /div        div class="modal-footer"           button class="btn" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true" close /button        /div          /div         the code is:     (function($){     $(document).ready(function(){           $('a.updatenotes').on('click', function(e) {             e.preventdefault();             var url = $(this).attr('href');             $(".modal-body").html(' iframe width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="yes" allowtransparency="true" src="'+url+'"  /iframe ');         });     }); })(jquery);      the issue is that when i run that code in the console of chrome i get "undefined" yet there are no actual console errors on the code it's self. that is when the page loads the code throws no issues, but if i run it in the console i get "undefined" can some one tell me what i am doing wrong? the link that creates this, is:      a data-toggle="modal" class="btn btn-success" href=" "  data-target="#modal"      learn more!  /a       if you go to that actual link, you'll see content that i should see in the box. also will the box expand to fit the content? that is expand to a specific width then scroll for anything longer?     jquery 1.9.latest,     2.3.1      note:  the reason the jquery is wrapped in  (function($){})(jquery)  is because of wordpress and how it deals with jquery, it doesn't like the $ because of other script's it uses.     upade  jquery version 1.9.1 is being loaded in the header of the page. clicking the link to the source takes me to the jquery 1.9.1 source. while the code shown above is apart of the html file it's self, how ever it is "executed"  after  the loading of jquery 1.9.1
