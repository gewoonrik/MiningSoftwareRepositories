jquery undefined when running script in console  i have an issue with a piece of script i am running which is suppose to populate this modal:      is because of wordpress and how it deals with jquery, it doesn't like the $ because of other script's it uses.     upade  jquery version 1.9.1 is being loaded in the header of the page. clicking the link to the source takes me to the jquery 1.9.1 source. while the code shown above is apart of the html file it's self, how ever it is "executed"  after  the loading of jquery 1.9.1
