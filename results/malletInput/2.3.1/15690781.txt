    popover trigger for desktop and mobile platforms  default  popover  trigger option is click. but i need to change it to hover. it can be done like this:     $("#popover").popover({ trigger: "hover" });      but this doesn't make sense for smartphones. user can't read hover-triggered popover.    for " div " parts of my site, i use " visible-desktop " or "hidden-desktop". can you offer a good way to trigger popover with hover- for desktops trigger popover with click- for smartphones/tablets. (i use   2.3.1)    related:  make   popover appear/disappear on hover instead of click
