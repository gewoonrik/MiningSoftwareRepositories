Why cant I see   classes--html file on local drive  A very simple way to get started with Bootstrap is to reference the Bootstrap CSS and JS on from BootstrapCDN right in your HTML. No need to compile...(Following instructions in ref 2) Before diving into Bower, I want to explore dependencies manually.So I open this file in Chrome. Angular works. The css classes do not. In the html, are the references pointing correctly? If so why are my classes not displaying? Its been days and there must be some big elephant in the room that I am not seeing.
