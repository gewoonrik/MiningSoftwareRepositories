rails   2.3.1 navbar color  i'm already trying for hours but i can't figure out how to change the navbar color and the navbar text color in my rails   project. i've read about .navbar-inner in some css files but nothing i write in any file seems to have any effect. maybe it's because of a newer version of  ? could someone please give me a step by step solution?     i've tried to change the " _and_override.css / .css.less" files but nothing happened. do i have to compile the .css.less file or something like that? thank you very much!    here is my gemfile if its relevant:     source '  '2.0.0'  gem 'rails', '3.2.13'  # bundle edge rails instead: # gem 'rails', :git =  'git://github.com/rails/rails.git'   gem 'bcrypt-ruby', '3.0.1' #gem ' -sass', '2.1' gem 'faker', '1.0.1' gem 'will_paginate', '3.0.3' gem ' -will_paginate', '0.0.6' gem "therubyracer" gem "less-rails" #sprockets (what rails 3.1 uses for its asset pipeline) supports less gem " - -rails"  gem 'json'  group :development do     gem 'sqlite3' end  group :production do     gem 'pg'     gem 'coffee-rails', '~  3.2.1'     gem 'uglifier' end  # gems used only for assets and not required # in production environments by default. group :assets do   gem 'sass-rails',   '~  3.2.3'   gem 'coffee-rails', '~  3.2.1'   gem 'uglifier'   gem 'therubyracer'    # see   for more supported runtimes   # gem 'therubyracer', :platforms =  :ruby  end  gem 'jquery-rails'
