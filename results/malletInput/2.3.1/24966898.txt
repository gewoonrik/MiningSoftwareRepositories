angular directive that adds select2 corrupts model?  i've created a table with ng-repeat and a directive to add a select2 ddl when you click on one of the cells. everything works beautifully, the selected value is updated in the model (everything with the select2 works as expected), but somehow the model seems to be corrupted by having this directive included in the code (whether i have selected an item from the ddl or not).    after the table is loaded with the data, if i try to remove an item from the model (with splice):
