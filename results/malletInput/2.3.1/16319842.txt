Bootstrap Carousel not sliding at start  I implemented a   carousel, which works quite nice, as long as I click at start on the next arrow. Then it starts sliding automatically. If I dont click anything, it just does not start. What can be the problem? I read a lot of posts, tried different things:      adjusted jquery version: tried from 1.7.1 to 1.9.1, no changes   looked at my included .js files, checked if they got the right order   compared html code to the   example      In the end, I did not find out the error.    My html code looks like that in the end after the page is loaded:         Versions: jQuery 1.9.1 angular js 1.0.6   2.3.1    Any help is really appreciated.    EDIT: The problem was, that the jquery lib was included after angular js. As I switched it, it worked...
