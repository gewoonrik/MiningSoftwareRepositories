  carousel not sliding at start  i implemented a   carousel, which works quite nice, as long as i click at start on the next arrow. then it starts sliding automatically. if i dont click anything, it just does not start. what can be the problem? i read a lot of posts, tried different things:      adjusted jquery version: tried from 1.7.1 to 1.9.1, no changes   looked at my included .js files, checked if they got the right order   compared html code to the   example      in the end, i did not find out the error.    my html code looks like that in the end after the page is loaded:         versions: jquery 1.9.1 angular js 1.0.6   2.3.1    any help is really appreciated.    edit: the problem was, that the jquery lib was included after angular js. as i switched it, it worked...
