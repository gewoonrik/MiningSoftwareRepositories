Bootstrap 2.3.1 - Modal with remote doesn't load first time, but does after the first time  I have a   modal that loads remote content. This does not work the first time the link is click. The modal comes up, but remote content is not loaded. I checked the logs, and the remote call is not even made.    If I click the link a second or more times, it works perfectly. I originally was using the standard bootsrap link method, but have since changed to pure javascript hoping to get more control. The link click function is now:         It gets called every time, and the model comes up every time, but it only makes the remote call after the first time. The remote call is to the same domain/machine.  (All of this is inside a grails app.)    Any ideas? I'm not sure what else to try.
