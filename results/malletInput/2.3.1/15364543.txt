  2.3.1 - modal with remote doesn't load first time, but does after the first time  i have a   modal that loads remote content. this does not work the first time the link is click. the modal comes up, but remote content is not loaded. i checked the logs, and the remote call is not even made.    if i click the link a second or more times, it works perfectly. i originally was using the standard bootsrap link method, but have since changed to pure javascript hoping to get more control. the link click function is now:     $(function() {                  $(".modal-link").click(function(event) {                      $('.modal-body').text('loading content...');                      var modal = new $.fn.modal.constructor();                      $('#mymodal').modal({keyboard: true})                                   .remote($(this).attr("href"))                                   .show();                   })              })      it gets called every time, and the model comes up every time, but it only makes the remote call after the first time. the remote call is to the same domain/machine.  (all of this is inside a grails app.)    any ideas? i'm not sure what else to try.
