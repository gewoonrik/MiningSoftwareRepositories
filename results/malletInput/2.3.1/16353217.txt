how to change grey (buttons-links) on navbar (menu)  ?  i m playing around with   for the couple past days and it seems that i can't figure out how to change the main color of the links(buttons of the navbar). i am currently using version 2.3.1 . i've managed to change the color when on hover(onmouse) to (orange) but i can't change the main color which is something like a light grey. i want it to be black.    ![mouseout]        ![mouseon]        what i want is where can i find that grey color and if possible the font type and change it. thanks everyone
