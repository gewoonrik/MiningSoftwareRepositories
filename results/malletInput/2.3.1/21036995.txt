  3.x like grid column ordering in   2.3  now i know   3.x is out and i should be moving to 3.x. but, this is a change request that has come up in an existing site that uses   2.3.1.    here's the thing, that i want to achieve:    i am using a 3 column layout in the 12-column   grid as:       div class='row'     div class='span3'  /div     div class='span6'  /div     div class='span3'  /div   /div       the desired responsive behavior is:     large screens:      [ x ][ y y ][ z ]       tablet portrait:      [ y    y ] [ x ][ z ]       smaller screens:      [yy] [x] [z]      now, i know this can be achieved using  grid column ordering of   3.x . but, i need to achieve this using   2.3.      fiddle for those willing to give this a try!
