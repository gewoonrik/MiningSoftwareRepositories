Use Ajax to load/unload modal windows with Twitter Bootstrap  I'm using Bootstrap (Version 2.3.1) and I'm using Ajax to load in a modal window. Is there a way to remove the modal window from the DOM when I close the modal window?         However, when I close the modal, the html is still in the DOM and if I load the modal again, it outputs the HTML again. Is there a way to remove the modal window from the DOM when I close the modal window?
