Dynamic Images in Bootstrap Carousel initially show as a tiny thumbnail only in Internet Explorer  I am using Bootstrap version 2.3.1 in an ASP.NET MVC project.  I am using the Carousel feature to display some images that are pulled in from a database, however, when the page is navigated to the image initially comes in as a tiny thumbnail only in Internet Explorer and only if the image has not been cached.  Any ideas?
