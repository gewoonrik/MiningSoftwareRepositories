dynamic images in   carousel initially show as a tiny thumbnail only in internet explorer  i am using   version 2.3.1 in an asp.net mvc project.  i am using the carousel feature to display some images that are pulled in from a database, however, when the page is navigated to the image initially comes in as a tiny thumbnail only in internet explorer and only if the image has not been cached.  any ideas?
