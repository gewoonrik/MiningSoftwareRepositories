Application layout not shown in Rails 3  I have looked over my basic starting code to be sure I didn't make a spelling goof. You may see something I did. I cannot get my application.html.erb to appear. My basic app has only one model. I haven't installed a controller and view working the model first via TDD. I installed  'twitter- -rails' and followed the install procedure. I did not test the view before installing  . My ruby is 1.9.3 and my rails app is 3.2.11 Here is my routes.rb         My views/layouts/application.html.erb has the twitter- -rails layout with a  %= yield %>    I'm aware that my controller is not named the Rails way. When I changed it to weathers in all the appropriate places, the result is the same. I get the word test with NONE of the application html code. The source of the result is just "test" with no html headers or output. If I put layout: 'application' in the index action I get it to appear but not the contents of the index.html.erb. I have looked in SO but they do not seem to apply, or work. Being new at this is an impediment. I'm sure I overlooked something stupid. Thanks for looking, sam
