application layout not shown in rails 3  i have looked over my basic starting code to be sure i didn't make a spelling goof. you may see something i did. i cannot get my application.html.erb to appear. my basic app has only one model. i haven't installed a controller and view working the model first via tdd. i installed  ' - -rails' and followed the install procedure. i did not test the view before installing  . my ruby is 1.9.3 and my rails app is 3.2.11 here is my routes.rb      root :to =  'weather#index'  resources :weather      here is my applicable gemfile      group :assets do    gem 'sass-rails', '~  3.2'    #gem ' -sass', '~  2.3.1.0' bailed when it seemed to conflict    gem 'coffee-rails', '~  3.2.1'    gem 'uglifier', ' = 1.0.3'  end      here is my controller:      class weathercontroller   actioncontroller::base    def index    end  end      here is my views/weather/index.html.erb:      test      my views/layouts/application.html.erb has the  - -rails layout with a  %= yield %>    i'm aware that my controller is not named the rails way. when i changed it to weathers in all the appropriate places, the result is the same. i get the word test with none of the application html code. the source of the result is just "test" with no html headers or output. if i put layout: 'application' in the index action i get it to appear but not the contents of the index.html.erb. i have looked in so but they do not seem to apply, or work. being new at this is an impediment. i'm sure i overlooked something stupid. thanks for looking, sam
