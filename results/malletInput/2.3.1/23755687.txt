Color issue for Bootstrap progress bar  I am using Bootstrap CSS (Bootstrap v2.3.1). I am trying to display multiple progress bar on the page. For that i have written code as given below-         I have given 50 and 100 width value to these progress bar after that they show same color for both.         Color of first progress bar get reflected in second progress bar. Is there any mistake from my side?
