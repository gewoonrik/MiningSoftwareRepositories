why does this work? -   boostrap 2.3.1  i recently  posted a question  where i asked how i may be able to vertically align a responsive image. i found the answer on my own, but it raised an even bigger question because i have no idea how or why it works.    take a look at this jsfiddle:         which uses the following code to vertically align an image in the navbar:          however, without  s newest version (2.3.1) this does not work!   take a look at this jsfiddle:         this second jsfiddle does not include boostrap 2.3.1 but does contain boostrap 2.3.0 (contained inside an external css file i called layout.css) and yet it does not work.     question:  does anyone know what part of     2.3.1 is causing the image inside the navbar to be responsive?
