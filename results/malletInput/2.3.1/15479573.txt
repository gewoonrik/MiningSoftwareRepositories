Simple jquery event binding not working anymore  I used to bind a click event on a table row like this :         But it's not working anymore. I re-tried jQuery from 1.8.0 to 1.9.1 (latest) and it does nothing. I checked if it was twitter-  (retrieved from  cdn) : from 2.1.0 to 2.3.1 nothing changed.    My test config is FireFox/Chrome latests. The website is running on symfony2 with jQuery plus twitter   and Datatables plugins/css.    So, questions:      How to debug that ?   Any solution ?
