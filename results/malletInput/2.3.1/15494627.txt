Can't fix a conflict between CloudZoom v1.0.3 and the default Bootstrap v2.3.1 Carousel  Bootstrap carousel and cloud zoom work but only with the first image. Here is a demo displaying the problemâ€¦        Although the link above or cloud zoom is for an updated version, I figured I could maybe get an idea.    The carousel works by either clicking on either one of the previous, next and/or pause symbols in addition to clicking on the thumbnails below.    Maybe trying to add the function to the click or perhaps binding the cloud zoom upon completion of the carousel.
