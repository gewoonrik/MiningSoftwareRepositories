can't fix a conflict between cloudzoom v1.0.3 and the default   v2.3.1 carousel    carousel and cloud zoom work but only with the first image. here is a demo displaying the problemâ€¦        although the link above or cloud zoom is for an updated version, i figured i could maybe get an idea.    the carousel works by either clicking on either one of the previous, next and/or pause symbols in addition to clicking on the thumbnails below.    maybe trying to add the function to the click or perhaps binding the cloud zoom upon completion of the carousel.
