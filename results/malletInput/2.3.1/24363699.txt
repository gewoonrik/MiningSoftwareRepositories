modalpopup disappears if i hover-over popover on my modalpopup  got struck in strange problem here. i am using   v2.3.1. i have a  modal dialog box  and in that  modal dialog box  i have couple of  popover  where user can hover the mouse and show some info but the problem i am facing is as soon as user takes his mouse out of  popover , my modal dialog box disappears.    i have debugged the code and can confirm  modals hide/hidden  event is fired as soon as i take mouse out of popover. seems to be some  jquery  problem where instead of fading out popover text, its changes modal level data.    has anyone had thing kind of problem?    some of you may suggest updating  , i am afraid that will lead to testing the whole website which is quite stable with this version.
