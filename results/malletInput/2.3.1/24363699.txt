ModalPopup disappears if i Hover-over popover on my modalPopup  Got struck in strange problem here. I am using   v2.3.1. I have a   problem where instead of fading out popover text, its changes modal level data.    Has anyone had thing kind of problem?    some of you may suggest updating Bootstrap, i am afraid that will lead to testing the whole website which is quite stable with this version.
