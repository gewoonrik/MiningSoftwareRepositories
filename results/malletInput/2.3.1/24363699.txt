modalpopup disappears if i hover-over popover on my modalpopup  got struck in strange problem here. i am using   v2.3.1. i have a   problem where instead of fading out popover text, its changes modal level data.    has anyone had thing kind of problem?    some of you may suggest updating  , i am afraid that will lead to testing the whole website which is quite stable with this version.
