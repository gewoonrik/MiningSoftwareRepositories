getting   to work in rails 2  i have worked with rails 4 earlier and getting   and sass to work with a rails 4 application was very easy by doing:      adding gem  ' -sass'  and gem  'sass-rails', '~  4.0.0'  to the  gemfile  and running  bundle install    add  //= require    line to  application.js    adding  config.assets.precompile += %w(*.png *.jpg *.jpeg *.gif)  line to  application.rb    adding  @import " ";  line to the top of the  *.css.scss  file      but the same when done with a rails 2 application doesnt seem to get the   and scss to work. can anybody explain the steps involved in gettin   and scss to work with a rails 2 application?    p.s : my application's exact  rails version is 2.3.18  and am using  ruby 1.8.7
