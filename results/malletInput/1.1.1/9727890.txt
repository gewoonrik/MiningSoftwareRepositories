formtastic check_boxes using collection not saving checked items in edit form  i know this was supposed to be fixed in formtastic 2.0 but for some reason, this isn't working for me.                  %= f.input :gender, :as =  :check_boxes, :collection =  ["male", "female", "unisex"] %             whenever i go back and check it, the items is always unchecked again.  it never appears as selected.  i know justin french commented about it  here , but i am not sure what it means or how that can help me fix the problem.      i am saving gender as a string in the user model if it makes a difference.     i am also using it with formtastic-  1.1.1    thank you!
