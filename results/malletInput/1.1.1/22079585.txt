Rails Application Not Loading All javascript files production  I am working on a personal website Hosted in AWS. Using Ruby 1.9.3 Rails 4.1.0beta1. When I run the code locally, it works like a charm. However when I push to AWS, its missing either some JS files or some CSS files. I think it is missing JS files because if I remove the following from application.js         I can't quite figure out which files are missing. Please let me know if you need more information. I have been looking around all over and haven't been able to resolve this issue.    I have tried this:  Rails 4: assets not loading in production .
