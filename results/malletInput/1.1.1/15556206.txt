    rel="popover" with data-content not displaying the popover  i am trying to get whatever is in the data-content section of the anchor tag to show as a popover menu. i had it working before when i tested it but now i cannot get the data to display and the only thing i did was add more items to the list that comes in as a model. anyone know why my popover is not working?
