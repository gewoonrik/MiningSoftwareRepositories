Twitter   rel="popover" with data-content not displaying the popover  I am trying to get whatever is in the data-content section of the anchor tag to show as a popover menu. I had it working before when I tested it but now I cannot get the data to display and the only thing I did was add more items to the list that comes in as a model. Anyone know why my popover is not working?
