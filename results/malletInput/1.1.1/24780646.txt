how do i make a   sass variable visible to another imported sass file?  i am using   -sass  in a rails application. so far, everything has worked fine, but i have just tried to import another third-party sass file that uses   variables and it cannot see them.    in my  application.css.scss      *= require  _local      in   _local.css.scss      @import " "; @import " -social";      when i do a page access, i get a rails error     undefined variable: "$line-height-computed". (in .../app/assets/stylesheets/ -social.scss:11)      the variable needed by   -social.scss  is defined in the previously imported     file (in fact it's defined in a partial   /variables  that it includes).     as far as i understand, this should work because   _local  is  required , which means that everything in it is compiled together in one scope, so everything  imported  into   _local  is treated as being one large file. perhaps i have this wrong?    if i throw an  @import " ";  into   -social.scs  then it works fine. but i should not need to do this, so i either doing something wrong or i there is some misconfiguration with my setup.     what do i need to do to fix this?     gems:       -sass-3.1.1.1   sass-rails-4.0.3      system:      rails 4.0.1   ruby 2.0.0p247 (2013-06-27 revision 41674) [x86_64-linux]      (   social  is a set of social sign-in buttons made in pure css based on   and font awesome.)
