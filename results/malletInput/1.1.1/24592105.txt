Ruby on Rails importing   not found   Second Edit  Thanks for all the helpful guidance, I was able to fix the error by rolling back my version of ruby. I had to make several other tweaks, but that was the main one, especially considering that I was following a tutorial.       Edit  I am still unsuccessful after making the changes cjn suggested. I am getting this error:         I have looked at a lot of other posts on how to resolve similar issues, but to no avail.    Thanks in advance for any help!
