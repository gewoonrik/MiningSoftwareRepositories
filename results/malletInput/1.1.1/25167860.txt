  3 modal behaving badly  i'm trying to slowly integrate   3 into an existing site (running on .net 4.5 mvc, fwiw). i developing a page with a modal; it will container a contact form, and eventually i hope to be able to call it from other pages as well.    the problem right now is that the modal will not close properly. when clicking on the close button, the semitransparent background layer disappears and the modal slides up and off the page--but the modal then snaps right back into centered position in the viewport.  }:-(    code for your consideration... in the  head  of the page we are calling...      are about), and i certainly may have missed a key piece. i am trying to do all this using the   css; is there some js i need as well?    thanks in advance!
