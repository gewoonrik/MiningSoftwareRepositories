place checkbox inline with label    documentation and so answers don't seem to be answering this one for me. i want to put a checkbox next to its label. it's simple. i must be doing something wrong, but cannot figure it out.    i'm using:     #gemfile.lock, in my rails application.   -sass (3.1.1.1) rails (4.0.3)      in my rails view:     # devise/registrations/new.html.erb    %= f.label :accept_terms, class: "checkbox" do %       %= f.check_box :accept_terms %  i agree to the terms and conditions listed here    % end %       which generates the following html:        label class="checkbox" for="user_accept_terms"       input name="user[accept_terms]" type="hidden" value="0"  input id="user_accept_terms" name="user[accept_terms]" type="checkbox" value="1"  i agree to the terms and conditions listed here    /label       alternately, in the view:     # devise/registrations/new.html.erb    %= f.label :accept_terms, "i agree to the terms and conditions listed here", class: "checkbox" %     %= f.check_box :accept_terms %       which yields the html:        label class="checkbox" for="user_accept_terms" i agree to the terms and conditions listed here /label     input name="user[accept_terms]" type="hidden" value="0"  input id="user_accept_terms" name="user[accept_terms]" type="checkbox" value="1"       both attempts result in the checkbox and label appearing on separate lines.    i have even tried manually overriding the block display attributes (successfully, according to chome's inspect):     #user_accept_terms { display: inline;} label.checkbox { display: inline; }      how can i get these elements to behave?    thank you in advance.
