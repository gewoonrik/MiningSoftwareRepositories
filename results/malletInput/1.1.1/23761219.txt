  not working after minor change to custom.css.scss  similarly to this issue:  rails: any change to custom.css.scss make the app crash     i have made a change to my custom.css.scss file and all the   references to colors stopped working. i have manually entered the hex values for these colors now and the app loads, but the classes for my navbar are now not working.    it seems that i have a problem referencing any of the   classes now for some reason. i also do not understand why making a minor change to a stylesheet has sent my   styles into a meltdown. i think i must have a setup problem elsewhere.    custom.css.scss:          update:     so i removed and then re-included the  .css and  .min.css files and the main navbar styles came back to life. the only things that are still not working are the references to colors and the styles for my drop-down list in the navbar.
