how to change the position of yii   css register?  i'm using yii   2.2 and yii 1.1.10. i'm using also the yii-  extension from      in my site. i have used similar configuration in other sites, and in that case, the   css is loaded after the css declared in the main layout.    but in this case, the   css is loaded on top of the head tag, before any other css. this causes my nice boostrap buttons to show with rare colors.    the question is, is there any way to change the order of loading this   extension in order to load after my custom classes in header like did it before?    the   is loading well, with no js errors.
