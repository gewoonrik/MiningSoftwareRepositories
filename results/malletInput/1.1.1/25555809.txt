Michael Hartl / Ruby on rails,  , sample app, header css not working/ formatting as expected  I'm trying to follow Michael Hartl's tutorial.  But when i follow the instructions to add   -- some parts work - while others don't.  The blocks are formed, the black bar is there, but the 3 links do not format.  They just show up in blue, one below the other. Could someone please help.    Below is the GEM file         ![Browser showing the header not formatted -red box and then the error boxes are not formatted in Blue box][1]
