jquery mobile js include is overwriting   css - how do i fix?  i'm working on a pyramid (python) web application, and trying to create a responsive-ish design that will gracefully switch between a desktop-sized browser and a mobile browser.  i'm wanting to use     for the desktop ui and jquery mobile for the mobile ui.    my css is like this:         then the desktop ui looks correct.  of course at that point i've lost my jquery mobile ui.    so what seems to be happening is something in the jquery mobile javascript is overriding the style includes, but i don't know what or why. is there a way i can force things to not run the jquery mobile stuff at larger resolutions?  any help or hints?
