Solved: codeigniter javascript not found error  First of all, I am sorry for my bad english, I am spanish and I am sorry if I have made something wrong, this is my first post.    I have a problem with loading a javascript file in codeigniter 2.1.4. I didnÂ´t get loaded it in the header of my page. The css files were well loaded. This example attempts to load jquery and  .    I am following the steps in the documentation of codeigniter and when I create the codeigniter static page "home.php" I want to use   for design.    The tutorial I followed is this:        My folder structure :            htdocs        myproject (curriculos)        application        controller        pages.php          views        templates        header.php          pages        home.php     about.php                    system     assets                 css         .min.css          js         .min.js               jquery- 2.1.0.min.js                         I have been searching in this forum and others and always I find the same example with base_url() or site_url(). These are mine:    Updated code:         The strangest is that when you click on one of them it shows you that the file type is trying to be loaded as a text/html and not as an application/javascript as usual:         Can you help me?    Thank you very much for your reply.
