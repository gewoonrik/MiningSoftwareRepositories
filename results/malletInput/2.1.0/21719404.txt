make simple_form honor my blank/empty label  using simple_form v2.1.0 in a rails 3.2.13 app. i have a simple_form where i want to have a checkbox show up with an inline label, and i want to have an "empty" normal label. this way, the label's container should remain in place and the checkbox will be properly positioned with the other form elements.    if i set      but simple_form thinks it's smarter than me and defaults the label. i wish it only did that if i hadn't specifically supplied a label!
