trying to use   via dropdowns  i'm trying to use   in my website by referring to it's examples, except, for some reason, the dropdown examples it provides don't work; it just displays a blank page. what i did, in order to make sure i wasn't missing anything, was i went to the   website, went to customise, and ensured that i downloaded all possible css/javascript files, ensuring that all possible functions/features were included.    here is a basic example of what i'm trying to do.      html    head     title  /title     !--   css --     link rel="stylesheet" href=".../assets/bs/css/ -theme.min.css"     link rel="stylesheet" href=".../assets/bs/css/ .min.css"    /head    body      div class="dropdown"      button class="btn dropdown-toggle sr-only" type="button" id="dropdownmenu1" data-toggle="dropdown"      dropdown      span class="caret"  /span      /button      ul class="dropdown-menu" role="menu" aria-labelledby="dropdownmenu1"       li role="presentation"  a role="menuitem" tabindex="-1" href="#" action /a  /li       li role="presentation"  a role="menuitem" tabindex="-1" href="#" another action /a  /li       li role="presentation"  a role="menuitem" tabindex="-1" href="#" something else here /a  /li       li role="presentation" class="divider"  /li       li role="presentation"  a role="menuitem" tabindex="-1" href="#" separated link /a  /li      /ul     /div      !-- jquery --     script src=".../assets/js/jquery-2.1.0.min.js"  /script     !--   javascript --     script src=".../assets/bs/js/ .min.js"  /script     /body   /html       the page is connecting to the scripts, i confirmed this through google chrome's inspector. what is more confusing is that i am able to implement some of  's features, but not all, for example i can create buttons with icons it provides, but i can't create dropdowns.    i've researched this issue, but none of the solutions it provides resolves it. does anyone know what i'm missing?    please reply soon, many thanks.       after several checks, i should clarify that yes, i'm using the most up to date  , that i should of mentioned that i'm displaying the page through codeigniter, and at the moment i am still having difficulty getting it to work, but i will be working on it until i do.    thank you for your replies.
