Trying to use Bootstrap via Dropdowns  I'm trying to use Bootstrap in my website by referring to it's examples, except, for some reason, the dropdown examples it provides don't work; it just displays a blank page. What I did, in order to make sure I wasn't missing anything, was I went to the Bootstrap website, went to customise, and ensured that I downloaded all possible CSS/Javascript files, ensuring that all possible functions/features were included.    Here is a basic example of what I'm trying to do.         The page is connecting to the scripts, I confirmed this through Google Chrome's inspector. What is more confusing is that I am able to implement SOME of Bootstrap's features, but not all, for example I can create buttons with icons it provides, but I can't create dropdowns.    I've researched this issue, but none of the solutions it provides resolves it. Does anyone know what I'm missing?    Please reply soon, many thanks.       After several checks, I should clarify that yes, I'm using the most up to date Bootstrap, that I should of mentioned that I'm displaying the page through CodeIgniter, and at the moment I am still having difficulty getting it to work, but I will be working on it until I do.    Thank you for your replies.
