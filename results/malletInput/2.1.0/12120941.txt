Rails delete not working inside twitter   dropdown (2.1.0)  I just upgraded the gem less-rails-  to use twitter   2.1.0, and it seems to have broken this code in my view, inside a   dropdown:         Then run 'bundle update' and restart the server, then the server thinks the DELETE is a GET request.    I tried switching to the gem 'twitter- -rails', and the exact same issue occurs. I assume I must be doing something wrong?
