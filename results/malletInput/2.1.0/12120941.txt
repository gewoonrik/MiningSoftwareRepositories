rails delete not working inside     dropdown (2.1.0)  i just upgraded the gem less-rails-  to use     2.1.0, and it seems to have broken this code in my view, inside a   dropdown:         then run 'bundle update' and restart the server, then the server thinks the delete is a get request.    i tried switching to the gem ' - -rails', and the exact same issue occurs. i assume i must be doing something wrong?
