validate with parsleyjs and display errors with   tooltip  i would like to validate a form with parsley js and display the errors (if any) with  's   tooltip.    i read this  link  about the     integration with parsley and this  stackoverflow question  about eventlisteners.  however, i am still not able to display the error messages.     that's how i implemented it          the tooltip is not triggered with an error in the form field (even with an empty field, no error is raised). how can i get that parsley is triggering the tooltip to work?    side notes:      the code about the 'parsleyoptions' is taken from  here    all js files are accessable   a static tooltip over an input field works   parsley js works when the error is displayed in a div
