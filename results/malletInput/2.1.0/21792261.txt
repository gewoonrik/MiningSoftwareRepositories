Validate with ParsleyJS and display errors with twitter tooltip  I would like to validate a form with parsley js and display the errors (if any) with twitter's   tooltip.    I read this  link  about the twitter   integration with parsley and this  stackoverflow question  about EventListeners.  However, I am still not able to display the error messages.     That's how I implemented it          The tooltip is not triggered with an error in the form field (even with an empty field, no error is raised). How can I get that parsley is triggering the tooltip to work?    Side notes:      The code about the 'parsleyOptions' is taken from  here    all js files are accessable   a static tooltip over an input field works   parsley js works when the error is displayed in a div
