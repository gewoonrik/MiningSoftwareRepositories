how can i set  's @basefontsize if using a cdn?  i was using v2.0.4 of    via a public cdn .    recently (august 20, 2012) version 2.1.0 was released and one of the things among the changes was a  new base font-size and line-height , which are in fact just a little bit bigger.    i understand this is set in  variables.less  and so if i'm using a pre-compiled version i may likely be stuck with the settings - but is there any good way to override things and "reset" the base font-size to something a little bit smaller when using this cdn version, and without having to specify a font-size override for each element that i want to affect?     body{ font-size:.9em; }  unfortunately doesn't help.    2.0.4 rendered h2 font size:         2.1.0 rendered h2 font size:         old and new compressed css in case anyone wants to fiddle:       cdn.com/ - /2.0.4/css/ -combined.min.css      and newer:       cdn.com/ - /2.1.0/css/ -combined.min.css
