Twitter Bootstrap 2.1.0 Submenu Looks Messy on Responsive  I'm using Twitter Bootstrap 2.1.x and already able to use multilevel submenu as I apply here:  Simple Multilevel Menu With Bootstrap 2.1.x .    But the problem arise when its collapse.  The default view is expand all . This doesn't look good as the menu will cover the whole screen on iPhone.    I would like to know: is there any function to collapse all when the collapse menu button triggered? (The sub-menu should be open when user clicks it.)    Please let me know your thought about this. Thanks.
