    2.1.0 submenu looks messy on responsive  i'm using     2.1.x and already able to use multilevel submenu as i apply here:  simple multilevel menu with   2.1.x .    but the problem arise when its collapse.  the default view is expand all . this doesn't look good as the menu will cover the whole screen on iphone.    i would like to know: is there any function to collapse all when the collapse menu button triggered? (the sub-menu should be open when user clicks it.)    please let me know your thought about this. thanks.
