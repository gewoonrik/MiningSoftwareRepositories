jquery & stored sortable rows  ok so i was using jquery 1.8.3 to sort a page list order that's pulled from /pages/order what this would allow you to do was drag and drop the pages in what ever order you liked, then a menu was presented on the template view end from pages order. first it started with list items then i thought it better to use tabletools as this had a great search function. that all worked fine.    now i wanted to update because i setup a   3 template for backend and frontend. i recently just tried updating to  3 and got tabletools working great with   in examples, however i can't for the life of me get sortable rows to work. there is a plugin called row reordering that again, i can't seem to get to work. any help would be seriously appreciated.    using:          jsfiddle
