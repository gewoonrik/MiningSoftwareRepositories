jQuery & Stored Sortable Rows  OK so I was using jquery 1.8.3 to sort a page list order that's pulled from /pages/order what this would allow you to do was drag and drop the pages in what ever order you liked, then a menu was presented on the template view end from pages order. First it started with list items then I thought it better to use tabletools as this had a great search function. That all worked fine.    Now I wanted to update because I setup a   3 template for backend and frontend. I recently just tried updating to  3 and got tabletools working great with   in examples, however I can't for the life of me get sortable rows to work. There is a plugin called Row Reordering that again, I can't seem to get to work. Any help would be seriously appreciated.    Using:          jsfiddle
