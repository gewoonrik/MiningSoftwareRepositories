getting an error with javascript when I try to pass my website on Bootstrap3  First sorry for my english.    Im trying to upgrade my website from bootsrap 2 to   3 and this cause me an error with the following script          When I click on my button and inspect the element with Chrome I have this error "Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [data-dismiss="alert"] ".     So I update my jQuery version from 1.9.1 to 2.1.0. So now I dont have any error but when I click on the button the screen goes dark but the window I was expected to appear is not here.    Anyone who knows how to solve that ?    Thanks
