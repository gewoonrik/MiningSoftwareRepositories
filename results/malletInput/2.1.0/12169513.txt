 -  2.1.0 affix plugin - doesn't work properly  i try to use   affix (2.1.0) in one of my mvc4 project. it seems that .span3 and .span9 doesn't work properly if, after scrolling 50px, the .span9 content move to the left.    i found this:  text moves to side of the page on scroll down  but is not working. adding floats to spans works somehow but is not "responsive". i think it must be a better solution.    does anybody make it work ?    here is my code (copy   paste from   site). where i did wrong ?      body data-spy="scroll" data-target=".bs-docs-sidebar"   div class="container"  ....  div class="row"     div class="span3 bs-docs-sidebar" data-spy="affix" data-offset-top="50"       ul class="nav nav-list bs-docs-sidenav"         li  a href="#download- "  i class="icon-chevron-right"  /i  download /a  /li        ....        li  a href="#what-next"  i class="icon-chevron-right"  /i  what next? /a  /li       /ul     /div     div class="span9"      ....      section id="download- "
