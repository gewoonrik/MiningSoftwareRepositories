rails 4 stylesheets loading (    and less)  i try to do some style with rails 4 and less, and got some problems. i install some gems into  gemfile  to get     layout (version 2.x)     gem "less-rails" gem " - -rails"      all is working fine, i have this lines into  app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.less  (note: i've renamed  .css  into  .css.less  for doing tests, i hope it works)     *= require_self *= require  _and_overrides.css.less      then, i installed  selectize.js  plugin (     )    so i put specific less files into  app/assets/stylesheets  :     selectize. 2.less selectize.less plugins/*some_less_files*      and update  application.css.less  to add     *= require selectize. 2.less      when i run my application, i got this error :     showing app/views/layouts/application.html.erb where line #5 raised: variable @inputborderradius is undefined   (in app/assets/stylesheets/selectize. 2.less)      the  app/assets/stylesheets/selectize. 2.less  contains this line :     @selectize-border-radius: @inputborderradius;      i don't understand why it fails, because  @inputborderradius  is defined with   _and_overrides.css.less , in this file :     /.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.0/gems/ - -rails-2.2.8/vendor/toolkit/ / /variables.less      and this file is imported by   _and_overrides.css.less , which import (gem) file   / /  , which import (gem) file   / /variables.less     ... what's wrong ?
