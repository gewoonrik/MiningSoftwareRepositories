open specific     tab after submitting form  i am having trouble opening back up a specific tab after submitting a form. i am using     2.1.0. basically, when the from is submitted, it will go back to the first tab instead of the tab where the form was submitted. here is my code:      ul class="nav nav-tabs" id="mytab"     li class="active"  a href="#tab1" tab 1 /a  /li     li  a href="#formtab" form tab /a  /li   /ul    div class="tab-content"     div class="tab-pane active fade in" id="tab1"      content goes in here    /div      div class="tab-pane fade in" id="formtab"         form action=" " class="center active" method="post"           form stuff goes in here      /form     /div    div       i figured that adding the #id at the end of the link would make the browser open up that specific tab but it goes back to the tab1 tab. any help would be appreciated. thanks
