open specific     tab after submitting form  i am having trouble opening back up a specific tab after submitting a form. i am using     2.1.0. basically, when the from is submitted, it will go back to the first tab instead of the tab where the form was submitted. here is my code:         i figured that adding the #id at the end of the link would make the browser open up that specific tab but it goes back to the tab1 tab. any help would be appreciated. thanks
