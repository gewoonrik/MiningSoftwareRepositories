Open Specific Twitter Bootstrap Tab After Submitting Form  I am having trouble opening back up a specific tab after submitting a form. I am using Twitter Bootstrap 2.1.0. Basically, when the from is submitted, it will go back to the first tab instead of the tab where the form was submitted. Here is my code:         I figured that adding the #id at the end of the link would make the browser open up that specific tab but it goes back to the tab1 tab. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks
