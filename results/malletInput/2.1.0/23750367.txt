dropzone.js upload progress bar not showing  i'm using dropzone.js for file uploads, and it's working perfectly except that the progress bar is not appearing. there are no errors. i'm using   for the front end of the site.    after uploading a file, if i inspect the element in chrome, i see that both it and its parent have a height of 0px:          the strange thing is, if i manually set the height to 10px, it remains 0px. even if i set the width and height  inline , it remains 0px width and height in the element inspector. (     any ideas will be appreciated.
