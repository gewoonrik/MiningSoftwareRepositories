dropzone.js upload progress bar not showing  i'm using dropzone.js for file uploads, and it's working perfectly except that the progress bar is not appearing. there are no errors. i'm using   for the front end of the site.    after uploading a file, if i inspect the element in chrome, i see that both it and its parent have a height of 0px:          the strange thing is, if i manually set the height to 10px, it remains 0px. even if i set the width and height  inline , it remains 0px width and height in the element inspector. ( dz-progress , the parent div, will change if i set it, though.)     my best guess is that something in   or jquery is conflicting with it, but i'm not good enough with css to ferret it out (if it's even a css issue). here is my relevant code. i instantiate dropzone with jquery, on the body tag, so that you can drop a file anywhere in the browser window.      div id="upload"  drag and drop anywhere on the page to upload, or click here to select files.  /div   div id="uploads"  /div    script src=" \js\jquery-2.1.0.min.js"  /script   script src=" \js\ .min.js"  /script   script src=" \js\dropzone.js"  /script   script type="text/javascript"      $("body").dropzone({ url: "upload.php", maxfilesize: 10, previewscontainer: "#uploads", clickable: "#upload", paramname: "userfile", success: function(file, response){ alert("success: "+response); }, error: function(file, response){ alert("error: " +response); }, method: "post" });  /script       any ideas will be appreciated.
