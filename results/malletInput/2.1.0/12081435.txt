Why are nested divs (Bootstrap example) so common?  Bootstrap is one of many sites where I have noticed this practice, that to me seems bad but it is widespread enough, and done by people more experienced than me that I think I must be missing something. Take for instance the 2.1.0 version of  Bootstrap , if you view source, lines 44-46 (the top of page menu) are these:         I understand the associated CSS properties of each class, and the shortcomings of using a framework that is made to be useful to as many people in as many situations as possible but having largely finished a design I am now trying to clean my markup. Is there a reason to use 3 divs when 2 would (from what I can tell) suffice?     While '.container' has a set width, clear properties, and margin settings for centering, I don't understand why '.navbar-inner' is in a separate div from it's parent. It seems like it would make more sense to add it as a class to it's parent div and reduce one layer of nesting.    Is there a reason why I should leave this structure in place (or for that matter something I  should incorporate into future coding practices)?
