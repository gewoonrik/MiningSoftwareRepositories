why are nested divs (  example) so common?    is one of many sites where i have noticed this practice, that to me seems bad but it is widespread enough, and done by people more experienced than me that i think i must be missing something. take for instance the 2.1.0 version of    , if you view source, lines 44-46 (the top of page menu) are these:      div class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top"     div class="navbar-inner"       div class="container"       i understand the associated css properties of each class, and the shortcomings of using a framework that is made to be useful to as many people in as many situations as possible but having largely finished a design i am now trying to clean my markup. is there a reason to use 3 divs when 2 would (from what i can tell) suffice?     while '.container' has a set width, clear properties, and margin settings for centering, i don't understand why '.navbar-inner' is in a separate div from it's parent. it seems like it would make more sense to add it as a class to it's parent div and reduce one layer of nesting.    is there a reason why i should leave this structure in place (or for that matter something i  should incorporate into future coding practices)?
