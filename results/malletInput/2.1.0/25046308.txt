affix element in    today i learned about affix and the use of it with  . i read all about it on the   website and stack-overflow, and eventually checked  how to use the new affix plugin in  &#39;s   2.1.0?  (see the jsfiddle link) as a good example.    but, i think i'm doing something fundamentally wrong. i added the right javascript to my index.php. i added the css to my stylesheet and just copy-pasted the nav-bar example from jsfiddle into my index.php. nothing works.     html:          can someone tell me what i did wrong?
