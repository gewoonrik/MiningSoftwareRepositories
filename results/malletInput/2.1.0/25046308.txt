Affix element in Bootstrap  Today I learned about affix and the use of it with Bootstrap. I read all about it on the Bootstrap website and stack-overflow, and eventually checked  How to use the new affix plugin in twitter&#39;s   2.1.0?  (see the jsfiddle link) as a good example.    But, I think I'm doing something fundamentally wrong. I added the right javascript to my index.php. I added the CSS to my stylesheet and just copy-pasted the nav-bar example from jsfiddle into my index.php. Nothing works.     HTML:          Can someone tell me what I did wrong?
