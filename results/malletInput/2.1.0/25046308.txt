affix element in    today i learned about affix and the use of it with  . i read all about it on the   website and stack-overflow, and eventually checked  how to use the new affix plugin in  &#39;s   2.1.0?  (see the jsfiddle link) as a good example.    but, i think i'm doing something fundamentally wrong. i added the right javascript to my index.php. i added the css to my stylesheet and just copy-pasted the nav-bar example from jsfiddle into my index.php. nothing works.     html:       div class="container"       div class="row"           !-- micro hero unit--           div class="span12"               div class="well"                    h1  some page title  /h1                    p this is a website. /p                   p   a class="btn btn-primary" href="#" tell me more /a                    /p               /div           /div       /div   /div        javascript:      $(function () {     $('#nav-wrapper').height($("#nav").height());     $('#nav').affix({         offset: {             top: $('#nav').offset().top         }     }); });      can someone tell me what i did wrong?
