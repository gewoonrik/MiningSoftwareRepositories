Bootstrap dropdown menu not working, button only displays  I've seen a couple topics for this, but I am still unable to get it working.  The button for the dropdown appears correctly but when I click it to show the list of dropdowns, it directs me to "This page can't be displayed".    This is my code:         but I wanted to use the static paths instead of the sources located online.  Also I checked that the paths were correct as I able to do another   tutorial with the same paths.  Thanks in advance!
