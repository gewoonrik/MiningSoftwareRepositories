how to use the new affix plugin in  's   2.1.0?  the   documentation on that topic is a little confusing to me. i want to achieve similar behaviour like in the docs with the affix navbar: the navbar is below a paragraph / page heading, and upon scrolling down it should first scroll along until reaching the top of the page, and then stick there fixed for further scrolldowns.    as jsfiddle does not work with the navbar concept, i've set up a separate page for usage as a minimal example:        i use this as my navbar:         any help appreciated.
