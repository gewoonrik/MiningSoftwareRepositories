Is the Twitter   helper in the Play framework deprecated?  I often use the Twitter   form template helper in my web application as this is very easy.    Yesterday I want to create a form with horizontal fields and found on GitHub  a Pull-Request  with a comment (one year old) from guillaumebort that the helper will be deprecated in the next version.But I found nothing about it in the  Play Template helper Documentation .      Is the helper already deprecated or will it get updated?   Is there already any more sophisticated Bootstrap Template helper as plugin? (I think,  lot  people are using Play+Bootstrap.)    ...or should I write my own helper with support for horizontal fields?
