is the     helper in the play framework deprecated?  i often use the     form template helper in my web application as this is very easy.    yesterday i want to create a form with horizontal fields and found on github  a pull-request  with a comment (one year old) from guillaumebort that the helper will be deprecated in the next version.but i found nothing about it in the  play template helper documentation .      is the helper already deprecated or will it get updated?   is there already any more sophisticated   template helper as plugin? (i think,  lot  people are using play+ .)    ...or should i write my own helper with support for horizontal fields?
