 3 javascript hide/show error message  i have a problem with   3. i would like to show a div when there is an error detected in a form with javascript. the control seems to be ok but the div doesn't show. thank's in advance    html code :      div class="alert1 alert-danger hidden" you have to ... ! /div       javascript code :      script type="text/javascript"      $(function(){      $("#form1").on("submit", function(){       if($("#dossier_pro_numero_rue").val().length   1){        $("div.control-group").addclass("alert-danger");        $("div.alert1").show("slow").delay(3000).hide("slow");       return false;}      });     });  /script       edit :    but finally, my problem is a conflict between   (3.1) and jquery.    if i put in my head page this line :      script src="jquery-2.1.0.min.js"  /script       it's ok    but if i put also this line :      link href="../ /css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"       it's wrong my error message doesn't show    the same code with   version 2.x is ok.    you can test on ...         it's ok, but if you add library   lastest verion, it doesn't run     do you see why ?    edit :    i have found the solution which is very simple and logical :    you don't put 'hidden' :          div class="alert1 alert-danger" you have to ... ! /div
