  3 text element seems to get wrong css from same file  I'm already not much of a designer, but when   goes wrong it gets uglier!  lol    The symptoms:    For the email input element, a   3.1.1 (or 3.2.1)  text input.form-control is getting the css for input[type="text"] height of 20px rather than the .form-control height of 34px.  (also other issues with carousel, but this problem will probably solve that as well).
