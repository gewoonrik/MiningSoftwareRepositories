rails loading assets from older gem  i'm using rvm with bundler and i recently installed a new version of the  -sass gem. however, even after doing  bundle install , rails was still loading the old version of the   assets. since i'm using rvm, i usually don't use  bundle exec  to run things, but i tried that as well.    it was only after i removed the old gem from my gemset (using  bundle clean --force ) that the new version of the assets started being loaded.    here's the result of listing the gems:     new-host:bot palfvin$ gem list | grep    -sass (2.3.2.1, 2.1.0.0)      here's the result of searching the gemfile.lock file (second occurrence is from the dependencies section):     new-host:bot palfvin$ grep   gemfile.lock      -sass (2.3.2.1)    -sass      can someone explain what was going on?
