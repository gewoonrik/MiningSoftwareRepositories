Rails4: How to serve gem specific javascript files?  I copied a working rails app into a different directory and renamed it using the rename Gem.     Most of the rails functionality works correct, but I am not able to serve assets bundled with gems specifically js files from  -slider-rails    I have compared my application.rb , Gemfile and application.js and they are the same in both apps.     I have tried uninstalling and installing the gem again     Simple comparison among the apps is not resolving issue.     Here are the files I have verified are same in both apps:      Gemfile   application.rb   application.html.haml   application.js       Any suggestions how I should  debug this ?      Thanks!    Just to show you the issue, compare these 2 images in Rubymine    Working App:      Non working App:      Here is how some relevant files look like:     application.js        application.rb
