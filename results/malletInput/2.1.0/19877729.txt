GWT Bootstrap Responsive NavBar on Android device  I have an issue with GWT Bootstrap Responsive NavBar on Android device as described below.    I am developing an application using GWT Bootstrap (version 2.2.1.0   2.3.2.0-SNAPSHOT) Responsive NavBar . When testing on my Android device, menu items in NavBar is collapsed. First, click on the menu, these menu items is shown on the screen. Click the menu again to collapse it. It works normally.    However, the issue when clicking the menu again, there are  NO  menu items shown.    I also try to open    .github.io  from my Android device, it has the same issue. See the screenshot below.     - Screenshot for the first click:           - Screenshot for third click:          This issue is on my Nexus 4 device, I am not sure whether it works (or does not work) on your Android device.    My question is whether it is GWT Bootstrap bug or Twitter Bootstrap bug? How to solve this issue?    Thanks
