twitter   and jquery ui modal in mvc4  I would like to include both twitter   layout and jquery UI scripts. 1st part, including scripts from jquery UI for modal and datepicker worked fine on the generic MVC4 template view. Today I installed the twitter view and rendering the same body within twitter   view doesn't show the datepicker and the modal, plus I am getting these js errors:         Help greatly appreciated, thanks
