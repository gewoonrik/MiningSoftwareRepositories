Bootstrap affix is always "jumping"  I want to use the affix plugin of   on my sidebar. However, as my site is responsive, it's always jumping on some dimensions, and I can't get it working properly. I tried the solutions listed here:  How to use the new affix plugin in twitter&#39;s   2.1.0?  but it's not just working.      Here's a demo     I know how I could do this on a site with fixed width, but as my site  is  responsive and so is   docs, and as it works perfectly  there , how do I achieve the same effect?    As this isn't probably ever going to work
