  affix is always "jumping"  i want to use the affix plugin of   on my sidebar. however, as my site is responsive, it's always jumping on some dimensions, and i can't get it working properly. i tried the solutions listed here:  how to use the new affix plugin in  &#39;s   2.1.0?  but it's not just working.      here's a demo     i know how i could do this on a site with fixed width, but as my site  is  responsive and so is   docs, and as it works perfectly  there , how do i achieve the same effect?    as this isn't probably ever going to work     .affix {     position: fixed;      top: 20px;      right: 10%; }
