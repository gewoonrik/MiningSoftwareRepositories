How to fix positioning error with jQuery Validation Engine and Twitter Bootstrap modals  I am using Twitter Bootstrap 2.1.0 on my site, I am also using the jQuery Validation Engine 2.6.2 plugin, which these work well together.    Until you try to use the validation engine in a modal:         Notice how we get a horizontal scroll bar, and the message gets cut off?    I am wondering what I can do to fix this?
