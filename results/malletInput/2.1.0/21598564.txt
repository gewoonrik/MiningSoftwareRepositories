how to show new opened tab using jquery/ ?  i'm building a backend for a support system using jquery. i now have a real time chat working (using polling), and i now want to be able to open several chats in tabs that can be opened and closed. so i copied and edited a jquery/  example from  this page . next to it, i'll have a list of users, and when someone clicks a user it should open a new tab with a chat with that respective user. the tabs work pretty well, but i now want to pass a user_id to the tab so that i can open a chat in that tab. since i'm not so proficient with javascript i'm kinda unsure how to do this. the code i have so far is pasted below.    does anybody know how i can pass an argument from a link to the tab? all tips are welcome!
