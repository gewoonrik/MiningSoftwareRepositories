How to show new opened tab using jquery/ ?  I'm building a backend for a support system using jquery. I now have a real time chat working (using polling), and I now want to be able to open several chats in tabs that can be opened and closed. So I copied and edited a jquery/  example from  this page . Next to it, I'll have a list of users, and when someone clicks a user it should open a new tab with a chat with that respective user.

I just need to use a class and an id in the button like this:
