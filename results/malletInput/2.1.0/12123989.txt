twitter   dropdown doesn't toggle closed when it should  Oh man, I've been tearing my hair out over this. 4 hours on a dropdown.    I'm using Twitter Bootstrap.    The fixed nav at the top has a dropdown, pretty standard stuff.    Except that the dropdown doesn't get closed as it normally should. It will only toggle open and closed when the toggle itself is pressed, not when an item in the menu is pressed or the user clicks outside the menu (both of these should close the dropdown).    The only thing I'm doing non-standard is my use of an iframe and a theme from bootswatch.    I haven't had an issue like this before so I have a feeling it may be a bug (upgraded   to 2.1.0, and jquery to 1.7.2 today).    all the code here:         live here:
