  glyphicons in play framework  i want to use   s glyphicons  in play framework    so when i use   i class="icon-search" /  ,   is looking for the icons in "assets/img/...". this behaviour conflicts with the  anatomy of a play application  because images are in "assets/images/...".    so i tried to remap this by defining an extra route for get requests to "assets/img":     # map static resources from the /public folder to the /assets url path get     /assets/img/*file           controllers.assets.at(path="/public/images", file) get     /assets/*file               controllers.assets.at(path="/public", file)      but doing so, i get an compilation error "not enough arguments for method at: (path: string, file: string)play.api.mvc.call. unspecified value parameter file. " on every other public asset i'm calling.    what am i doing wrong?
