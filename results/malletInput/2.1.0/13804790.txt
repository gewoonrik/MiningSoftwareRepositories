getting   typehead ajax to work  a lot of the posts on typeahead use a plugin, even though since 2.1.0   has supported ajax calls for typeahead.    i am unable to make it work for what i need - an ajax call of suggested words, at which point clicking on one yields a redirect.    so eg if you type in "lif" it will query "lif" (rest) to another page, return options (life=>  lifealone=>  etc), and clicking on life or lifealone will then take you to that respect url it is associated with.    i know i could use jqueryui autocomplete, but i'd prefer to keep it withint  's native js/css. is this even possible?
