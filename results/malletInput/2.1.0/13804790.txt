Getting Bootstrap Typehead ajax to work  A lot of the posts on typeahead use a plugin, even though since 2.1.0 Bootstrap has supported ajax calls for typeahead.    I am unable to make it work for what I need - an ajax call of suggested words, at which point clicking on one yields a redirect.    So eg if you type in "lif" it will query "lif" (REST) to another page, return options (life=>  lifealone=>  etc), and clicking on life or lifealone will then take you to that respect url it is associated with.    I know I could use jqueryui autocomplete, but I'd prefer to keep it withint Bootstrap's native JS/CSS. Is this even possible?
