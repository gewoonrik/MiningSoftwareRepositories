multiple transitions for     .transition?  i am wanting to animate two properties in   v2.1.0,    the  opacity  and the  margin .    i have tried:     .transition(opacity 0.5s, margin 0.25s); : no output   .transition('opacity 0.5s, margin 0.25s'); : invalid css output   .transition(opacity 0.5s); .transition(margin 0.25s); : margin overrides opacity.    note that i am using  lessphp  so solutions that use the javascript regex will not work.    i know i could copy the mixin and modify it to accept two parameters as well, but that just seems hacky, surely there is a better way?
