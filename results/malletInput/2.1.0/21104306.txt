trouble with nav-justified in   3.0 on responsive devices  i am using the   3.0 framework and modern business theme (   .com/modern-business ). when using the default modern business nav settings, the main menu dropdowns work brilliantly as they should on mobile devices. however, when i change the menu to be "nav-justified" in the html code (using  's "nav-justified" css class), the menu does not work as expected.    when you tap any menu item with dropdowns, it shows a navigation dropdown on the far left side, which runs outside of the parent css frame:         i am also using the sticky nav solution found here:  how to use the new affix plugin in  &#39;s   2.1.0?     here is my html code for the menu:         here, also, is the obligatory jsfiddle to examine (js and css code linked in the jsfiddle panel on the left):        i'm sure i'm somehow dancing around the answer, but this thing has had me stumped for two days now, and i need a fresh brain to look at things. i'm happy to provide whatever extra code is needed to help find the answer.
