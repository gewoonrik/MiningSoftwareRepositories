removing index.php from codeigniter  as of right now... this is the address that shows up when i run the application (and it's functional).         this is what my config file looks like...      i've tried setting it from 'auto' to 'path_info' and haven't had any luck there. there has been some talk about changing things on apache but i have no idea how to do that.    i already checked out the following posts and wasn't able to get this working...       remove index.php in codeigniter 2.1.0     remove index.php from url - codeigniter 2       i'm currently running...      netbeans 7.3.1   codeigniter +     boilerplate   mamp 2.2      definitely let me know what other information i can provide and i'll re-edit the post. i definitely feel like an idiot after wading through these other pieces of documentation and still not being able to get this figured out.
