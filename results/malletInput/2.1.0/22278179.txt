removing index.php from codeigniter  as of right now... this is the address that shows up when i run the application (and it's functional).           if i take away the index.php it also works...           running these two uri's is the same as running this function (which is functional).           but if i try and run it without the index.php it's not functional...           in my code i have 2 .htaccess files...         in the one that is right underneath "views" the code is this...     deny from all rewriteengine on rewritecond %{request_filename} !-f rewritecond %{request_filename} !-d rewriterule .* index.php/$0 [pt,l]       in the one underneath "system" the code is this...     adddefaultcharset utf-8  ifmodule mod_rewrite.c  rewriteengine on rewritecond %{request_filename} !-f rewritecond %{request_filename} !-d rewriterule .* index.php/$0 [pt,l]   # my url is   /arny/ # set your own rewritebase /  #removes access to the system folder by users. #additionally this will allow you to create a system.php controller, #previously this would not have been possible. #'system' can be replaced if you have renamed your system folder. rewritecond %{request_uri} ^system.* rewriterule ^(.*)$ /index.php?/$1 [l]  #when your application folder isn't in the system folder #this snippet prevents user access to the application folder #submitted by: fabdrol #rename 'application' to your applications folder name. rewritecond %{request_uri} ^application.* rewriterule ^(.*)$ /index.php?/$1 [l]  #checks to see if the user is attempting to access a valid file, #such as an image or css document, if this isn't true it sends the #request to index.php rewritecond %{request_filename} !-f rewritecond %{request_filename} !-d rewriterule ^(.*)$ index.php?/$1 [l]  /ifmodule       this is what my config file looks like...      i've tried setting it from 'auto' to 'path_info' and haven't had any luck there. there has been some talk about changing things on apache but i have no idea how to do that.    i already checked out the following posts and wasn't able to get this working...       remove index.php in codeigniter 2.1.0     remove index.php from url - codeigniter 2       i'm currently running...      netbeans 7.3.1   codeigniter +     boilerplate   mamp 2.2      definitely let me know what other information i can provide and i'll re-edit the post. i definitely feel like an idiot after wading through these other pieces of documentation and still not being able to get this figured out.
