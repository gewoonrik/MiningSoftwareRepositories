Removing index.php from codeigniter  As of right now... This is the address that shows up when I run the application (and it's functional).         This is what my config file looks like...      I've tried setting it from 'AUTO' to 'PATH_INFO' and haven't had any luck there. There has been some talk about changing things on Apache but I have no idea how to do that.    I already checked out the following posts and wasn't able to get this working...       Remove index.php in codeigniter 2.1.0     Remove index.php From URL - Codeigniter 2       I'm currently running...      Netbeans 7.3.1   CodeIgniter + Twitter BootStrap Boilerplate   MAMP 2.2      Definitely let me know what other information I can provide and I'll re-edit the post. I definitely feel like an idiot after wading through these other pieces of documentation and still not being able to get this figured out.
