Responsive  -sass setup  I'm trying to use   -sass (2.1.0.0)  for a responsively designed Ruby on Rails 3.2.8 site. This is my first attempt at responsive design with Rails or Bootstrap.    The problem is that some, but not all, of my CSS styles are being matched to the appropriate selectors. Specifically, the custom styles that I apply to, say,   while troubleshooting this issue.    I'm at a loss on how to troubleshoot this further. Any help would be much appreciated.
