responsive  -sass setup  i'm trying to use   -sass (2.1.0.0)  for a responsively designed ruby on rails 3.2.8 site. this is my first attempt at responsive design with rails or  .    the problem is that some, but not all, of my css styles are being matched to the appropriate selectors. specifically, the custom styles that i apply to, say,   while troubleshooting this issue.    i'm at a loss on how to troubleshoot this further. any help would be much appreciated.
