responsive  -sass setup  i'm trying to use   -sass (2.1.0.0)  for a responsively designed ruby on rails 3.2.8 site. this is my first attempt at responsive design with rails or  .    the problem is that some, but not all, of my css styles are being matched to the appropriate selectors. specifically, the custom styles that i apply to, say,  .navbar-fixed-top  in custom.css.scss appear both in my compiled custom.css stylesheet and on the page rendered in the browser. however, the responsive   styles for  .navbar-fixed-top   appear in the compiled custom.css (according to chrome's inspector) but do  not  appear on the page rendered in the browser .    if, inside custom.css.scss, i change  @import " -responsive";  back to the default  @import " "; , the   styles for  .navbar-fixed-top  appear on the rendered page. the issue seems to be related to the responsiveness specifically.    i've had trouble finding related info related to my specific issue. i changed the   default  meta name="viewport"  tag to   meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"   after finding  this question , but my issue isn't iphone specific.    i've also been restarting the  $ rails server  while troubleshooting this issue.    i'm at a loss on how to troubleshoot this further. any help would be much appreciated.
