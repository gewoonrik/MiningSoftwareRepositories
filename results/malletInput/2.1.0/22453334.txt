how to force to use jquery 1.9.x with   3.1 with rails?  i was wondering why my application didn't work anymore, it's because i imported inside my  gemfile  these depencencies:     # use rails-assets. see   'rails-assets- ' gem 'rails-assets-jquery.browser'     if i take a look about these gems, i can see that they both load this via  require "rails-assets-jquery"      rails-assets-jquery-2.1.0/lib/rails-assets-jquery.version.rb :     module railsassetsjquery   version = "2.1.0" end       i don't want to use 2.1, because it doesn't support ie8 anymore, i need 1.9.x, but how can i force to use this version?     more explanations  i'm actually working on the new version of the application, migrating from   2.3 to 3.1, i need to upgrade jquery from 1.7 to 1.9 (  3 requirement). but i need to run both applications at the same time, because some parts of the application still use the old version. i need to make my code works with both.     my first issue is that if i import   in my gemfile, i automatically use 2.1 in both version and the old code is broken with  uncaught typeerror: object [object object] has no method 'autocomplete' .    i'm not sure if what i want to do is possible, maybe i should not use gems to use   3.x...
