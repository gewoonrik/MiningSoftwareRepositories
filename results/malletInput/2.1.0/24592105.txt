ruby on rails importing   not found   second edit  thanks for all the helpful guidance, i was able to fix the error by rolling back my version of ruby. i had to make several other tweaks, but that was the main one, especially considering that i was following a tutorial.       edit  i am still unsuccessful after making the changes cjn suggested. i am getting this error:         i have looked at a lot of other posts on how to resolve similar issues, but to no avail.    thanks in advance for any help!
