Why is my Header Getting Covered by Nav Bar? BootStrap  I am planning around with boostrap and wondering why when I use the built in classes that my header is still getting cut off. I can use css to move it but I would figure I would not need to add my own css when using the   header classes.    This is the generated page, I am using Asp.net MVC 5.1 from VS 2013. So alot of it is in the master page.
