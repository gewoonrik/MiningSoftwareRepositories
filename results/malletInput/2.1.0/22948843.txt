why is my header getting covered by nav bar?    i am planning around with boostrap and wondering why when i use the built in classes that my header is still getting cut off. i can use css to move it but i would figure i would not need to add my own css when using the   header classes.    this is the generated page, i am using asp.net mvc 5.1 from vs 2013. so alot of it is in the master page.
