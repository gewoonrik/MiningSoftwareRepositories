  dropdown menu not working over 3g/cellular network  my   menu works absolutely fine on desktop systems, and even on iphone/ipad when connected via wireless. however, as soon as i test over a 3g/cellular connection (ie. disable wifi), the dropdown menu does not appear.    what's even stranger is that the examples on the   website all work fine over 3g, so i copied and pasted there exact code into my site to test and it doesn't work!    here's the default dropdown code:      div class="btn-group"   button data-toggle="dropdown" class="btn dropdown-toggle" action  span class="caret"  /span  /button   ul class="dropdown-menu"       li  a href="#" action /a  /li       li  a href="#" another action /a  /li       li  a href="#" something else here /a  /li       li class="divider"  /li       li  a href="#" separated link /a  /li    /div       again, this all works fine over wifi, but the drowndown menu does not appear when on 3g, even though the   example works fine...    update: this issue was fixed simply by updating the  .js (must have got changed/corrupted at some point?) but the latest 2.1.0 introduced a bug where dropdown menu items cannot be selected. reported here:    / /issues/4756
