Bootstrap Dropdown Menu not working over 3G/Cellular Network  My Bootstrap Menu works absolutely fine on desktop systems, and even on iPhone/iPad when connected via Wireless. However, as soon as I test over a 3G/Cellular connection (ie. Disable WiFi), the dropdown menu does NOT appear.    What's even stranger is that the examples on the Bootstrap website all work fine over 3G, so I copied and pasted there exact code into my site to test and it doesn't work!    Here's the default dropdown code:         Again, this all works fine over WiFi, but the drowndown menu does not appear when on 3G, even though the   example works fine...    UPDATE: This issue was fixed simply by updating the  .js (must have got changed/corrupted at some point?) BUT the latest 2.1.0 introduced a bug where dropdown menu items cannot be selected.
