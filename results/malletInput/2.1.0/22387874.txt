jquery validate plugin,  , jasny   file input regex - validation working in firefox not in chrome/ie  ok, bear with me as this thing is fairly complicated not only to explain - we are trying to provide "friendlier" client-side validation for file uploads, ensuring that any illegal characters are not present in files they are attempting to upload (yes, we do server-side validation as well, but would like to allow the user to fix any illegal characters in files before attempting to upload).    we are also using   2.1.0, and jasny's file input styling for  . we have a regex for jquery validate working fine for regular inputs, but in this case, the validation is triggering whether there is an illegal character in the filename or not, and the validation messages are not clearing properly, etc.    here is a link to a fiddle to illustrate it better:        here is the js for the additional method:     $.validator.addmethod( "regexdoc", function (value, element) {     return this.optional(element) || !(/:|\^|\[|\]|\?| |#|\\|\*|\'|\"| | |\||%/g.test(value)); }, "document names cannot contain characters /, :, ?, \\, *, |, [, ],  , ', ^, #,  , or  .");      and here's the js for the validate:     $("#frmupload") .validate({     debug: true,     errorplacement: function (error, element) {         element.closest('.control-group')             .find('.help-block')             .html(error.text());     },     highlight: function (element, errorclass, validclass) {         $(element)             .closest('.control-group')             .removeclass('success')             .addclass('error');     },     unhighlight: function (element, errorclass, validclass) {         $(element)             .closest('.control-group')             .removeclass('error')             .addclass('success');     },     success: function (label) {         $(label)             .closest('form')             .find('.valid')             .removeclass("invalid");     },     rules: {         uploadfile1: {             required: true,             minlength: 4,             regexdoc: true         },         renameuploaddoc1: {             required: true,             minlength: 4,             maxlength: 45,             regexdoc: true         }     } });      to reproduce the problem i'm having, please attempt the following (ie9+ or chrome 33+):       first, choose a file by clicking the "select document" button. ideally, choose a file that does not contain illegal characters (to show the validation triggers even though it should not). notice the validation triggers even though your file should not meet the critera to trigger the error message, even though the message shows regardless.     oddly enough, the second field (which gets automatically populated with the filename from the file input) is highlighted in green, meaning the validation does work for that field. if you choose a file that does contain an illegal character, as soon as you tab out of field or move focus, it will trigger the validation, letting you know it is incorrect.        note:  the filename should be showing up after choosing a file to upload, and it does with jasny boostrap 2.1.1, but 2.3.0 was the lowest version we could find on cdn to link to - i don't think that makes a difference here since it (the validation) doesn't work with 2.1.1 or 2.3.0 regardless of the filename issue.    what is odd is it seems to work fine in firefox 27, but chrome 33 and ie9+ seem to exhibit the same issues. any ideas about how to troubleshoot this are greatly appreciated.
