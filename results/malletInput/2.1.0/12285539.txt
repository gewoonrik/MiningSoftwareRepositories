jqgrid +     (2.1.0): navbar changes style  i am trying to figure out how to fix this problem but i don't seem to be able to find a solution.    i am using jqgrid 4.4.1 (jquery ui 1.8.23) and i've just started to use    .  as you can see in this  fiddle  the navigation bar is messy.  the page selector element is much longer than it should be.  this is a  fiddle  with jqgrid without    .    is there anyone out there who can try to help me to fix this?  are there any other issues i should be aware of?      thanks for your help.
