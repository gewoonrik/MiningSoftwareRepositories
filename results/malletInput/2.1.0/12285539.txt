jqGrid + twitter   (2.1.0): navbar changes style  I am trying to figure out how to fix this problem but I don't seem to be able to find a solution.    I am using jqGrid 4.4.1 (jQuery UI 1.8.23) and I've just started to use twitter  .  As you can see in this  fiddle  the navigation bar is messy.  The page selector element is much longer than it should be.  This is a  fiddle  with jqGrid without twitter  .    Is there anyone out there who can try to help me to fix this?  Are there any other issues I should be aware of?      Thanks for your help.
