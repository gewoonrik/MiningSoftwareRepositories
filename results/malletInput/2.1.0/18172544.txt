how does   manage to use fixed positioning for navbar on ios?  i noticed that even on ios,  's  navbar  manages to stay at the top of the window with  fixed  positioning. despite the fact that i thought that this was meant to be impossible without re-implementing ios scrolling?    i was wondering how this worked, and how i can do it for my own views? nothing i've tried seems to work - the div gets misaligned while scrolling, and only jumps into position after scrolling ends.     edit : here's a minimal(ish!) example. see how on ios the  fixedthing  jumps up as you scroll down. perhaps it's something to do with interacting with the  navbar ?      html       head            meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"            style              @import url('  .com/dist/css/ .css');              .fixedthing {                 position: fixed;                 width: 100%;                 height: 100%;                 background: red;                 opacity: 0.5;             }              .navbar {                 width: 100%;             }          /style            script type="text/javascript" src="  - /2.1.0/ .min.js"  /script        /head       body            div class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top"            /div            div class="fixedthing"  /div            p ...insert lots of page content so it scrolls ... /p        /body   /html
