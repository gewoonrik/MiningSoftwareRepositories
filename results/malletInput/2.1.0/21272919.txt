using the angular seed project unable to run unit tests   updated     i am going through the karma modules looking for code that says chrome and trying to switch to firefox unsuccessfully, if anybody knows where i should look too i will be very happy as well.       i hope somebody is familiar with angular seed. i wrote a small angular js web app and i wanted to write some tests for it so i was learning jasmine and karma today. i found out that angular seed has these libraries installed, i spent the day moving my project to angular seed.     i am having trouble running the unit tests, i am getting the error below
