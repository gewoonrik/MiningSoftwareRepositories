using the angular seed project unable to run unit tests   updated     i am going through the karma modules looking for code that says chrome and trying to switch to firefox unsuccessfully, if anybody knows where i should look too i will be very happy as well.       i hope somebody is familiar with angular seed. i wrote a small angular js web app and i wanted to write some tests for it so i was learning jasmine and karma today. i found out that angular seed has these libraries installed, i spent the day moving my project to angular seed.     i am having trouble running the unit tests, i am getting the error below      chrome 32.0.1700 (mac os x 10.8.4) error     uncaught error:   requires jquery      the funny thing is when i started the server, and in chrome dev console the jquery files are actually loaded correctly on my network and i made sure they came before  .min.js     in my index.html file i have these scripts on the bottom       script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"  /script          script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.3/jquery-ui.min.js"  /script   script src="js/vendor/ .min.js"  /script       before the end of the body     the site is up and running, there are no errors on chrome developer console.     the angular seed came with a package.json file ( i am suppose to run npm install to install the modules inside the angular seed directory )    i included jquery and got the jquery modules installed anyway, that was my second try.     "jquery" : "~2.1.0-rc1"      i even went to download the jquery uncompressed file and linked to it in my index.html from my  js/vendor folder. i unlinked it already. the files still exist in my js/vendor folder.     i am getting the error above after running this     scripts/test.sh      it may be a chrome issue, i am not too sure. i will see if i can switch to testing with firefox. any help or ideas of troubleshooting this issue is appreciated.     if it helps here is my controllersspec.js file     'use strict';  /* jasmine specs for controllers go here */  describe('rootpage', function(){   var rootctrl;    beforeeach(module("backpageapp"))   beforeeach(inject(function ($controller) {     rootctrl = $controller("rootctrl");    }))    describe("rootctrl", function() {     it("should have listings", function() {         expect(rootctrl.listings).tobe(true)     })   }) })
