Javascript error when destroying Bootstrap popover  Trying to change on the go the title and content of a   Popover, I am having some trouble.    I am getting this issue when destroying a popover content in a selector.    The error is this      really contains a Popover.    Edited: I solved it thanks to the comments. I wasn't using the latest versions of Bootstrap. Once upgraded to 2.1.0, all seems to work perfect.    Important! In this new version, you need to set trigger to "hover" as it is by default to "click".    Thanks a lot    Pedro
