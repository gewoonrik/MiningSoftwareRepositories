Dynamically add class to Bootstrap's popover  I'm trying to dinamically add a custom class to popovers in Bootstrap 3. Every other question I found was either for Bootstrap 2.1.0 or useless.    As an example I'd like to add a custom class to the popover triggered by the next piece of code         Any idea on how to approach to a solution? Maybe using data-something, but how/what then?    Thanks a ton!
