dynamically add class to  's popover  i'm trying to dinamically add a custom class to popovers in   3. every other question i found was either for   2.1.0 or useless.    as an example i'd like to add a custom class to the popover triggered by the next piece of code      a class="newsletter-icon" href="#" alt="" title="suscrã­bete al newsletter" data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-content="vivamus sagittis lacus vel augue laoreet rutrum faucibus."  /a       any idea on how to approach to a solution? maybe using data-something, but how/what then?    thanks a ton!
