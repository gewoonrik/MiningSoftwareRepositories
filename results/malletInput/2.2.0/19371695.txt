Less::Error at / Unrecognised input - twitter- -rails  After updating rails from 3.2.3 to 3.2.14, and updating twitter- -rails from 2.2.0 - 2.2.6 I'm getting this Less unrecognised input error:         Googling suggested to downgrade to 2.2.0, however the error remains. I am running less-rails (2.4.2), sass-rails (3.2.6), therubyracer (0.12.0). If anyone needs any other gem versions just shout.    Do I have to update a critical gem to fix this issue?
