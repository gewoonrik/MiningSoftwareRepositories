rails     generator trying to use couch_rest model instead of normal active record  i generated a scaffold as usual:     rails g scaffold job description:text user_id:integer finished:boolean rake db:migrate      but after that, the   layout generator is trying to use couchrest_model it seems:     /users/cblair/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p125/gems/couchrest_model-1.1.2/lib/couchrest/model/base.rb:82:in `method_missing': undefined method `columns' for job:class (nomethoderror)     from /users/cblair/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p125/gems/ - -rails-2.2.0/lib/generators/ /themed/themed_generator.rb:87:in `block in retrieve_columns'     from /users/cblair/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p125/gems/ - -rails-2.2.0/lib/generators/ /themed/themed_generator.rb:101:in `rescue_block'     from /users/cblair/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p125/gems/ - -rails-2.2.0/lib/generators/ /themed/themed_generator.rb:86:in `retrieve_columns'     from /users/cblair/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p125/gems/ - -rails-2.2.0/lib/generators/ /themed/themed_generator.rb:58:in `columns'      i use couchrest for stuff, but not active record. (i basically call a few get and post methods in it).     my first question is, how can i set the default orm so maybe the   generator will pick up on it? i've also tried this:     rails g  :themed jobs fluid --orm=active_record      ~but i get the same error, seems to ignore it.
