 : fluid table too wide for window  i'm working on a project using    . we have a table that has lots of columns and is gonna be larger than the browser window almost every time.    this is what happens on the right :         the table border stays in the browser window, while the table contents do not. if i scroll, the borders stay where they are, they do not "follow" the browser window.    you can see the problem  on this jsfiddle . it works on safari, not on chrome or firefox.    the layout is like this :      body     div class='container-fluid'       div class='row-fluid'         div class='span1'          ... menusidebar here...        /div         div class='span11'           table class="table table-striped table-bordered" style="white-space: nowrap"             thead               tr               /tr             /thead             tbody               tr               /tr             /tbody           /table         /div       /div     /div   /body       i hope you can help me. if you need more information, just ask, i'd be glad to supply. thanks a lot for your time.    this is a rails 3.2 app, using the gem  -sass in version 2.2.1.1 (the problem appears in 2.2.2.0 too). the first three numbers reflect the   version.
