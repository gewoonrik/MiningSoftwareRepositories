Bootstrap dropdown in collapse not showing on first attempt  I have a dropdown menu inside a nav-collapse.    When I reduce the window's width (eg: 700px), the navbar correctly collapses, then I click on btn-navbar to un-collapse it, then I click on the dropdown, but it does not drop down, the menu does not show. If then I collapse and un-collapse again, the dropdown starts working.    The same happens when the window's width is small from the beginning.    It's like the height of the collapsed part was fixed at the beginning, and it doesn't let the dropdown do its thing.         Bootstrap v2.2.0    Firefox 16.0.2
