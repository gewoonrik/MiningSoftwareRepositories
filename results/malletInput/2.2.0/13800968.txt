why does     disable gradients for ie right after defining them?      version 2.2.0 specifies the following css rules for  .btn      filter: progid:dximagetransform.microsoft.gradient(startcolorstr='#ffffffff', endcolorstr='#ffe6e6e6', gradienttype=0); filter: progid:dximagetransform.microsoft.gradient(enabled=false);      why does it disable the filter, right after it has been applied? if i look at the   homepage in ie7 and ie9 i can see that the buttons don't have gradients on them. why did they bother defining a gradient at all?
