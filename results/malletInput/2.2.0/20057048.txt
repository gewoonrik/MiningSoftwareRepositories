  navbar not responsive in phonegap (android) when switching landscape/portray  the three-barred button does not appear on the right corner when turning my device (samsung galaxy s3). and the collapsed and down dropped content neither does work as it should, doesn't fit to the screen width. looks like the responsive breakpoint events are not fired for navbar's content as they should:         is there any elegant way to fix this?    cordova version is 2.2.0.   version is 3.0.2.
