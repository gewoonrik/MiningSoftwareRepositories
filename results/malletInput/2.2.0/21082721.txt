exact same one-line sass code works in one rails project, but not another  first of all this is my first time posting a question on stackoverflow. i'm a big fan. anyway:    i was doing the rails tutorial by michael hartl when, after editing the custom.scss.css file, i suddenly got this error:        sass syntax error        undefined variable: "$gray".     (in /home/shady/workspace/ruby/sample_app/app/assets/stylesheets/custom.css.scss:4)      this isn't a problem with $gray; it is the correct way to spell and capitalize the gray sass variable (i checked, and it works in another rails project). i simplified the custom.scss.css file to pinpoint this error, so all it contains is this:     @import " ";   h1 {    color: $gray; }      in my sample app (the rails tutorial app), i still get this error, but when i use this exact same code in another rails project that i created (to practice the things i learned in the rails tutorial on my own, so it pretty much mimics the sample app), with the exact same gemset and gemfile, this works perfectly fine. here is my gemfile:     source '  '2.0.0' #ruby-gemset=secondtry  gem 'rails', '4.0.2' gem 'bcrypt-ruby', '~  3.1.2'  group :development, :test do   gem 'sqlite3', '1.3.8'   gem 'rspec-rails', '2.13.1'   gem 'guard-rspec', '2.5.0'   gem 'spork-rails', '4.0.0'   gem ' -sass', '2.3.2.0' end  group :test do   gem 'selenium-webdriver', '2.35.1'   gem 'capybara', '2.1.0'   gem 'libnotify', '0.8.0'   gem 'factory_girl_rails', '4.2.1'  end  gem 'sass-rails', '4.0.1' gem 'uglifier', '2.1.1' gem 'coffee-rails', ' =4.0.0' gem 'jquery-rails', ' =3.0.4' gem 'turbolinks', '2.2.0' gem 'jbuilder', '1.0.2'  group :doc do   gem 'sdoc', '0.3.20', require: false end  group :production do   gem 'pg', '0.15.1'   gem 'rails_12factor', '0.0.2' end      this was working perfectly fine the last time i edited custom.scss.css, and i haven't done anything substantial since then. i haven't (at least purposefully) edited any file that i think would cause this. i've tried uninstalling and reinstalling  -sass, but it hasn't worked. i believe it's a problem with sass, but as i'm a rails newbie i have no clue on how to fix it. any advice?
