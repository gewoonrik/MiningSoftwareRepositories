  responsive broken  after cloning my git repo, my app was broken. i fixed it ( deleted the  _and_overrides.css.less ) to the point where i can actually see the pages now but the drop down lists and tabs are broken. this makes me think the  -responsive, for some reason, isn't being loaded. below is what i feel are the culprits.     gemfile          eek, help please?
