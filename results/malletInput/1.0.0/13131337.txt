basic asp.net setup for      i am trying to use     with asp.net in visual studio 2010 ultimate. i cant find anything that explains how to set it up and why. everything i try doesn't quite work. most articles are for mvc and im still new to asp.net so i want to start with the basics before i try mvc.    the closest i have got is to get the styles to work, but the javascript doesnt seem to work no matter what example i try. here is the closest i have got. its a mash up of the modal example snippet on the   website and a few blogs i found about using   with mvc.          %@ page language="c#" autoeventwireup="true" codebehind="webform3.aspx.cs" inherits="webapplication6.webform3" %     !doctype html public "-//w3c//dtd xhtml 1.0 transitional//en" " "   html xmlns=" "   head id="head1" runat="server"       title  /title       link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/ .min.css" /       link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/ -responsive.min.css" /     /head   body       script type="text/javascript" src="~/js/ .min.js"  /script       script type="text/javascript" src="~/js/jquery-1.8.2.min.js"  /script       form id="form1" runat="server"            a href="#mymodal" role="button" class="btn" data-toggle="modal" launch demo modal /a            div class="modal" id="mymodal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="mymodallabel" aria-hidden="true"               div class="modal-header"               button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true" ã— /button               h3 id="mymodallabel" modal header /h3               /div               div class="modal-body"               p one fine bodyâ€¦ /p               /div               div class="modal-footer"               button class="btn" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true" close /button               button class="btn btn-primary" save changes /button               /div              @renderbody()          /div       /form   /body   /html       the files are all in the locations at the links. im starting to think i need to install some prerequisites or something. the @renderbody() shows up as text.    i cannot find any examples that work. any help would be greatly appreciated as ive started going round in circles
