basic asp.net setup for      i am trying to use     with asp.net in visual studio 2010 ultimate. i cant find anything that explains how to set it up and why. everything i try doesn't quite work. most articles are for mvc and im still new to asp.net so i want to start with the basics before i try mvc.    the closest i have got is to get the styles to work, but the javascript doesnt seem to work no matter what example i try. here is the closest i have got. its a mash up of the modal example snippet on the   website and a few blogs i found about using   with mvc.         the files are all in the locations at the links. im starting to think i need to install some prerequisites or something. the @renderbody() shows up as text.    i cannot find any examples that work. any help would be greatly appreciated as ive started going round in circles
