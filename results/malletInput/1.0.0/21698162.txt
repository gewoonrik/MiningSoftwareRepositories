Dynamically output Bootstrap modal  Can anyone explain how I can structure my CF  component/output page to utilise the Bootstrap modal  display dynamically?  The code below works but I need the modal window to  display only the output relating to the ‘cat_ID’, at  the moment it displays all or some results, but never  just those relating to that specific iteration of the  'cat_ID'  Many thanks in advance...
