fixed position navbar only clickable once in mobile safari on ios5  i'm using     to style an ipad optimized website and am running up against an interesting bug in mobile safari on ios5.    after tapping on an anchor link in the fixed position navbar, it correctly takes me to that anchor. however, i am then unable to click on any other links in the navbar until after i have scrolled the page.    the problem appears to be in   itself, since the   site has the same issue:  http:// .github.com/ /     any suggestions for how to work around this?       the code below reproduces the issue. note if you click on the "test js" or "test jquery" (two different types of scrolling, straight js, or jquery based) you will not be able to click again until after you manually move the page.    here is the basic demo code(.jsp):
