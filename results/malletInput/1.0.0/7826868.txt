Fixed position navbar only clickable once in Mobile Safari on iOS5  I'm using Twitter Bootstrap to style an iPad optimized website and am running up against an interesting bug in Mobile Safari on iOS5.    After tapping on an anchor link in the fixed position navbar, it correctly takes me to that anchor.

Here is the basic demo code(.jsp):
