dropdown   menu is not getting populated on webpage  I have a header file where I am trying to include a   dropdown which will have the user id and two more options in the dropdown. In the header file I have created a new div for dropdown and and linked it a php file where I have the logic for populating the user id information for dropdown.     header.php         I am able to get the userid on the main login page. The dropdown works fine for me on jsfiddle but not on the concerned page. When I debug with Firebug.  I see the  tag not highlighted but the  tag i.e. userid highlighted. Can this be a problem?     Can someone please let me know what is the problem here? How do i proceed solving this and debugging?
