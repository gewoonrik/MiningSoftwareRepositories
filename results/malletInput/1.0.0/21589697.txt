dropdown   menu is not getting populated on webpage  i have a header file where i am trying to include a   dropdown which will have the user id and two more options in the dropdown. in the header file i have created a new div for dropdown and and linked it a php file where i have the logic for populating the user id information for dropdown.     header.php         i am able to get the userid on the main login page. the dropdown works fine for me on jsfiddle but not on the concerned page. when i debug with firebug.  i see the  tag not highlighted but the  tag i.e. userid highlighted. can this be a problem?     can someone please let me know what is the problem here? how do i proceed solving this and debugging?
