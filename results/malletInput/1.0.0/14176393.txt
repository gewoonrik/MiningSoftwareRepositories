bootswatch-rails theme doesn't work all  i try to use bootswatch-rails, but it doesn't work well, for example, button doesn't appear right, not like on the bootwatch site, that show.  i put  -sass and bootswatch in my gemfile and bundle install     group :assets do   gem 'sass-rails',   '~  3.2.3'   gem 'coffee-rails', '~  3.2.1'   gem 'bootswatch-rails', ' =0.2.0'    gem 'uglifier', ' = 1.0.3' end gem ' -sass', ' = 2.1.0.0'      and in my  _and_overrides.css.scss file looks like this       // first import journal variables @import "bootswatch/cerulean/variables";  // then   itself @import " ";  // responsive styles go here in case you want them @import " -responsive";  // and finally bootswatch style itself @import "bootswatch/cerulean/bootswatch";        i really don't know what i do wrong.
