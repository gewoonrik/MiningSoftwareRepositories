ember.js and   accordion - the "ember way" of creating the view  my question is not how to make a   accordion work, but to try to make sure that i understand the "ember" way of doing things.     i've created a working example of a   accordion here (as of 3/12/2013):             now, this works, but my question is:  is this the appropriate way of doing this under the ember framework, or should this be somewhere else, such as the didinsertelement call?    ---- update ----  final jsfiddle:
