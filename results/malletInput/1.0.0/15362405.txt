ember.js and   accordion - the "ember way" of creating the view  my question is not how to make a   accordion work, but to try to make sure that i understand the "ember" way of doing things.     i've created a working example of a   accordion here (as of 3/12/2013):         debug: ——————————-  debug: ember.version : 1.0.0-rc.1 debug: handlebars.version : 1.0.0-rc.3 debug: jquery.version : 1.9.1  debug: ——————————-      to make the accordion collapse properly, i had to create an observer to watch the controller.content array. if i did not do this, the accordion did not collapse when the elements were inserted, even if i placed the $().collapse into the didinsertelement hook.      app.indexview = em.view.extend     templatename: 'index'     contentobserver: ( -          ember.run.next this, -              @.$('.collapse').collapse()       ).observes('controller.content')      now, this works, but my question is:  is this the appropriate way of doing this under the ember framework, or should this be somewhere else, such as the didinsertelement call?    ---- update ----  final jsfiddle:
