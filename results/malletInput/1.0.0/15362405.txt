ember.js and   accordion - the "ember way" of creating the view  My question is not how to make a   accordion work, but to try to make sure that I understand the "ember" way of doing things.     I've created a working example of a   accordion here (as of 3/12/2013):             Now, this works, but my question is:  Is this the appropriate way of doing this under the ember framework, or should this be somewhere else, such as the didInsertElement call?    ---- Update ----  Final jsFiddle:
