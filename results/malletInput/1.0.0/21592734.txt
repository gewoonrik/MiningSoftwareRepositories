Conflict between jquery and    I have a code where I am including jquery files and   files in the header.php. I am running into issues where if I include the jquery file before  .js file, it messes up the other tabs on my webpage and basically even if i click on the other tabs it does not navigate me.     I think there is a conflict between jquery and  . I am pasting my header.php file below for more reference.     header.php         Can someone please let me know how do i solve this issue? and how should i load all the js and css files to avoid any issues with the webpage.     Thanks
