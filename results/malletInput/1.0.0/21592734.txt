conflict between jquery and    i have a code where i am including jquery files and   files in the header.php. i am running into issues where if i include the jquery file before  .js file, it messes up the other tabs on my webpage and basically even if i click on the other tabs it does not navigate me.     i think there is a conflict between jquery and  . i am pasting my header.php file below for more reference.     header.php         can someone please let me know how do i solve this issue? and how should i load all the js and css files to avoid any issues with the webpage.     thanks
