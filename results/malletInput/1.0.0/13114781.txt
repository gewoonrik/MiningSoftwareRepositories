bower registering local git package  how can i register a local git package in bower?    my current component.json is as follows     {   "name": "myproject",   "version": "1.0.0",   "dependencies": {     "jquery": "1.8.0",     " / ": "2.1.1"   } }      however i also would like to add a package i have created at  c:/mypackage  which is a git repository with versions tagged. when i do  bower install --save c:/mypackage  it properly adds it to project but it doesn't add it to my component.json.    i am trying  bower register mypackage c:/mypackage  but it keeps giving me      bower error incorrect format      what am i doing wrong?
