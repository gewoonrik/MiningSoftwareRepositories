  3 - container stretched on ie8  i am writing html for a page and have used   3 as well. the page appears to be fine in ff, chrome, ie9 but its not working properly in ie8, ie7.     problem : the main content seems to be stretched fully across the page, i.e. behaves like fluid where as in other browsers works fine.     things i have tried : as given in other forums, i tried including respond.js, meta tag as in below code ( "x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge"), html5shiv but nothing seems to work. i read that   3 doesnt support ie7 officially but even ie8 gives this problem. it looks like the container class is not applied to ie8/7.    can anyone please help on this? below is the html for that. also, its on fiddle -         code
