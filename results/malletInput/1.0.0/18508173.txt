Bootstrap 3 - Container stretched on IE8  I am writing HTML for a page and have used   3 as well. The page appears to be fine in FF, Chrome, IE9 but its not working properly in IE8, IE7.     Problem : The main content seems to be stretched fully across the page, i.e. behaves like fluid where as in other browsers works fine.     Things I have tried : As given in other forums, I tried including respond.js, meta tag as in below code ( "X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"), HTML5shiv but nothing seems to work. I read that   3 doesnt support IE7 officially but even IE8 gives this problem. It looks like the container class is not applied to IE8/7.    Can anyone please help on this? Below is the HTML for that. Also, its on fiddle -         Code
