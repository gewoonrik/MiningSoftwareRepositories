ASP NET -Bootstrap does not work well  Im learning some twitter   concepts. But that snippet does not show the result I expect. The problem is inside the brand div. The brand class shows a title, but in my browser does not look like base webpage.    is there something wrong here?     EDIT1       %@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeBehind="WebForm1.aspx.cs" Inherits="TVS.WebForm1" %>
