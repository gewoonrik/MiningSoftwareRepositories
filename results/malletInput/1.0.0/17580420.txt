asp net -  does not work well  im learning some     concepts. but that snippet does not show the result i expect. the problem is inside the brand div. the brand class shows a title, but in my browser does not look like base webpage.    is there something wrong here?     edit1       %@ page language="c#" autoeventwireup="true" codebehind="webform1.aspx.cs" inherits="tvs.webform1" %>
