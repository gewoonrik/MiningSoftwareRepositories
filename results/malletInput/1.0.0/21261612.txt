Why the slideshow don't appear in my custom theme?  I am pretty new in WordPress theme developing and I have the following problem.    I am trying to create a WordPress theme that used  BootStrap  CSS framework based on this BootStrap demo static website (I have the entire source of this site because it is a downlodable tutorial):    /demo/home.html     This is my  custom WP theme :        So I have create a basic WP theme and as first stage I want to insert the  slideshow  of the previous demo page in the  header.php  file of my WP theme, so this is my  header.php  code:         As you can see I have simply take the    block of the static demo website and I have put it at the beginning of my  header.php  file.    Ok, my WordPress theme is configured to use the BootStrap CSS and the  flexslider.css  and also the  style2.css  file that represent what in the demo website is the  stili-custom.css  (my custom CSS settings that is loaded at last to ovverride the definied properties)    As you can see the problem is that at the beginning of my theme the slide show not appear and I have no idea about this issue.    Why? Can you help me to solve this problem?    Tnx    Andrea
