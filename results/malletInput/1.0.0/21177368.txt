Cannot load   to nodejs  I am quite new to nodejs and  , but I long to build a simple personal website so I got some tutorials.    I download the   2.0.2 and unzip it.    I put   and  -responsive to the stylesheets folder of my project and put  .js and jquery.js to the javascripts folder of my project.And I followed the instruction to change the index.jade and layout.jade as followings:         However, it seems the layout is not just as expected, could anyone tell me what is wrong since this is the basic step and I just got stucked and do not know how to move forward. Thanks!
