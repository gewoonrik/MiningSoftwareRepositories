yuidoc parses but no output and no errors  i've spent the last 4 days trying to get yuidoc to parse my javascript framework and it's really starting to drive me nuts.    here is my json config file         i can get it to work using command line and default settings for output and theme but it does not have my project build and version info. the   theme is on github and does work. i am using cygwin 64 bit on windows 7 64 bit.    i have... - checked line endings - copy and pasted yuidocs examples with minimum editing - tried command line every which way - verified all paths and directories exist    help! why is there no errors and no output.
