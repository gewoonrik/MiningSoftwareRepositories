how do i determine the label for a checkboxrow in   for yii?  hello i'm having problems with the labels of checkboxes. when i use more than one model of the same class in a single view the checkboxes seem not to use the names from attributeLabels of that model.    i.e. if i have this in my view:         the checkbox get rendered with a label "[left]special request" instead of "Special Request" as stated in the attributeLabels of the Color model.    on the other hand dropdown lists, text field, etc are rendered correctly.    i have noticed this bug/feature after updating   from version 0.9.12.r211 to 1.0.0.r296.
