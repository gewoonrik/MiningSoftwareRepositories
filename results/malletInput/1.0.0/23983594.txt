 4xpages forms: layout in 'read mode' not aligned  i'm using domino 9.0.1 and have managed to install correctly the   library 1.0.0.201403171254.    i am now trying to use the   form for my application (a very simple crud with edit and delete). i have inspired myself with the code from the 'form' xpage in the  4xpages-demos database.    as far as i can tell, there are some controls that have been ' ified' and some others where you have to surround your xpages tag with a div with the   class you're looking for - and i am not sure where this is documented (if at all).    the issue i have now is that my 'form' doesn't align nicely when in read mode          but well when in edit mode         is there an attribute that i am not setting right (i've posted part of the code below) or was  4xpages never designed with this in mind (i.e. i will have to do separate versions of the markup for 'read' mode and 'edit' mode)?    i'm also suspecting that i am stuck in my notes client development mode of thinking, i.e. read mode, edit mode, with old ideas for the ui, so if you have a better alternative please tell me!
