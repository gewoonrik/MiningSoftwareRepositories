Bootstrap4Xpages Forms: Layout in 'read mode' not aligned  I'm using Domino 9.0.1 and have managed to install correctly the Bootstrap Library 1.0.0.201403171254.    I am now trying to use the Bootstrap Form for my application (a very simple CRUD with edit and delete). I have inspired myself with the code from the 'form' XPage in the Bootstrap4XPages-Demos database.    As far as I can tell, there are some controls that have been ' ified' and some others where you have to surround your Xpages tag with a div with the   class you're looking for - and I am not sure where this is documented (if at all).    The issue I have now is that my 'form' doesn't align nicely when in read mode          but well when in edit mode         Is there an attribute that I am not setting right (I've posted part of the code below) or was Bootstrap4Xpages never designed with this in mind (i.e. I will have to do separate versions of the markup for 'read' mode and 'edit' mode)?    I'm also suspecting that I am stuck in my Notes Client development mode of thinking, i.e. read mode, edit mode, with old ideas for the UI, so if you have a better alternative please tell me!
