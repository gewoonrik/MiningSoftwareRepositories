VS2013 Pro Update 1: SPA web app template error loading Microsoft.Owin.Security  I'm starting to play with VS2013 standard templates for SPA: I'd like to build a simple web app based onto Typescript, AngularJS and Bootstrap 3, plus WebAPI on the server side; among the standard templates I find one for SPA, which is Knockout based but could be useful as a starting point. So I tried to use it, but after updating all the NuGet packages I keep getting  this exception at startup:        Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Owin.Security.OAuth,   Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' or   one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition   does not match the assembly reference      All you have to do to  repro  this is creating a new SPA web application, update all the NuGet packages and run.       I tried to double click the version conflict warning, but it seems VS cannot resolve it automatically.     I tried to add the binding to 2.1.0.0 for this assembly, like (I removed the tags as they seem to cause a mess in this post):    ...assemblyIdentity name="Microsoft.Owin.Security.OAuth" publicKeyToken="31bf3856ad364e35" culture="neutral" ... bindingRedirect oldVersion="0.0.0.0-2.1.0.0" newVersion="2.1.0.0"       but this does not remove the exception.       I tried to remove the bin folder and rebuild all, with no luck.       Could anyone give a hint or suggest a better template for my requirements?
