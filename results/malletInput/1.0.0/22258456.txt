vs2013 pro update 1: spa web app template error loading microsoft.owin.security  i'm starting to play with vs2013 standard templates for spa: i'd like to build a simple web app based onto typescript, angularjs and   3, plus webapi on the server side; among the standard templates i find one for spa, which is knockout based but could be useful as a starting point. so i tried to use it, but after updating all the nuget packages i keep getting  this exception at startup:        could not load file or assembly 'microsoft.owin.security.oauth,   version=2.0.0.0, culture=neutral, publickeytoken=31bf3856ad364e35' or   one of its dependencies. the located assembly's manifest definition   does not match the assembly reference      all you have to do to  repro  this is creating a new spa web application, update all the nuget packages and run.       i tried to double click the version conflict warning, but it seems vs cannot resolve it automatically.     i tried to add the binding to 2.1.0.0 for this assembly, like (i removed the tags as they seem to cause a mess in this post):    ...assemblyidentity name="microsoft.owin.security.oauth" publickeytoken="31bf3856ad364e35" culture="neutral" ... bindingredirect oldversion="0.0.0.0-2.1.0.0" newversion="2.1.0.0"       but this does not remove the exception.       i tried to remove the bin folder and rebuild all, with no luck.       could anyone give a hint or suggest a better template for my requirements?
