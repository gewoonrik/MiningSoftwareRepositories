bootbox with jQuery and Bootstrap with a .net page - no working  If I have a .net page with   min and some other js files on the page, it won't run the js files. However, if I move the   form ...> to the end of the file the bootbox javascript works perfectly.    This won't work until you move the form to the end of the file. How come? I want to use a confirm button to make sure the user actually wants to submit the form but I'm starting with this simple example.
