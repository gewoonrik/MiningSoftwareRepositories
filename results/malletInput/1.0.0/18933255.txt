show text after   slide action using jquery event  i'm trying to make a link show up below the carousel after the slide action finishes for each image (i have three slides) in  . i am trying to use the slid.bs.carousel method and it's not working. here is the jquery i am using, please let me know if you have any suggestions - the div containing the carousel is #stickscarousel (instead of the default '#mycarousel')         i just want to change the content in the p with the id 'stickscarouselmessage to display "it worked!" after the slide action was performed.
