Show Text After Bootstrap Slide Action Using JQuery Event  I'm trying to make a link show up below the carousel after the slide action finishes for each image (I have three slides) in Bootstrap. I am trying to use the slid.bs.carousel method and it's not working. Here is the JQuery I am using, please let me know if you have any suggestions - the div containing the carousel is #sticksCarousel (instead of the default '#myCarousel')         I just want to change the content in the p with the id 'sticksCarouselMessage to display "It worked!" after the slide action was performed.
