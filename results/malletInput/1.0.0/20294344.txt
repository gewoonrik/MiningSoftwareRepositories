reference  -  inside a codeigniter view  i'm trying to reference the  css  files of   inside my views. i'm using  codeigniter  as my framework. ci has a folder for the views, but i haven't been able to reference the stylesheets. this is what i'm doing right now:      !doctype html public "-//w3c//dtd xhtml 1.0 transitional//en" " "   html xmlns=" "       head        link href="css/ .css" rel="stylesheet"/        link href="css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet"/           title              login          /title       /head       body           div class="container"       and so on... but the style is just plain html.    i know there are plenty of questions in stackoverflow regarding this, like  this one , but i haven't found a solution in them. any help would be great.
