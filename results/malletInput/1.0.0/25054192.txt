wordpress multisite child theme showing as broken theme  i am using wordpress with multisite enabled. now i took   _tk theme as parent and made a child theme named as _tk child theme. so basically i have defined the theme name in child theme like this         but when i went to the wordpress dashboard theme section. i can't see the theme. then i went to dashboard network section( as i have enabled multisite) there i can see under the section broken theme the _tk child theme is placed. i have tried both network enabled and disabled for the parent theme but i can't see the child theme working. so can someone kindly tell me what's the issue here? any help and suggestions will be really appreciable. thanks
