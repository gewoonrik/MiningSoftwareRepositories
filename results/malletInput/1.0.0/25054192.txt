Wordpress multisite child theme showing as broken theme  I am using wordpress with multisite enabled. Now I took   _tk theme as parent and made a child theme named as _tk child theme. So basically I have defined the theme name in child theme like this         But when I went to the wordpress dashboard theme section. I can't see the theme. Then I went to dashboard network section( as I have enabled multisite) there I can see under the section Broken Theme the _tk Child Theme is placed. I have tried both network enabled and disabled for the parent theme but I can't see the child theme working. So can someone kindly tell me what's the issue here? Any help and suggestions will be really appreciable. Thanks
