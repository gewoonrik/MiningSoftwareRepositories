Protractor e2e test won't click on button in   popover  I have a problem with e2e testing a web application in Internet Explorer 9 with protractor (1.0.0-rc4). The top bar has a dropdown menu that is implemented with a   popover and looks like this:         The userToolBarPage.btnToolbar just clicks on the menu to open the popover and display the HTML above. Afterwards it looks for the link and clicks it. This works in Firefox and Chrome, but I can not get IE9 to click on the button. It opens the popover, but it never seems to find the button, no matter what I try.    I know the code is not very clean right now, but this is still a trial and error process for me and I can't get any results, no matter what I try. If anyone has a suggestion how I could do this, please feel free to share it.
