using fullcalendar with     in ruby on rails  i'm very much a novice in the ruby on rails world. as a small exercise, i'm attempting to set up a basic (but polished) calendar with tagging capabilities. fullcalendar is working very nicely for the calendar and acts-as-taggable-on is a nice tagging system.     where i'm running into trouble, however, is with using     for nice buttons and layouts. i can't seem to get the gem to actually do anything; my pages look completely unchanged after installing it following railscast #328 (   - -basics ).    right now, my application.html.erb looks like this:       1  !doctype html public "-//w3c//dtd xhtml 1.0 strict//en" " "  html    2  head    3    title calendar /title    4    %= stylesheet_link_tag "fullcalendar.css" %    5    %= stylesheet_link_tag " -fullcalender.css" %    6    %= stylesheet_link_tag "application.css" %    7    %= javascript_include_tag "jquery.js" %    8    %= javascript_include_tag "jquery.rest.js" %    9    %= javascript_include_tag "rails.js" %   10    %= javascript_include_tag "application.js" %   11   12    !-- these are needed for the calendar. --   13    %= javascript_include_tag "jquery-ui-1.8.11.custom.min.js" %   14    %= javascript_include_tag "fullcalendar.js" %   15    %= javascript_include_tag "calendar.js" %   16   17    %= csrf_meta_tag %   18   19    %= javascript_tag "var auth_token = #{form_authenticity_token.inspect};" if protect_against_forgery? %   20   21  /head   22  body   23   24  %= yield %   25   26  /body   27  /html         the  -fullcalendar.css file was shamelessly "borrowed" from brennovich's solution at    /issues/37 . i placed the file in both /app/assets/stylesheets and /public/stylesheets but have had no luck with it.        any suggestions as to how to get this working and/or an alternative to   for nice formatting?    edit:    gemfile, application.css, and application.js are posted in one of the comments below (i only have a limited number of links, sadly :-/)   also noticed that i get an "actioncontroller::routingerror (no route matches [get] "/stylesheets/ -fullcalender.css"):" error while starting the server...that seems important.
