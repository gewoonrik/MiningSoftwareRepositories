using fullcalendar with     in ruby on rails  i'm very much a novice in the ruby on rails world. as a small exercise, i'm attempting to set up a basic (but polished) calendar with tagging capabilities. fullcalendar is working very nicely for the calendar and acts-as-taggable-on is a nice tagging system.     where i'm running into trouble, however, is with using     for nice buttons and layouts. i can't seem to get the gem to actually do anything; my pages look completely unchanged after installing it following railscast #328 (   - -basics ).    right now, my application.html.erb looks like this:           the  -fullcalendar.css file was shamelessly "borrowed" from brennovich's solution at    /issues/37 . i placed the file in both /app/assets/stylesheets and /public/stylesheets but have had no luck with it.        any suggestions as to how to get this working and/or an alternative to   for nice formatting?    edit:    gemfile, application.css, and application.js are posted in one of the comments below (i only have a limited number of links, sadly :-/)   also noticed that i get an "actioncontroller::routingerror (no route matches [get] "/stylesheets/ -fullcalender.css"):" error while starting the server...that seems important.
