Using Fullcalendar with Twitter Bootstrap in Ruby on Rails  I'm very much a novice in the Ruby on Rails world. As a small exercise, I'm attempting to set up a basic (but polished) calendar with tagging capabilities. Fullcalendar is working very nicely for the calendar and acts-as-taggable-on is a nice tagging system.     Where I'm running into trouble, however, is with using Twitter Bootstrap for nice buttons and layouts. I can't seem to get the gem to actually do anything; my pages look completely unchanged after installing it following Railscast #328 (   -basics ).    Right now, my application.html.erb looks like this:           The  -fullcalendar.css file was shamelessly "borrowed" from brennovich's solution at    /issues/37 . I placed the file in both /app/assets/stylesheets and /public/stylesheets but have had no luck with it.        Any suggestions as to how to get this working and/or an alternative to Bootstrap for nice formatting?    EDIT:    Gemfile, application.css, and application.js are posted in one of the comments below (I only have a limited number of links, sadly :-/)   Also noticed that I get an "ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [GET] "/stylesheets/ -fullcalender.css"):" error while starting the server...that seems important.
