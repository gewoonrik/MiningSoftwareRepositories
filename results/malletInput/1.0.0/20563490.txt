Tabs content is not shown  I'm newbie in web dev.    I inherited some web project that includes  , and jquery 1.10.2 (saw in _layout.xml) - not really aware of what is going back-stage (when jquery is used, when   but never mind)    My goal is to activate tabs view that suppose to be (and wasn't working). I've played a bit with the code below, but I get all the 2 tabs content on the same page, and nothing really happens when pressing the other tab ("reviews").  How can I fix that and how this mechanism works (I set id attributes to have the {tab-> content} match and it didn't help :(
