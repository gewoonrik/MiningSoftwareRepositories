tabs content is not shown  i'm newbie in web dev.    i inherited some web project that includes  , and jquery 1.10.2 (saw in _layout.xml) - not really aware of what is going back-stage (when jquery is used, when   but never mind)    my goal is to activate tabs view that suppose to be (and wasn't working). i've played a bit with the code below, but i get all the 2 tabs content on the same page, and nothing really happens when pressing the other tab ("reviews").  how can i fix that and how this mechanism works (i set id attributes to have the {tab-> content} match and it didn't help :(
