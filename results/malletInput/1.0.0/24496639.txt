Carousel not automatically sliding in   3, and the buttons do not function  I was hoping that you guys would be able to help me find out what is wrong with my code, as I have been trying to find the source of the problem, but couldn't.    The problem consists of the selectors, arrow-buttons, and the automatic slide, all do not seem to be working when I try out my code :/     I am using Bootstrap 3, Dreamweaver, and Google Chrome for trying out the code, this is my code as it lies right now:
