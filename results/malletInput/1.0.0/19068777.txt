can't get simple     modal dialog to popup  i'm trying to get a modal dialog to show by clicking a button.  i'm trying to use  .  my button isn't styled properly (it should be blue, but it's just a link), and the modal dialog doesn't appear when clicking the link.  the screen does turn gray when i click the button.  the sample code for the modal came from the boot strap website.  i'm loading all resources from cdn.  this doesn't seem like it would be difficult.         -modal/bs3.html
