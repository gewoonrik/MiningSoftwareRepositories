  3 layout: form collapsing too soon  i would like to get the following layout of my form using  :     working on [select field] [select button]      so: all elements are on a single row (there is plenty of space available for that).    but when i decrease the width of my browser the page switches to a weird layout as soon as it is reaching 767 pixels wide:     working on  [select field expanding over the whole row]  [select button]      while there is obviously still plenty of space to keep the form on a single row. is there a (possibly simple) way to prevent that form to break into several lines?    i copied below the html page used for testing the behaviour described above :      !doctype html public "-//w3c//dtd xhtml 1.0 strict//en" " "   html xmlns=" "  head  meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"       meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"       title test /title       link href="  cdn.com/ /3.0.3/css/ .min.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen"   /head   body   div class="container"       div class="row"           div class="col-sm-6 pull-left"               a href="#"              test page              /a           /div           div class="col-sm-6 pull-right"              you are logged in as abc@xyz.com          /div       /div        div class="row"                   form class="navbar-form navbar-left" role="search" action="#" method="post"           div class="form-group"                label for="id_field1" class="control-label" working on /label               select class="form-control" id="id_field1" name="field1"               option value="1" selected="selected" choice 1 /option               option value="2" choice 2 /option               option value="3" choice 3 /option               /select           /div           button type="submit" class="btn btn-default" select /button           /form       /div        div class="row"           div class="col-sm-12"          stuff will come here...          /div       /div        div class="row"           div class="col-sm-12"               p this is a footer /p           /div       /div   /div    /body  /html       any help and suggestions much appreciated!
