  responsiveness not working in ie8 on a wordpress site  i created my site as a child theme off of twentythirteen, wordpress. i have integrated   and all is working fine. except in ie8. the page is stuck in mobile view all the time.    i have followed the instructions on  s page and included the respond.js in my head-tag, after my css. i have also included html5shiv. but it is still the same, the page is 100% width and all one column.     i have also tried setting the http-equiv to x-ua-compatible. my head-tag looks like this:      head       meta charset=" ?php bloginfo( 'charset' ); ? "       meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"       meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge"       title  ?php wp_title( '|', true, 'right' ); ?  /title       link rel="profile" href=" "       link rel="pingback" href=" ?php bloginfo( 'pingback_url' ); ? "        ?php wp_head(); ?        !-- html5 shim and respond.js ie8 support of html5 elements and media queries --       !--[if lt ie 9]         script src=" "  /script         script src=" ?php echo get_stylesheet_directory_uri(); ? /js/respond.min.js"  /script       ![endif]--   /head       and my less stylesheet starts like this:    i know that respond doesn't work on css imported with @import, but the css in the first import doesn't need to be manipulated by respond.js and the  -import is a less import and the resulting css therefore has the entire  , along with my own, in the same file.     /* theme name:     public web description:    public web theme, responsive and html5 compatible author:         me author uri:             twentythirteen version:        1.0.0 */  @import url("../twentythirteen/style.css"); @import " / -min.less";      i have tried both the minified version of   as well as the regular, and both ie( from compatibility mode and the real ie8. the respond.js is found by the browser, so that can't be it either.     edit:      i'm running the site on a local xampp-server and are therefore not trying to access the respond.js via //file but rather localhost
