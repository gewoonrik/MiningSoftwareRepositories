Bootstrap responsiveness not working in ie8 on a wordpress site  I created my site as a child theme off of twentythirteen, Wordpress. I have integrated Bootstrap and all is working fine. Except in IE8. The page is stuck in mobile view all the time.    I have followed the instructions on Bootstraps page and included the respond.js in my head-tag, after my CSS. I have also included html5shiv. But it is still the same, the page is 100% width and all one column.     I have also tried setting the http-equiv to x-ua-compatible. My head-tag looks like this:         I have tried both the minified version of Bootstrap as well as the regular, and both IE( from compatibility mode and the real IE8. The respond.js is found by the browser, so that can't be it either.     EDIT:      I'm running the site on a local XAMPP-server and are therefore not trying to access the respond.js via //file but rather localhost
