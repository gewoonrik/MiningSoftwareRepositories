Twitter Bootstrap + JSF2  I'm trying to incorporate twitter-boostrap into one of first JSF2 project.Finally managed to get it working following example from    .html     My question is how to get the selected index from the datatable so that when I click on the edit button is shows the modal form with the selected information    My thinking was to replace the normal html href tag by h:link so that I can add an action event to set the selected record in my managed bean,but the h:link outcome is not picking up the "#myModal" reference,the URL of h:link is missing "#myModal" at the end.    Hope this makes sense
