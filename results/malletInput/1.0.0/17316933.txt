    + jsf2  i'm trying to incorporate  -boostrap into one of first jsf2 project.finally managed to get it working following example from    - .html     my question is how to get the selected index from the datatable so that when i click on the edit button is shows the modal form with the selected information    my thinking was to replace the normal html href tag by h:link so that i can add an action event to set the selected record in my managed bean,but the h:link outcome is not picking up the "#mymodal" reference,the url of h:link is missing "#mymodal" at the end.    hope this makes sense
