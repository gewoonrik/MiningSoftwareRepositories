Primefaces & Twitter Bootstrap - Styling of a Bootstrap wizard  I am struggeling with a problem. My jsfiddle output is as I want it:     jsfiddle Output     However, my page looks differently, especially the Product styles:         and it looks like that:         Therefore, there is no real   style in the product area. How would you fix that?    I really appreciate your answer!!!     UPDATE     I guess its because I use primefaces and jsf. However, at the moment I cannot locate the real problem...
