primefaces &     - styling of a   wizard  i am struggeling with a problem. my jsfiddle output is as i want it:     jsfiddle output     however, my page looks differently, especially the product styles:         and it looks like that:         therefore, there is no real   style in the product area. how would you fix that?    i really appreciate your answer!!!     update     i guess its because i use primefaces and jsf. however, at the moment i cannot locate the real problem...
