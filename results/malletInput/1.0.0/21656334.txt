showing errors in php registration form using   framework  I am currently using   framework along with userpie login script on my website.    However,if i want to show some errors in registration form like username already in use,password doesnt match etc. the userpie script displays them at the top of registration form.           I want that this error should be displayed beneath each field instead of showing entirely as one block.I tried several methods but none work.    This is the registration script-         How can i display error beneath the fields.Please help..
