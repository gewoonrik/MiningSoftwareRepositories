showing errors in php registration form using   framework  i am currently using   framework along with userpie login script on my website.    however,if i want to show some errors in registration form like username already in use,password doesnt match etc. the userpie script displays them at the top of registration form.           i want that this error should be displayed beneath each field instead of showing entirely as one block.i tried several methods but none work.    this is the registration script-          ?php     /*         userpie version: 1.0              */     require_once("models/config.php");      //prevent the user visiting the logged in page if he/she is already logged in     if(isuserloggedin()) { header("location: index.php"); die(); } ?     ?php   /*          below is a very simple example of how to process a new user.          some simple validation (ideally more is needed).          the first goal is to check for empty / null data, to reduce workload here we let the user class perform it's own internal checks, just in case they are missed.     */  //forms posted if(!empty($_post)) {         $errors = array();         $email = trim($_post["email"]);         $username = trim($_post["username"]);         $password = trim($_post["password"]);         $confirm_pass = trim($_post["passwordc"]);          //perform some validation         //feel free to edit / change as required          if(minmaxrange(5,25,$username))         {             $errors[] = lang("account_user_char_limit",array(5,25));         }         if(minmaxrange(8,50,$password)    minmaxrange(8,50,$confirm_pass))         {             $errors[] = lang("account_pass_char_limit",array(8,50));         }         else if($password != $confirm_pass)         {             $errors[] = lang("account_pass_mismatch");         }         if(!isvalidemail($email))         {             $errors[] = lang("account_invalid_email");         }         //end data validation         if(count($errors) == 0)         {                    //construct a user object                 $user = new user($username,$password,$email);                  //checking this flag tells us whether there were any errors such as possible data duplication occured                 if(!$user- status)                 {                     if($user- username_taken) $errors[] = lang("account_username_in_use",array($username));                     if($user- email_taken)    $errors[] = lang("account_email_in_use",array($email));                        }                 else                 {                     //attempt to add the user to the database, carry out finishing  tasks like emailing the user (if required)                     if(!$user- userpieadduser())                     {                         if($user- mail_failure) $errors[] = lang("mail_error");                         if($user- sql_failure)  $errors[] = lang("sql_error");                     }                 }         }        if(count($errors) == 0)         {                 if($emailactivation)                 {                      $message = lang("account_registration_complete_type2");                 } else {                      $message = lang("account_registration_complete_type1");                 }        }     } ?   !doctype html public "-//w3c//dtd xhtml 1.0 transitional//en" " "   html xmlns=" "   head   meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /   title registration |  ?php echo $websitename; ?   /title   ?php require_once("head_inc.php"); ?   link href=" " rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"   link href=" " rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"   link href="validation_style.css" rel="stylesheet"    /head   body   style type="text/css"          h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {     font-family: 'corben', georgia, times, serif; } p, div {     font-family: 'nobile', helvetica, arial, sans-serif; }      /style   div class="modal-ish"     div class="modal-header"   h2 register /h2  /br  font color="red"  h4 its free! /h4  /font   /div     div class="modal-body"                 div id="success"    ?php         if(!empty($_post))         {             if(count($errors)   0)             {         ?   div class="alert alert-warning alert-dismissable"     button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-hidden="true"  times; /button               ?php errorblock($errors); ?               /div          ?php } else { ?            div id="success"              p  ?php echo($message) ?  /p            /div       ? } }?                    /div                div id="regbox"                   form name="newuser" id="reg-form" action=" ?php echo $_server['php_self'] ?
