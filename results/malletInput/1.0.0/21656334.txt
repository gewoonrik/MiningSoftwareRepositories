showing errors in php registration form using   framework  i am currently using   framework along with userpie login script on my website.    however,if i want to show some errors in registration form like username already in use,password doesnt match etc. the userpie script displays them at the top of registration form.           i want that this error should be displayed beneath each field instead of showing entirely as one block.i tried several methods but none work.    this is the registration script-         how can i display error beneath the fields.please help..
