integrating    ?    basically, i declare my external css on my template within the head tag. then, if i declare another external css file (being tb) in the same tag all hell breaks loose in the page. however, all seems ok if i keep the two css file declarations away from each other i.e one in body other in head.    is this a problem doing things this way? or should i, ideally merge the two css files into one great whopping file.    all i want to do is incorporate some elements of tb into an existing layout that i want to keep, as opposed to re-writing everything from scratch.    thanks.
