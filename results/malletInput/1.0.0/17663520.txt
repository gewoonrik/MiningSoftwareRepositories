Integrating Twitter  ?    Basically, I declare my external CSS on my template within the HEAD tag. Then, if I declare another external CSS file (being TB) in the same tag all hell breaks loose in the page. However, all seems OK if I keep the two CSS file declarations away from each other i.e one in body other in head.    Is this a problem doing things this way? Or should I, ideally merge the two CSS files into one great whopping file.    All I want to do is incorporate some elements of TB into an existing layout that I want to keep, as opposed to re-writing everything from scratch.    Thanks.
