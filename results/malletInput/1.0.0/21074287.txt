How to use a php script inside a modal  So I'm trying to design a page which can save URLs and when I press submit button, I want to show my saved URL's meta tags, such as title, description and favicon in a modal, using  . I tried using this code:         You can see where I inserted my php script. In this form, the code will return this:         When I used action = "url.php" inside my form tag, it returned this( new page):            So, where am I getting it all wrong? I'm sorry, I'm new to web programming so that's why I keep making mistakes. I know that my code is open to sql injections but I don't care about it that much because it is a project for a class, it will never go online. Thank you in advance.    UPDATE: The code above is working sometimes, and sometimes it gives me the same errors. If I save a website then I close the modal and I try to save another website, it will show me the meta tags of the first website saved or worse, it will give me those errors. I'm stuck.
