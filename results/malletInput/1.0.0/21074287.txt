how to use a php script inside a modal  so i'm trying to design a page which can save urls and when i press submit button, i want to show my saved url's meta tags, such as title, description and favicon in a modal, using  . i tried using this code:         you can see where i inserted my php script. in this form, the code will return this:         when i used action = "url.php" inside my form tag, it returned this( new page):            so, where am i getting it all wrong? i'm sorry, i'm new to web programming so that's why i keep making mistakes. i know that my code is open to sql injections but i don't care about it that much because it is a project for a class, it will never go online. thank you in advance.    update: the code above is working sometimes, and sometimes it gives me the same errors. if i save a website then i close the modal and i try to save another website, it will show me the meta tags of the first website saved or worse, it will give me those errors. i'm stuck.
