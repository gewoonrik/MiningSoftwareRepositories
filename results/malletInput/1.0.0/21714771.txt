Bootstrap modal does not load its content that is on another page  I have a problem with modal in  . The new release that was 11 days ago made me really confused so I need really help because I am not good at this. I have a nav-bar with Contact tab and I want to display its content as modal. But I don't want to copy and paste the same code all the time on each tab. So I would like to keep actual modal on separated page. But after clicking on Contact nothing shows up. I am really desperate with it. PLS HELP. Here is my code:     On main page - index.html (calling modal):
