  modal does not load its content that is on another page  i have a problem with modal in  . the new release that was 11 days ago made me really confused so i need really help because i am not good at this. i have a nav-bar with contact tab and i want to display its content as modal. but i don't want to copy and paste the same code all the time on each tab. so i would like to keep actual modal on separated page. but after clicking on contact nothing shows up. i am really desperate with it. pls help. here is my code:     on main page - index.html (calling modal):
