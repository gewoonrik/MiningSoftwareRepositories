  for sass not resizing icons  i'm using compass and   for sass on a project. everything works well. the only thing i can't figure out is how to resize the icon glyphs.     for example, when   is running on its default less configuration i can simply increase the icon size by adding a      using  this    for sass gem. i'm not using any mixins for the icons.
