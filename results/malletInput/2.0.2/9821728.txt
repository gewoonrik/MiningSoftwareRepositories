Bootstrap 2.0.2 - input-append whitespace  I've upgraded my   version to 2.0.2 and with this update the design of my input-append / add-on construct is broken.    Fiddle:        The Changelog for 2.0.2 says:        Removed all IE7 hacks and floats from .input-prepend and   .input-append, however, this requires you to ensure there is no   whitespace in your code between .add-on and the input. In   .input-prepend and .input-append, added ability to use add-ons on both   sides when you chain the selectors.      I used the   example for input-append. it's the code from github. any idea why it's not working?    according to one of the   dev's the problem is in 2.0.2-wip resolved, but i don't see the solution.
