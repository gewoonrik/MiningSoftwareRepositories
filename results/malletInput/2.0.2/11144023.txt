IE9 Doesn't Adjust DIV Width Until Mouse-over/jQuery Selector Function  I have noticed a strange issue in using IE9 + twitter   2.0.2 for CSS in IE9    When the page renders, if I don't move the mouse, I have DIVs that render with a huge width, I was sometimes able to test it with the console as width of 222448.    If I move the mouse, or for example call:   and it seems to be happening consistently to a parent element (its in Salesforce, so the html renders inside of a parent 'table' within the context of a larger page.    But what selector in   would cause the width of a 'div' to display in the hundreds of thousands of pixels in width!?
