ie9 doesn't adjust div width until mouse-over/jquery selector function  i have noticed a strange issue in using ie9 +     2.0.2 for css in ie9    when the page renders, if i don't move the mouse, i have divs that render with a huge width, i was sometimes able to test it with the console as width of 222448.    if i move the mouse, or for example call:  $('.selector').focus();  or  $('.selector').width()  on the elements, the width immediately reflects the accurate width per the stylesheet.    this behaves normally in chrome,ff,safari, and ie8, i've only seen it in ie9    i am using the  container-fluid  and  row-fluid  and it seems to be happening consistently to a parent element (its in salesforce, so the html renders inside of a parent 'table' within the context of a larger page.    but what selector in   would cause the width of a 'div' to display in the hundreds of thousands of pixels in width!?
