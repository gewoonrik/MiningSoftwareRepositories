Twitter   2.1.1 Collapse not animating when Opening a collapsible  I'm trying to create a simple button to open/close a collapsible part of my website implemented in twitter  . I'd like to use the collapsible javascript plugin, but it doesn't seem to work just right: The folding animation happens "on close", but "on open" it's instantaneous.    Here's a jsFiddle demostrating the issue.           On my navigator (Chrome 22.0.1229.94 on mac) the first time the button is clicked, the h2 "pops in" instantaneously. Clicking the button again "folds" the h2 with a nice animation. Clicking again "shows it" very quickly.     How can I have the animation work "when opening" as well as "when closing"? Should I add more html/css, or maybe change some js?     Also, I've noticed that this happens with jquery 1.8.2 and the latest twitter boostrap. With jquery 1.7.2 and   2.0.2  it seems to work just fine . I'd like to use the latest of both if possible.
