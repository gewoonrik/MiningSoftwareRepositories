  scrollspy seems to be breaking   tabs  i've been trying to implement scrollspy on a page which uses tabs.    this is my body tag:      from the  tag, my tabs work fine. with the scrollspy enabled, i get this error in chrome dev tools:    uncaught typeerror: cannot read property 'top' of null     any idea what could be wrong? it looks like scrollspy is causing   tabs to not find references to the href attribute.     i'm using   2.0.2
