Bootstrap ScrollSpy seems to be breaking Bootstrap tabs  I've been trying to implement ScrollSpy on a page which uses tabs.    This is my body tag:      from the  tag, my tabs work fine. With the scrollspy enabled, I get this error in Chrome dev tools:    Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of null     Any idea what could be wrong? It looks like ScrollSpy is causing Bootstrap tabs to not find references to the HREF attribute.     I'm using Bootstrap 2.0.2
