    on node.js and express  how can i use     on node.js and express?     i know i have to put css and javascript files in  ./public  directory (if it's set default). but when i look for how to use     on node.js and express, i get to know there are many variants on using    .     for example, just put   css and js files in appropriate directories, or specify :       link rel='stylesheet' href='assets/css/ -responsive.css'   link rel='stylesheet' href='  .js'       etc, and also there are two sources, normal and  .min.css  file, each with css and js. so how can i serve the appropriate   file in node.js and express?    here's a first few lines of my current code (is it necessary?), which is not working with responsive design (it doesn't stack vertically when i narrow the screen to mimic the size of smartphones, and instead just scale down the size with each ratio being the same).      !doctype html   html lang='en'   head       meta charset='utf-8'       title  %= title %  /title       meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'       link rel='stylesheet' href='/stylesheets/ .min.css'       link rel='stylesheet' href='assets/css/ -responsive.css'       script src='/javascripts/jquery-2.0.2.min.js'  /script       style type='text/css'           /* large desktop */         @media (min-width: 980px) {             body {                 padding-top: 60px;             }         }          /* smartphones */         @media (max-width: 480px) {             body {                 padding-top: 30px;             }          }      /style   /head
