rails  3 form-controls in grid overflow in phone browser  i've taken the example form from the   doc pages and stuck it into my application.html.erb like this:      !doctype html   html   head     title test /title     %= stylesheet_link_tag    'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track' =  true %     %= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track' =  true %     %= csrf_meta_tags %     meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"   /head   body      div class="container"       div class="row"         div class="col-md-6"           form             div class="form-group"               label for="exampleinputemail1" email adress /label               input type="email" class="form-control" id="exampleinputemail1" placeholder="enter email"             /div             div class="form-group"               label for="exampleinputpassword1" password /label               input type="password" class="form-control" id="exampleinputpassword1" placeholder="password"             /div             div class="form-group"               label for="exampleinputfile" file input /label               input type="file" id="exampleinputfile"               p class="help-block" example block-level help text here. /p             /div             div class="checkbox"               label                 input type="checkbox"  check me out              /label             /div             button type="submit" class="btn btn-default" submit /button           /form         /div       /div     /div    /body   /html       i add   to the asset pipeline and things look fine in a desktop browser even when i resize the window to phone size but when i connect to my computer on a phone it looks like  this screenshot .    the textfields are too large and overflow the right side of the browser. it looks the same in other browsers. if i add col-xs-10 to the div class the form does fit but i don't think you're supposed to have to do that.    to make it even more infuriating it looks like it's supposed to when i use the phone to look at  this bootply of the form .    using rails 4.0.1 but i saw the same effect when i tried 4.1.5.  -sass version is 3.2.0.2. anyone have any idea about what's going on?
