How to make id of elements written by JSTL available for scripting?  I'm developing a web app using Twitter-Bootstrap editable and Java Servlet Backend. Using JSTL to render table data, and hooking up editable data form is not working.  JS developer console, show undefined, so it's not recognizing element id's produced inside foreach in JSTL. Tried to wrap editable JS call on document ready, does not work. I guess the problem is how to make id of elements written by JSTL available for scripting.
