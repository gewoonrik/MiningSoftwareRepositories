How to do a slide animation between two Bootstrap 3 tabs?  I'm trying to figure out how to do a slide left, right, up, down between two Bootstrap 3 tabs.  I have searched the web and surprisingly have not found anything.  The closest thing I found was  THIS  on Bootstrap github.  However, it deals with Bootstrap 2.0.2 and no longer works for Bootstrap 3.    Does anybody know how to slide left, right, up down (any or all) between two Bootstrap 3 tabs?    Here is the basic Bootstrap 3 tab setup that I am using.         Instead of just switching pages when I do a 'show' I would like to 'slide' the old tab off to the left or right while sliding in the new tab at the same time.  Even if the old tab had to slide all the way off first then slide the new tab would be acceptable.  However, I prefer the former.
