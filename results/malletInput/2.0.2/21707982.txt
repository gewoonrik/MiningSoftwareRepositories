how to do a slide animation between two   3 tabs?  i'm trying to figure out how to do a slide left, right, up, down between two   3 tabs.  i have searched the web and surprisingly have not found anything.  the closest thing i found was  this  on   github.  however, it deals with   2.0.2 and no longer works for   3.    does anybody know how to slide left, right, up down (any or all) between two   3 tabs?    here is the basic   3 tab setup that i am using.      ul class="nav nav-tabs"       li class="active"  a href="#home" data-toggle="tab" home /a  /li       li  a href="#profile" data-toggle="tab" profile /a  /li       li  a href="#messages" data-toggle="tab" messages /a  /li       li  a href="#settings" data-toggle="tab" settings /a  /li   /ul    !-- tab panes --   div class="tab-content"     div class="tab-pane active" id="home"  home page content  /div     div class="tab-pane" id="profile"  profile page content  /div     div class="tab-pane" id="messages" message page content  /div     div class="tab-pane" id="settings" settings content /div   /div       i activate my tabs in one of these several ways.     $('#mytab a[href="#profile"]').tab('show') // select tab by name $('#mytab a:first').tab('show') // select first tab $('#mytab a:last').tab('show') // select last tab $('#mytab li:eq(2) a').tab('show') // select third tab (0-indexed)      instead of just switching pages when i do a 'show' i would like to 'slide' the old tab off to the left or right while sliding in the new tab at the same time.  even if the old tab had to slide all the way off first then slide the new tab would be acceptable.  however, i prefer the former.
