    icons not working with amazon s3 and heroku (using asset_sync gem)  i started using the  asset_sync gem in order to use amazon s3 as a cdn asset host  (i am using heroku and ror). all of my assets are loading correctly, except for the icons i am using through     (there is just a blank space where the icon should be).    i tried using heroku's multiple asset pre-processor support:     app/assets/stylesheets/custom.css.scss.erb      background-image: url( %= asset_path "../img/glyphicons-halflings.png"% );      i also tried moving the glyphicons-halflings.png directly into the images folder and referencing it there:     app/assets/stylesheets/custom.css.scss.erb      background-image: url( %= asset_path "/assets/glyphicons-halflings.png"% );       app/assets/stylesheets/custom.css.scss      background-image: url("/assets/glyphicons-halflings.png");      however, i've haven't found a way to make it work. any suggestions on how to get the     icons to work successfully with s3/heroku would be greatly appreciated.      edit:  i am using:  gem ' -sass', '~  2.0.2'
