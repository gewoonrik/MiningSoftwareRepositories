Twitter Bootstrap icons not working with Amazon S3 and Heroku (using asset_sync gem)  I started using the  asset_sync gem in order to use Amazon S3 as a CDN asset host  (I am using Heroku and RoR). All of my assets are loading correctly, except for the icons I am using through Twitter Bootstrap (There is just a blank space where the icon should be).    I tried using Heroku's multiple asset pre-processor support:     app/assets/stylesheets/custom.css.scss.erb
