    icons not working with amazon s3 and heroku (using asset_sync gem)  i started using the  asset_sync gem in order to use amazon s3 as a cdn asset host  (i am using heroku and ror). all of my assets are loading correctly, except for the icons i am using through     (there is just a blank space where the icon should be).    i tried using heroku's multiple asset pre-processor support:     app/assets/stylesheets/custom.css.scss.erb
