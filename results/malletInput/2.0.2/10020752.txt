wordpress     css plugin - updated, now nothing works  just updated wordpress     css plugin to version version 2.0.2.1.     now all my   styling has disappeared. i ran a force error and came back with:         is this a matter of referencing the wrong page? i'm a php noob, so that was really my best guess. thanks in advance for any help.
