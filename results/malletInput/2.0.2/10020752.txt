wordpress     css plugin - updated, now nothing works  just updated wordpress     css plugin to version version 2.0.2.1.     now all my   styling has disappeared. i ran a force error and came back with:     notice: undefined index: page in /home2/mttwbshc/public_html/wp-content/plugins/wordpress- -css/hlt- css.php on line 161      i then referenced that line and it is as follows:     $ssubpagenow = $_get['page'];         if ( $ssubpagenow == 'hlt-directory') {             echo '                 ';         }      is this a matter of referencing the wrong page? i'm a php noob, so that was really my best guess. thanks in advance for any help.
