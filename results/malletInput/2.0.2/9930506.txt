    non-collapsable navbar  i've been building an application using     v2.0.2 as the framework, and i've been running into trouble, because the navbar will always collapse when the window is less than x pixels.    although this is a nice feature in theory, my menu isn't that long and doesn't ever need to collapse.  is there any easy-ish way to do this?  i've read a few posts that state i can just change the responsive css file, but i haven't had any success in either finding what i need to change, or changing the wrong values for min and max width.    is there a class i can use other than div.nav-collapse so i don't have to worry about it trying to auto-collapse?    thanks!
