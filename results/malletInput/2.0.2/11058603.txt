grails     with google maps  im using grails in the version 2.0.4 and have the following in my buildconfig:     compile ": - :2.0.2.25" runtime ":fields:1.1"      so in fact, im using the     plugin. now, i wanna use a google map in my application, but the map does not show up at all, when using the   plugin. when using the map without  , it works totally. the file, in which im using the map looks like follows:      !doctype html   html     head       meta name="layout" content="main"       title youplace /title       script type="text/javascript" src=" "  /script       g:javascript src="googlewrapper.js" /     /head     body       div id="mapcanvas"/     /body   /html       so, nothing special, i thought. but it doesn't work. any ideas?    edit: i created a container called map, which has following css:     .map {     padding: 100px; }      now i can see the map, but the map is not going over the whole page. how can i say, that it should go over the whole page. i tried padding: 100%, but then it goes over the page, but much more and i can't see the end of the map.
