problems with responsiveness when updating wrap-  theme with rails 4  i'm writing a rails 4 application, in which i integrated the looks from  this wrap-  theme .    now, everything worked great up until the last version update (1.4 and 1.4.1). in that, a new data attribute called "data-action" was introduced, and everything related to it isn't responding.    now, i updated everything according to the instructions, and i can't possibly think of any reason why this specific feature-related behavior occurs.    it is worth mentioning, that other than this, everything works fine, based on the very-same updated app.min.js file.    my application.js looks like:         all of the js are loaded in the order in which they are loaded in the original theme.    other than that, i don't know how exactly to debug this issue.    i uploaded the project to a repository in the following link:  repo     any ideas please?
