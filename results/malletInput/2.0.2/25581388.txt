problems with responsiveness when updating wrap-  theme with rails 4  i'm writing a rails 4 application, in which i integrated the looks from  this wrap-  theme .    now, everything worked great up until the last version update (1.4 and 1.4.1). in that, a new data attribute called "data-action" was introduced, and everything related to it isn't responding.    now, i updated everything according to the instructions, and i can't possibly think of any reason why this specific feature-related behavior occurs.    it is worth mentioning, that other than this, everything works fine, based on the very-same updated app.min.js file.    my application.js looks like:     //= require turbolinks //= require plugin/pace/pace.min //= require libs/jquery-2.0.2.min //= require jquery.turbolinks //= require libs/jquery-ui-1.10.3.min //= require app.config                            == this is the application config js //= require  / .min //= require notification/smartnotification.min //= require smartwidgets/jarvis.widget.min //= require plugin/easy-pie-chart/jquery.easy-pie-chart.min //= require plugin/sparkline/jquery.sparkline.min //= require plugin/jquery-validate/jquery.validate.min //= require plugin/masked-input/jquery.maskedinput.min //= require plugin/select2/select2.min //= require plugin/ -slider/ -slider.min //= require plugin/msie-fix/jquery.mb.browser.min //= require plugin/fastclick/fastclick.min //= require app.min                                == this is the main application js //= require plugin/flot/jquery.flot.cust.min //= require plugin/flot/jquery.flot.resize.min //= require plugin/flot/jquery.flot.tooltip.min //= require plugin/dygraphs/dygraph-combined.min // require_tree . //= require final_result      all of the js are loaded in the order in which they are loaded in the original theme.    other than that, i don't know how exactly to debug this issue.    i uploaded the project to a repository in the following link:  repo     any ideas please?
