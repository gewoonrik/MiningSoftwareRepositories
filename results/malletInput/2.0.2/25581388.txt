Problems with responsiveness when updating wrap-  theme with Rails 4  I'm writing a Rails 4 application, in which I integrated the looks from  this wrap-  theme .    Now, everything worked great up until the last version update (1.4 and 1.4.1). In that, a new data attribute called "data-action" was introduced, and everything related to it isn't responding.    Now, I updated everything according to the instructions, and I can't possibly think of any reason why this specific feature-related behavior occurs.    It is worth mentioning, that other than this, everything works fine, based on the very-same updated app.min.js file.    my application.js looks like:         All of the js are loaded in the order in which they are loaded in the original theme.    Other than that, I don't know how exactly to debug this issue.    I uploaded the project to a repository in the following link:  repo     Any ideas please?
