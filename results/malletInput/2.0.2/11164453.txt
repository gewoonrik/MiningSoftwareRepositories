grails     and google maps integration  im using grails to build a web application and want to implement a google map. im using    .    therefore i put following line into my buildconfig.groovy:     compile ": - :2.0.2.25" runtime ":fields:1.1"      to use the google map in my code, i write:      div class="map" id="mapcanvas"       the problem is, that this line doesn't show up, when using    , but shows up, when using no    . the solution is to make some changes in the     css, but in grails i cannot edit it, because its a plugin. so what can i do?
