grails     and google maps integration  im using grails to build a web application and want to implement a google map. im using    .    therefore i put following line into my buildconfig.groovy:         the problem is, that this line doesn't show up, when using    , but shows up, when using no    . the solution is to make some changes in the     css, but in grails i cannot edit it, because its a plugin. so what can i do?
