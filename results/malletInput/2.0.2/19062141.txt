  css file is added automatically in production but no locally as it should be in rails app  okay so this is a pretty weird problem, i have a rails app that uses the   grid and no other   css file. locally everything renders just fine, but in production mode, (i'm using heroku) it seems as though the   css stylesheet is being added, and i have no idea where it's coming from or why it's doing this. it wasn't doing this before and i'm pretty sure i haven't added anything that would automatically include the   css styles. i hope i'm missing something obvious here, but i just can't pin-point the problem and it has never happend before, hopefully you guys can tell me what i'm doing wrong. i'll post my gem file as i think it must have something to do with that:     source '  'rails', '3.2.12' gem 'bcrypt-ruby', '3.0.1' gem 'faker', '1.0.1' gem 'jquery-rails', '2.0.2' gem 'activeadmin'  gem 'rename' gem 'obscenity'  gem 'omniauth' gem 'omniauth-facebook'  group :development, :test do   gem 'sqlite3', '1.3.5'   gem 'rspec-rails', '2.11.0'   gem 'guard-rspec', '1.2.1'   gem 'guard-spork', '1.2.0'     gem 'spork', '0.9.2' end  # gems used only for assets and not required # in production environments by default. group :assets do   gem 'sass-rails',   '3.2.5'   gem 'coffee-rails', '3.2.2'   gem 'uglifier', '1.2.3' end  group :test do   gem 'capybara', '1.1.2'   gem 'factory_girl_rails', '4.1.0'   gem 'cucumber-rails', '1.2.1', :require =  false   gem 'database_cleaner', '0.7.0'   # gem 'launchy', '2.1.0'   # gem 'rb-fsevent', '0.9.1', :require =  false   # gem 'growl', '1.0.3' end  group :production do   gem 'pg', '0.12.2' end      here is my  application.css  file:     /* * this is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files * listed below. * * any css and scss file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets, * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path. * * you're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope. * *= require_self *= require_tree . */      and here is my  application.html  file:      !doctype html   html lang="en"   head     title  %= full_title(yield(:title)) %  /title     meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"      link href='  rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'      %= stylesheet_link_tag    "application", :media =  "all" %     %= javascript_include_tag "application" %     %= csrf_meta_tags %   /head   body         !-- application alerts --       % flash.each do |key, value| %        div class="alert alert- %= key % "           div class="container"             %= value if value.length   0 %           /div         /div       % end %        %= render "layouts/nav" %        %= yield %        %= render "layouts/footer" %    /body   /html
