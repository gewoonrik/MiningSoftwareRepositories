  css file is added automatically in production but no locally as it should be in rails app  okay so this is a pretty weird problem, i have a rails app that uses the   grid and no other   css file. locally everything renders just fine, but in production mode, (i'm using heroku) it seems as though the   css stylesheet is being added, and i have no idea where it's coming from or why it's doing this. it wasn't doing this before and i'm pretty sure i haven't added anything that would automatically include the   css styles. i hope i'm missing something obvious here, but i just can't pin-point the problem and it has never happend before, hopefully you guys can tell me what i'm doing wrong. i'll post my gem file as i think it must have something to do with that:
