ajax load from php/mysql generated   drop down with variable pass  i have two problems with my code, but because i am not quite sure that they are not related, i'll ask them together.    question one: my button group, static + dynamically generated (by a php while loop of a mysql query) drop down loads on the first page load. however, after loading content with ajax the drop down menu does not work anymore (no drop down) and buttons don't react anymore. how come?    question two: how can i pass a variable from my php generated drop down to the ajax load call? the first link (id=1) works, all others do nothing (not even an error). if i make the id static (make ajax calls for every different link id with their own idnr) they all work.    code: html/php:
