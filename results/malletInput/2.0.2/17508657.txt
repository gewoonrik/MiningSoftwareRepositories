Webforms application fails in IFrame when accessed by IE9  I have built a WebForms .NET app using TwitterBootstrap. The app is hosted on a separate domain to where it is actually used viz. apps.mydomain.com/appurl. The application is "embedded" into another website on its own domain viz   via an IFrame. This works for all browsers (including other versions of IE) except for IE9 where the JavaScript stops responding on the page. If IE9 is used directly to apps.mydomain.com/appurl then it "just works".    I get no errors or access denied or anything else visible. Having read heaps of posts I have made sure that:      Both doctypes are the same - in my case    I have tried both      If anybody has got  any  ideas I would be glad to hear them as I have Googled this to death and cannot seem to find a solution. At this point I have to use the IFrame and IE9 needs to work so I ahve to find a solution. :-]    TIA
