  switch js being called, but doing nothing  i'm using   and jquery, but i'm currently trying to add in   switch. i'm starting to go insance because i cannot get it to work. from inspecting the element, it looks as though the js isn't modifying any html.    i've tried using either the gem or the straight js/css. i tried both sass and css from the gem. no matter what it looks like the js isn't doing anything. if i remove the  -switch js file then i get an error (which makes sense), so i know it's getting called. it just doesn't do anything.    below is pieces of my setup:    gems
