parsley validation is not running (even on a plain html file)  i love the  parsley  style of form validation (frontend javascript validation) with beautfiul background-color at the form elements (green -> correct, red -> wrong), but i can't figure out how to implement this thing. i followed the instructions line per line, but it's don't running. maybe my other js resources disturb the flow, so i made a plain new .html site, but it also don't runs there... what am i doing wrong?!    my plain .html looks like that:         i'm leaving the field blank, click "ok", and nothing happens.    i've managed (don't ask me how) that parsley was running for a short time, but without the fancy background-colors... do you know what to do?
