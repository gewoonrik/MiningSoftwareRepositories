parsley validation is not running (even on a plain html file)  i love the  parsley  style of form validation (frontend javascript validation) with beautfiul background-color at the form elements (green -> correct, red -> wrong), but i can't figure out how to implement this thing. i followed the instructions line per line, but it's don't running. maybe my other js resources disturb the flow, so i made a plain new .html site, but it also don't runs there... what am i doing wrong?!    my plain .html looks like that:      html   head       link href="http:// .github.com/ /assets/css/ .css" rel="stylesheet"       script type="text/javascript" src=" "  /script       script type="text/javascript" src="  - /2.0.2/ .min.js"  /script       script type="text/javascript" src="pars/parsley.js"  /script   /head    body   form id="demo-form" data-validate="parsley"     label for="fullname" full name * : /label     input type="text" id="fullname" name="fullname" data-required="true" /     input type="submit" value="ok" /   /form   /body   /html       i'm leaving the field blank, click "ok", and nothing happens.    i've managed (don't ask me how) that parsley was running for a short time, but without the fancy background-colors... do you know what to do?
