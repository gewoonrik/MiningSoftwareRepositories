  dropdown in collapse,  I'm using Bootstrap 2.0.3, with drop-down menus inside divs which are collapsible / expandable. When the drop-down menu overflows the div, they get cut off (but they shouldn't). Jsfiddle to illustrate:        In Bootstrap 2.0.2 the menu does not get cut off:        I found half a workaround by using a css rule as follows:         The 'in' css class gets added by   whenever a div marked with 'collapse' gets expanded.    Unfortunately this workaround breaks completely in Firefox.    Any ideas? I am considering downgrading to Bootstrap 2.0.2, but that would be painful.
