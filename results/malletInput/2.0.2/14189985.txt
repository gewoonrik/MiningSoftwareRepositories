  carousel stops working after first switch on ie    2.0.2 carousel does not work on ie (7~10).    i set it to cycle at the very start.  it will switch item for the first time , and then stop working all together. sending calls using the browser console such as  $('.carousel').carousel(12)  will simply return the carousel container object.    i have added the class 'slide' but it does not work.
