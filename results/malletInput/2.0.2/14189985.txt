Bootstrap Carousel stops working after first switch on IE  Bootstrap 2.0.2 Carousel does not work on IE (7~10).    I set it to cycle at the very start.  It will switch item for the first time , and then stop working all together. Sending calls using the browser console such as   will simply return the carousel container object.    I have added the class 'slide' but it does not work.
