radio button and checkbox wonky behavior in google chrome  within the past few months, google has updated chrome and i  think  has broken radio buttons and checkboxes on my website. i'm using version 31.0.1650.63     they work correctly in all other browsers i've tried (ff, safari, ie9   ie10). i haven't modified my css at all the last few months, so that's why i think it's an issue with google chrome.    i've created a simple jsfiddle that shows the behavior i'm talking about (and an external link to my css file):             input type="radio" name="sex" value="male" male br   input type="radio" name="sex" value="female" female br   input type="checkbox" name="vehicle" value="bike" i have a bike br   input type="checkbox" name="vehicle" value="car" i have a car       i've used chrome's dev tools to disable all styles from the stylesheet but with no luck.     i'm using     2.0.2, but when i reference that file by itself, the radio buttons and checkboxes are normal. any ideas?
