Radio Button and Checkbox wonky behavior in Google Chrome  Within the past few months, Google has updated Chrome and I  think  has broken radio buttons and checkboxes on my website. I'm using version 31.0.1650.63     They work correctly in all other browsers I've tried (FF, Safari, IE9   IE10). I haven't modified my CSS at all the last few months, so that's why I think it's an issue with Google Chrome.    I've created a simple jsFiddle that shows the behavior I'm talking about (and an external link to my CSS file):                I've used Chrome's dev tools to disable all styles from the stylesheet but with no luck.     I'm using Twitter Bootstrap 2.0.2, but when I reference that file by itself, the radio buttons and checkboxes are normal. Any ideas?
