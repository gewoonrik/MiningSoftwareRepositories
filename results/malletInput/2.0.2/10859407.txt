 : accordion collapse stopped working with   2.0.3  my accordion using  data-toggle="collapse"  and  data-parent="#selector" works fine with   2.0.2, but when i switch to 2.0.3 the accordion functionality stops working.    it still opens and closes the  target   div , but it won't automatically close an open  target   div  when another  td  with  data-toggle="collapse"  is clicked.    you can see it not working with 2.0.3 here:        the following code example is also on jsfiddle at    .      table id="faq-table" class="table table-bordered"     tr       td class="question" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#answer1" data-parent="#faq-table"         p  strong what is your name? /strong  /p         div id="answer1" class="answer collapse"           p mark rummel /p         /div       /td     /tr     tr       td class="question" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#answer2" data-parent="#faq-table"          p  strong what is your favorite color? /strong  /p          div id="answer2" class="answer collapse"            p blue, no yellow. /p          /div        /td     /tr   /table       thanks for any help you can offer on this!
