How do I fix a Ruby on Rails argument error related to  -sass gem stylesheet assets?  I have a Ruby on Rails web app based on Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial.  This past week I tried to get a production setup running on a server I own.  The current setup includes Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS, RVM, Ruby 1.9.3, Rails 3.2.8, Apache2, MySQL,   Passenger.    I was able to get the app on the web, but it has an error.  The Ubuntu machine displays the error in the browser (included below).  The error however doesn't exist on my Windows 7 development machine unless I precompile my assets.  My stylesheet assets based on the twitter  -sass gem seem to be the culprit.  If I delete the contents of custom.css.scss the application loads without errors, but obviously has no styling.  If I only include the @import " "; statement in the custom.css.scss file it still has the error.  I also tried the gem  -rails and had the same error.  Let me know if you need more information to answer the question.  Thanks!
