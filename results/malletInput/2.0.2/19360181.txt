Using  -switch in a form with ui:repeat  I have a form that will display a list of products.    Each product can be selected or unselected. The user has to choose his products and then hit the continue(submit) button.    To indicate selection I have used    -switch.org/     My problem is that when the page loads, some products are supposed to be selected by default.    The code I have for this is as follows:         I'm using JSF 2.1 (Apache MyFaces 2.1.5), JQuery 2.0.2, with a Java bean in the backend. If anyone can help me out, or perhaps point out what I'm doing wrong, I'd be super!
