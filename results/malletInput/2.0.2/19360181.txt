using  -switch in a form with ui:repeat  i have a form that will display a list of products.    each product can be selected or unselected. the user has to choose his products and then hit the continue(submit) button.    to indicate selection i have used    -switch.org/     my problem is that when the page loads, some products are supposed to be selected by default.    the code i have for this is as follows:         i'm using jsf 2.1 (apache myfaces 2.1.5), jquery 2.0.2, with a java bean in the backend. if anyone can help me out, or perhaps point out what i'm doing wrong, i'd be super!
