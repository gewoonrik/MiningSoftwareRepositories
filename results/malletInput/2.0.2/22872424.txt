Object doesn't support property error in Metro UI CSS 2.0  I am using Metro UI CSS 2.0.28 (based on  ; added through Nuget) in an ASP.NET MVC 5 application. When I run the application, I get the following error in metro.min.js file in IE 8.     "Object doesn't support property or method 'widget'"    Note that the code works fine in Chrome.    Here's my code:     _Layout.cshtml          I have removed all code from the RegisterBundles method in my BundleCongig.cs
