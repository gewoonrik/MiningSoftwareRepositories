how to implement Bootstrap tabs for each item of Ember's list-view?  I'm using  Ember's   list-view  to show a list of items and I wanted to implement a  Bootstrap tab  to show each item's details, however, I can't figure how to do this elegantly in Ember. Here's what I've done so far:     Javascript:          I didn't want to implement routeable tabs and do realize that I cannot preserve the state of the user interaction with the implementation above, however, I'm not meant to do so in this part of the application.    Here's a  jsbin  of the code above to see it in action.    How to replace the jQuery part so that this is purely Ember? Is there a better to achieve this?    Thanks!
