how to implement   tabs for each item of ember's list-view?  i'm using  ember's   list-view  to show a list of items and i wanted to implement a    tab  to show each item's details, however, i can't figure how to do this elegantly in ember. here's what i've done so far:     javascript:          i didn't want to implement routeable tabs and do realize that i cannot preserve the state of the user interaction with the implementation above, however, i'm not meant to do so in this part of the application.    here's a  jsbin  of the code above to see it in action.    how to replace the jquery part so that this is purely ember? is there a better to achieve this?    thanks!
