    with primefaces (jsf)  i'm trying to use primefaces 3.2 (perhaps it's related to jsf in general) with     2.0.2 (http:// .github.com/ ).    i've added to the starter-example (http:// .github.com/ /examples/starter-template.html) a drop down menu with the following scripts in      the dropdown menu is not working anymore. i suppose it's javascript related, but not sure where to search for this bug.
