Twitter Bootstrap with Primefaces (JSF)  I'm trying to use Primefaces 3.2 (perhaps it's related to JSF in general) with Twitter Bootstrap 2.0.2 (  ).    I've added to the starter-example (  /examples/starter-template.html) a drop down menu with the following scripts in      the dropdown menu is not working anymore. I suppose it's JavaScript related, but not sure where to search for this bug.
