exclude directory from intellij inspection, but not exclude from autocomplete  afaik the only way to exclude a directory is to mark it as excluded in project structure, however, this would make intellij totally ignore the directory - thus it will not appear in autocomplete options.    i do not want this.  i want exclusion from inspections but inclusion in everything else.  is this possible ?    intellij 12.0.2, and it's actually the   css and js failing the inspection.
