Exclude directory from intellij inspection, but not exclude from autocomplete  AFAIK the only way to exclude a directory is to mark it as excluded in project structure, however, this would make IntelliJ totally ignore the directory - thus it will not appear in autocomplete options.    I do not want this.  I want exclusion from inspections but inclusion in everything else.  Is this possible ?    Intellij 12.0.2, and it's actually the   css and js failing the inspection.
