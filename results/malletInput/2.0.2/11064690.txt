meteor margin-bottom with    i'm using meteor with the   package. (here is a chunk of code where my problem is)      tag anyway so it shouldn't be this. i can fix this by forcing an override of the style but i don't get why the margin-bottom is added into the css file itself. is there functionality to it?     edit  its fixed in newer  . i uppdated    manually from 2.0.2
