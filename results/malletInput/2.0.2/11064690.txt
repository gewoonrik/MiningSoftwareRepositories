meteor margin-bottom with    i'm using meteor with the   package. (here is a chunk of code where my problem is)      div class="input-prepend"        span class="add-on" @ /span       input class="span2" id="prependedinput" size="16" type="text"   /div       this is what it ends up looking like         upon inspection i find that there is a  margin-bottom : 9px  on the textfield which is causing the problem    why is this happening, the 9px margin is from the   css. meteor adds the   !doctype html   tag anyway so it shouldn't be this. i can fix this by forcing an override of the style but i don't get why the margin-bottom is added into the css file itself. is there functionality to it?     edit  its fixed in newer  . i uppdated    manually from 2.0.2
