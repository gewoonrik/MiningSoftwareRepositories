dinamically set popover value with href onmouseover in     3.0  i need to made a popover show an iframe using     3.0, it popopver should show iframes based on values provided in links using the onmouseover event of href.    i got the first link working but not in 3.0, but in 2.0.2, but the second link is supposed to change the value of the variable  and show a different iframe and i don't seem to know how to do it.
