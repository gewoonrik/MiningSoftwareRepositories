Dinamically set popover value with href onmouseover in Twitter Bootstrap 3.0  I need to made a popover show an iframe using Twitter Bootstrap 3.0, it popopver should show iframes based on values provided in links using the onmouseover event of href.    I got the first link working but not in 3.0, but in 2.0.2, but the second link is supposed to change the value of the variable  and show a different iframe and I don't seem to know how to do it.
