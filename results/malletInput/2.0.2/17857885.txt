  popovers not working in table  i've included the following in my html file:      h:outputstylesheet name="css/ .css" /   h:outputscript name="js/jquery-2.0.2.min.js" /   h:outputscript name="js/ -tooltip.js" /   h:outputscript name="js/ -popover.js" /       the part that is supposed to make the popover:      ui:repeat var="lowfarecalendersearchitem" value="#{lowfarecalendersearchitems}"       td           a href="#" id="searchitem" class="btn" rel="popover" #searchresult.gettotal()} /a           script          $("#searchitem").popover({             title: "title",         content: "content"         });          /script                                      /td   /ui:repeat       the popovers i'm trying to get to display don't turn up when i hover over or click the button.    i have looked at other similar questions, and nothing i've found there has worked for me.    does anyone know why this could be happening?
