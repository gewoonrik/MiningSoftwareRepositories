Bootstrap - displaying user information -table? row?  I want to show basic user information using Bootstrap 3.0.2.:    First column: First name Last name Phone     Second: Mike Smith 123-1234     Third: "Edit" beside each field (Sorry, having a hard time explaining with this editor).    I don't think a table is the right way to go. But, if use   Rows the rows are so tall it looks terrible. Has anyone does this before or has an example of something similar.    I ultimately want to copy the way your Amazon.com account looks if you want to edit your name, phone etc...    Thank you!
