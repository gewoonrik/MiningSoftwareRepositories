run rake assets:precompile when switching back and forth between   gem versions?  working on a project that started out with   2.3, using the  -sass gem, specifying version 2.3.1.0 in my gemfile. i'm wanting to update it to   3.    here's what the app looks like with  -sass gem version 2.3.1.0:         i checked out a branch to experiment updating the styles to   3, so i updated my gemfile to use the latest version of the  -sass gem, ran bundle update and install.    i have   3 version classes on each of the "amazing point" div elements you saw above, so the styles in the hero unit should vanish, the buttons should go flat, and the amazing points should span 4 columns with the "col-lg-4" class i've specified.    but when i launch the rails server, i get a mix of   2.3 and 3:         the "col-lg-4" classes applied to the amazing points, but the sign in and sign up buttons still look like   2.3 buttons! and there's a subtle, but visible change in the "sign in" and "sign up" text - it's a tad bolder. it's like i've got some weird hybrid of   2.3 and 3 going on.    but now i run rake assets:precompile, and here's what i get:         now things are displaying correctly.    but why do i always have to run rake assets:precompile to get it working correctly? and how could i make it where it would just update automatically when i switch between the gem files?    here are the other relevant files:    application.css:     /* * this is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files * listed below. * * any css and scss file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets, * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path. * * you're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope. * *= require_self *= require   *= require_tree . */      gemfile:     source '  'rails', '3.2.13' gem 'jquery-rails' gem 'devise'  group :production do    gem 'pg' end  group :development do   gem 'sqlite3' end  group :assets do   gem 'sass-rails',   '~  3.2.3'   gem 'coffee-rails', '~  3.2.1'   gem 'uglifier', ' = 1.0.3'   gem ' -sass', '3.0.2.0' end      gemfile.lock (i'll just show the  -sass version):      -sass (3.0.2.0)   sass (~  3.2)      application.rb:     require file.expand_path('../boot', __file__)  require 'rails/all'  if defined?(bundler)   # if you precompile assets before deploying to production, use this line   bundler.require(*rails.groups(:assets =  %w(development test)))   # if you want your assets lazily compiled in production, use this line   # bundler.require(:default, :assets, rails.env) end  module bloccit   class application   rails::application    config.encoding = "utf-8"    # configure sensitive parameters which will be filtered from the log file.   config.filter_parameters += [:password]    # enable escaping html in json.   config.active_support.escape_html_entities_in_json = true    config.active_record.whitelist_attributes = true    # enable the asset pipeline   config.assets.enabled = true    # version of your assets, change this if you want to expire all your assets   config.assets.version = '1.0'    config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false   end end      relevant lines in config/development.rb:     # do not compress assets config.assets.compress = false  # expands the lines which load the assets config.assets.debug = true  config.assets.compile = true  config.serve_static_assets = false
