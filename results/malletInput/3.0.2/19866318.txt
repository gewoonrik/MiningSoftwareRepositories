run rake assets:precompile when switching back and forth between   gem versions?  Working on a project that started out with Bootstrap 2.3, using the  -sass gem, specifying version 2.3.1.0 in my gemfile. I'm wanting to update it to Bootstrap 3.    Here's what the app looks like with  -sass gem version 2.3.1.0:         I checked out a branch to experiment updating the styles to Bootstrap 3, so I updated my gemfile to use the latest version of the  -sass gem, ran bundle update and install.    I have   3 version classes on each of the "Amazing Point" div elements you saw above, so the styles in the hero unit should vanish, the buttons should go flat, and the amazing points should span 4 columns with the "col-lg-4" class I've specified.    But when I launch the rails server, I get a mix of Bootstrap 2.3 and 3:         The "col-lg-4" classes applied to the Amazing Points, BUT the sign in and sign up buttons still look like Bootstrap 2.3 buttons! And there's a subtle, but visible change in the "Sign In" and "Sign Up" text - it's a tad bolder. It's like I've got some weird hybrid of Bootstrap 2.3 and 3 going on.    But now I run rake assets:precompile, and here's what I get:         Now things are displaying correctly.    But why do I always have to run rake assets:precompile to get it working correctly? And how could I make it where it would just update automatically when I switch between the gem files?    Here are the other relevant files:    application.css:
