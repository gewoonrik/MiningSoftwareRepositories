Problems with layout (twitter  ): adding additional column hides the main menu  Currently I'm having difficulties with   3.0.x template: Here is the demo template:          Before corrections the layout looked this way:         After widening the middle by 1 column the main menu have disappeared!  If I change the middle to "6" through the FireBug - it appears. I haven't found what's causing the problem...     Need help. Thanks!    Bootstrap v.3.0.2
