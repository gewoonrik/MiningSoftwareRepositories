panels collapsible reload page instead hide panel | angularjs |   | ng-repeat  I'm losing my mind with this code:         There no chance to get this working. When I click the title of any panels page reloads showing the panel selected but with no visual effects. My code is exactly the same as    example .    I have all jss in the right place (jquery 2.0.3,  .min 3.0.2, angular 1.2).    I also tried removing ng-repeat and doing with a single panel with no luck. What am I missing?  Many thanks .
