panels collapsible reload page instead hide panel | angularjs |   | ng-repeat  i'm losing my mind with this code:         there no chance to get this working. when i click the title of any panels page reloads showing the panel selected but with no visual effects. my code is exactly the same as    example .    i have all jss in the right place (jquery 2.0.3,  .min 3.0.2, angular 1.2).    i also tried removing ng-repeat and doing with a single panel with no luck. what am i missing?  many thanks .
