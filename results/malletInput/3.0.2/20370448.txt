Bootstrap Grid and HTML elements alignment  I have a fixed static top navbar, and then I have another left navbar. I'm trying to fill the rest of the page with text, but seems like the top navbar and the left navbar are hiding it. I've tried placing the whole page in a container class, and then the top navbar in a row, and the left navbar in another row, then each row will have span6, so the other column next to the left navbar would be my text, but this still didn't work.
