Close one div when the other opens - Bootstrap  I'm using the   native collapse functionality Bootstrap: collapse.js v3.0.2 to open div's when a button is pressed. It works great but I would like one div to close when the other opens. Currently, as   designed it, a single button controls the toggling for the specific div. It is good if I wanted to have one button control one section, but I was wondering if there is a way to make a any button in my list of buttons, close any open div before opening its respective div.    I have reviewed this code  * Bootstrap: collapse.js v3.0.2 * in the  .js filebut can't figure our how to do what I want.    Can someone point me in the right direction to help me determine what I need to do to get the functionality I'm looking for.         I don't know if I need to add more code to the file or if I can just call Bootstrap Data Attributes to accomplish this.    I have studied this page:    .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#collapse     Thank you, Mike
