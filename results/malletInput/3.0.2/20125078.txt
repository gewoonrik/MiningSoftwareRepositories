knockout.js &   3 - bread crumb pseudo element  i have run into an interesting bug. the css pseudo element does  not  disappear when it's associated element has  display: none;  in   3.0.2's breadcrumb component.  jsfiddle  to test: try switching the mode in the view model from "mode 1" to "mode 2".    i have a breadcrumb link that i am building using knockout.js. i switch the visibility of the pure  li  or  li  with nested  a  with knockout's  visible: onsomecondition  binding. my understanding is that the non-visible  li  is set with  display: none; .  however , this does not remove the associated  li  in the dom, and i think that makes the css keep the pseudo element. for example, i am expecting the following:     mode 1 / mode 2      but i get:    / mode 1 / mode 2    the relevant knockout code is:      ol class="breadcrumb"       li data-bind="visible: isinmode1()"           a href="#" mode 1 /a       /li       li class="active" data-bind="visible: !isinmode1()" mode 1 /li       li data-bind="visible: isinmode2()"           a href="#" mode 2 /a       /li       li class="active" data-bind="visible: !isinmode2()" mode 2 /li   /ol       the relevant   3.0.2 css is below. based on the   style sheet, the "/" character is added as a pseudo "before" element.     .breadcrumb {   padding: 8px 15px;   margin-bottom: 20px;   list-style: none;   background-color: #f5f5f5;   border-radius: 4px; }  .breadcrumb   li {   display: inline-block; }  .breadcrumb   li + li:before {   padding: 0 5px;   color: #cccccc;   content: "/\00a0"; }  .breadcrumb   .active {   color: #999999; }      if there is a better way to do this, or a cross-browser solution that i am not thinking of, i would be grateful for any input. i would prefer not to hack the css, but that may be the cleaner solution.    thank you    quick links:       3.0.2 breadcrumbs      knockout.js visible binding documentation
