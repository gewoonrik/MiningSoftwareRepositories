XEditable + AdminLTE BS Theme, Completely Confused  Right the problem i'm having is that i'm trying to implement editable into the AdminLTE theme for Bootstrap3, and no matter how i try to do it, the links that i'm trying to make editable just stay as links and refuse to be picked up by the plugin. Here's the tasks page itself that has the table on containing the comments.     Edit -  here's a link to a screenshot of the table containing the comments, i'm trying to make the 'comments' field editable -             The issue is that seemingly no matter what i try, the links in the table just remain as links and aren't turned into editable fields and it's completely defeated me now. Any advice would be much appreciated
