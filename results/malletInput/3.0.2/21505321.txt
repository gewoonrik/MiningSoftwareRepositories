multiselect dropdown using   3 and angularjs?  i am trying to create a multiselect dropdown using   3.0.2 and angularjs 1.2. i can get the dropdown box to open and multiselection to work. however, what is not working is that when i click anywhere outside the menu it doesn't close. as of now, i am treating the "filter selections" button as a toggle to open and close the dropdown box, which isn't very user-friendly.    how can i make the dropdown box to close when i click outside the menu?     this is what i have so far:         i know i need to somehow incorporate  's code: ".dropdown-backdrop" to close dropdown menus when clicking outside the menu.      3 dropdown usage:    .com/javascript/#dropdowns
