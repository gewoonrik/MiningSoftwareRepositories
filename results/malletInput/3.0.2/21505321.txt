multiselect dropdown using   3 and angularjs?  i am trying to create a multiselect dropdown using   3.0.2 and angularjs 1.2. i can get the dropdown box to open and multiselection to work. however, what is not working is that when i click anywhere outside the menu it doesn't close. as of now, i am treating the "filter selections" button as a toggle to open and close the dropdown box, which isn't very user-friendly.    how can i make the dropdown box to close when i click outside the menu?     this is what i have so far:      div class="btn-group" data-ng-class="{open: opendropdown}"       button class="btn btn-default" type="button" data-ng-click="opendropdown=!opendropdown" filter selections span class="caret"  /span  /button       ul class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="dropdownmenu"           li  a href="" item #1 span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-sign pull-right"  /span  /a  /li           li  a href="" item #2 span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-sign pull-right"  /span  /a  /li           li  a href="" item #3 span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-sign pull-right"  /span  /a  /li           li  a href="" check all /a  /li           li  a href="" uncheck all /a  /li       /ul   /div       i know i need to somehow incorporate  's code: ".dropdown-backdrop" to close dropdown menus when clicking outside the menu.      3 dropdown usage:    .com/javascript/#dropdowns
