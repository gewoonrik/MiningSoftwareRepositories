Multiselect Dropdown using Bootstrap 3 and AngularJS?  I am trying to create a multiselect dropdown using Bootstrap 3.0.2 and AngularJS 1.2. I can get the dropdown box to open and multiselection to work. However, what is not working is that when I click anywhere outside the menu it doesn't close. As of now, I am treating the "Filter Selections" button as a toggle to open and close the dropdown box, which isn't very user-friendly.    How can I make the dropdown box to close when I click outside the menu?     This is what I have so far:         I know I need to somehow incorporate  's code: ".dropdown-backdrop" to close dropdown menus when clicking outside the menu.
