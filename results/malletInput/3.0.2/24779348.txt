  navigation doesnt appear in safari  i've built my tumblr theme using   v3.0.2 with  's affixed nav bar. however, upon checking the site in safari i noticed the navbar doesn't appear at all.    here is  my site .     i've read lots about  nav-justified  being a problem or fixed positions but i am using neither of those. i have also looked into  this too . nothing has worked. the only time the nav appears in safari is while viewing it on my iphone.    what am i missing?
