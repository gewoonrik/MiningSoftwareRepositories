Bootstrap navigation doesnt appear in safari  I've built my Tumblr theme using Bootstrap v3.0.2 with Bootstrap's affixed nav bar. However, upon checking the site in Safari I noticed the navbar doesn't appear at all.    Here is  my site .     I've read lots about  nav-justified  being a problem or fixed positions but I am using neither of those. I have also looked into  this too . Nothing has worked. The only time the nav appears in Safari is while viewing it on my iPhone.    What am I missing?
