Bootstrap: White space when scrolling horizontally after disabling responsiveness  I'm having some trouble with horizontal scrolling after disabling responsiveness per the   docs (   .com/getting-started/#disable-responsive ) (running v3.0.2).     When minimizing the window below the width set on the container, the background becomes white when scrolling horizontally.    I tried this:         ...but this doesn't allow for any horizontal scrolling. Looking to be able to scroll horizontally with the background rendered correctly. Any ideas? Thanks!
