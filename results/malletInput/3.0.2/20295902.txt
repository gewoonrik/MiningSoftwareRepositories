 : white space when scrolling horizontally after disabling responsiveness  i'm having some trouble with horizontal scrolling after disabling responsiveness per the   docs (   .com/getting-started/#disable-responsive ) (running v3.0.2).     when minimizing the window below the width set on the container, the background becomes white when scrolling horizontally.    i tried this:     html {   width: auto !important;   overflow-x: hidden !important; } body {   overflow-x: hidden !important; }      ...but this doesn't allow for any horizontal scrolling. looking to be able to scroll horizontally with the background rendered correctly. any ideas? thanks!
