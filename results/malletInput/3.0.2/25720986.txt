 -select - how to fire event on change   -select      -select     hello to everyone. i use    3.0.2  and   select plugin.    this is my select list:         issue    my problem is that change function won't work. it do nothing and i can't find solution by myself. if i put it into document ready instead change function it seems to be working. so i guess i have mistake somewhere in  $('select.selectpicker').on('change', function(){  i try also use only  $('.selectpicker').on('change', function(){  without this select prefix but nothing changes.    update    solution is putting jquery code into  document.ready() . thanks to  kartikeya
