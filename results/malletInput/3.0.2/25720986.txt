Bootstrap-select - how to fire event on change  Bootstrap-select     Bootstrap-select     Hello to everyone. I use  Bootstrap 3.0.2  and   select plugin.    This is my select list:         Issue    My problem is that change function won't work. It do nothing and i can't find solution by myself. If i put it into document ready instead change function it seems to be working. So i guess i have mistake somewhere in  $('select.selectpicker').on('change', function(){  i try also use only  $('.selectpicker').on('change', function(){  without this select prefix but nothing changes.    UPDATE    Solution is putting jquery code into  document.ready() . Thanks to  Kartikeya
