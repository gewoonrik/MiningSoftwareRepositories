How To Disable The .XS Bootstrap Layout In Custom CSS File  I've been given the task of customising certain elements of a site which is using Twitter Bootstrap 3.0.2.    The site will be using default Bootstrap styles and responsive layouts except for a particular custom CSS theme file whose modified styles will only be applied when certain users access the site via certain means.    In any event, I need to disable just the .xs responsive layout and nothing else. This means that the screen must retain a small screen layout on resolutions below 767px.    I've looked at many answers on this site and the closest one is this one that describes  editing the existing  .css file .    I don't want to edit the core   files but simply want to override the .xs layout in a custom CSS file that is called after the   file.    I'm not sure how or what I should be editing as the media queries look like the following and it's a bit confusing to me.         Any and all answers are greatly appreciated.    Thanks in advance.
