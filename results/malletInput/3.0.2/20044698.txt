how to disable the .xs   layout in custom css file  i've been given the task of customising certain elements of a site which is using     3.0.2.    the site will be using default   styles and responsive layouts except for a particular custom css theme file whose modified styles will only be applied when certain users access the site via certain means.    in any event, i need to disable just the .xs responsive layout and nothing else. this means that the screen must retain a small screen layout on resolutions below 767px.    i've looked at many answers on this site and the closest one is this one that describes  editing the existing  .css file .    i don't want to edit the core   files but simply want to override the .xs layout in a custom css file that is called after the   file.    i'm not sure how or what i should be editing as the media queries look like the following and it's a bit confusing to me.     @media (max-width: 767px) {   .hidden-xs,   tr.hidden-xs,   th.hidden-xs,   td.hidden-xs {     display: none !important;   } }  @media (max-width: 767px) {   .hidden-sm.hidden-xs,   tr.hidden-sm.hidden-xs,   th.hidden-sm.hidden-xs,   td.hidden-sm.hidden-xs {     display: none !important;   } }      any and all answers are greatly appreciated.    thanks in advance.
