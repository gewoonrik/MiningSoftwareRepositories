How can I clear input text in   -UPDATED  I have a simple modal in   3.0.2 and it has a 2 simple input type="text" I would like to clear it.

Does any one know how to clear or reset this input text inside a modal when I click on the "reset" button.     -Thank you in advance.    Update: after using @davethecoder solution works like a charm, I still need help clearing 1 of the input text its under the date class:         Any chance anyone knows how to clear this one?  -Thank you for helping me.
