  dropdown menu not working with drupal  i'm using the   7.x-3.0 theme with drupal(7.28) which i'm new to.    basically my submenus do not dropdown when clicked.. nothing happens.    i've seen a lot of people having problems with this issue but none of the fixes have worked for me.    things tried:      checked 'show as expanded' in the menu link config   verified jquery update is loaded and configured (1.9)      below is my (edited) head:         script src=" "  /script   script src=" "  /script   script src=" "  /script   script src="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.2/js/ .min.js"  /script    script  jquery(document).ready(function(){ jquery('.dropdown-toggle').dropdown();}) /script   /head          at the bottom of my page is      script src="/d1/misc/dropdown.js"  /script           my status report has an error saying "the   library could not be found." but the module  is  loaded?      my   library module says "register boostrap as a library by installing files in /sites/all/libraries/ " - but what files, where? is this the problem.. i've tried copying =files to this location without success. i've followed the (brief) installation instructions   they don't mention much.     edit: moved the files into the libraries folder (i don't think this is mentioned in the documentation?) and this message was removed - still no dropdown though.
