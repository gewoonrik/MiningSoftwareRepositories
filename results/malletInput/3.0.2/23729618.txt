Bootstrap dropdown menu not working with Drupal  I'm using the Bootstrap 7.x-3.0 theme with Drupal(7.28) which i'm new to.    Basically my submenus do not dropdown when clicked.. nothing happens.    I've seen a lot of people having problems with this issue but none of the fixes have worked for me.    Things tried:      Checked 'Show as expanded' in the Menu link config   Verified jQuery Update is loaded and configured (1.9)      Below is my (edited) head:                My status report has an error saying "The Bootstrap library could not be found." but the module  is  loaded?      My Bootstrap Library module says "Register Boostrap as a library by installing files in /sites/all/libraries/ " - but what files, where? Is this the problem.. i've tried copying =files to this location without success. I've followed the (brief) installation instructions   they don't mention much.     Edit: moved the files into the libraries folder (i don't think this is mentioned in the documentation?) and this message was removed - still no dropdown though.
