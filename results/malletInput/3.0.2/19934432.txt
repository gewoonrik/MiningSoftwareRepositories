  3 grid system basic understanding  i have always worked under the zurb's foundation logic for my grid systems. now i'm trying   for first time in it's 3.0.2 version. one thing i don't understand is the structure of it.    while zurb works like:       element. can someone please explain me the logic of this? i'm sure that row is there because of a reason, but i can't find it.
