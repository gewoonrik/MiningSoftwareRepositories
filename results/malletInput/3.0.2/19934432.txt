Bootstrap 3 grid system basic understanding  I have always worked under the Zurb's foundation logic for my grid systems. Now I'm trying   for first time in it's 3.0.2 version. One thing I don't understand is the structure of it.    While Zurb works like:       element. Can someone please explain me the logic of this? I'm sure that row is there because of a reason, but I can't find it.
