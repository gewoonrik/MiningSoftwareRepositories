  3 grid system basic understanding  i have always worked under the zurb's foundation logic for my grid systems. now i'm trying   for first time in it's 3.0.2 version. one thing i don't understand is the structure of it.    while zurb works like:       div class="row"       div class="twelve columns"       /div   /div         has a 3-step structure to get the very same result:      div class="row"        div class="container"             div class="col-lg-12"             /div        /div   /div       my question is, what is the "row" class standing for?, on css it only sets a couple of margins and also clear the layout with the pseudo  :after  element. can someone please explain me the logic of this? i'm sure that row is there because of a reason, but i can't find it.
