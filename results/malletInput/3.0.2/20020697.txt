Bootstrap 3.0.2 responsive menu  I have this code, and I can't find out why it doesn't work. The desktop version seems to work fine, but when I use it on responsive units, It doesn't open the menu. Here's my code.    I hope that some of you can help me, because I'm trying to start up this little community, and it won't be such good, if the responsive menu doesn't work. Thank you!
