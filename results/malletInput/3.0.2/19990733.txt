Twitter Bootstrap grid inside a panel  I am trying to use the grid system of Bootstrap to accomplish having an image to the left side while being able to have content (text   other   components) filling the space to the right. The only problem I have with this is that I cannot get the text to go where I want it to.    The text "STUFF" represents the content. I would like the content to be put to the right of the image   not below (the boxed area shown below). I tried using a grid system to accomplish this but I am either doing it incorrectly or I cannot use this method.    IMAGE:        (Note: This screenshot doesn't show everything present in the code, and sorry for the link, I cannot post images yet!)    I am using Twitter Bootstrap version 3.0.2. My HTML code is present below (excuse the inefficient code, I was using this to play around)   I am using the Bootstrap .css   .js files, with some minor edits that do not pertain to my problem.    Additional information: I am using 2 HTML pages (how absurd, right?), 1 (the lighter area) within the other (the main page/the darker/outer area). The HTML code I provide is the code to the inner page.    Also, I would like to know how to have a 'horizontal'
