Bootstrap modal won't show up  My   (3.0.2) modal won't show up. I've tried different buttons, links and all that but it simply won't show up. I appreciate any help!          UPDATE 1:  Here's a screenshot of the warnings in the console.          UPDATE 2:  The button and the modal are located inside a container. Maybe this could help on your path to a solution?
