  3.0.2 - how to keep 2 collapsable navbars but showing one of them only when collapsed  i already managed to have 2 collapsable navbars working perfectly on   3.0.2 - both navbars collapse to 2 nice buttons that allow to access each navbar isolatedly.    the point is that now i need to keep one of the navbars hidden while on -sm,-md and -lg and only show up on -xs.    the easiest would be to set "hidden-sm, hidden-md, hidden-lg" on the navbar (what really works) but we get an side effect of "showing the collapsed menu" whenever i switch to -xs (due to the hiddens set-up) - is there a way to avoid expanding de menu on -xs, or another way to hide the navbar while on -sm,-md and -lg?    thanks!
