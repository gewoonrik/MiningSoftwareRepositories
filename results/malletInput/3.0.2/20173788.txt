  3 hyperlink does not work cause of grid system  i am using   3.0.2 and i am a little bit confused cause of the grid system. i think i understand the grid system, but i'm not sure if this is a bug in   or if i am using it in the wrong way. here is my code:      table class="table table-striped"     tr       td       !-- if medium or large, then print this in one line --         div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6"  a href="pseudo-link" text /a  /div         div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-3" any text /div         div class="col-xs-4 col-sm-4 col-md-1" info1 /div         div class="col-xs-4 col-sm-4 col-md-1" info2 /div         div class="col-xs-4 col-sm-4 col-md-1" info3 /div       !-- end of first line if medium or large --           div class="col-xs-12" text1 whole line /div  !-- always one line  --         div class="col-xs-12" text2 whole line /div  !-- always one line  --       /td     /tr  ...  /table       the problem here is the hyperlink - the browser does not handle it like a hyperlink, when  screen width has the size large(col-lg), medium(col-md) or small(col-sm). but the hyperlink works fine, if screen width is extra small(col-xs). i've analyzed this with firebug and it seems, that the first two lines are put together, like one div (except  screen width extra small).    with a little trick i can fix this, but it's just a dirty hack. if the screen width is greater than extra small, i don't give the second line the complete space:            div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-11" text1 whole line /div  !-- always one line  --       now it works as expected but i think it should work without this trick, too. is my code wrong?    for clarification i have written an example:  hyperlink_issue
