Visual Studio Publishing Bootstrap.Js as Encrypted  For some reason everytime I publish either the  .js or  .min.js it gets published as an encrypted file.    I'm running VS2013 with   3.0.2 and I have decrypted the files on my computer. I have restarted the program re-pulled in the files.    Its really annoying as every time I want to publish the website I have remember to remove the encryption or nobody can access the site.
