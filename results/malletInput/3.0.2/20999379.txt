visual studio publishing  .js as encrypted  for some reason everytime i publish either the  .js or  .min.js it gets published as an encrypted file.    i'm running vs2013 with   3.0.2 and i have decrypted the files on my computer. i have restarted the program re-pulled in the files.    its really annoying as every time i want to publish the website i have remember to remove the encryption or nobody can access the site.
