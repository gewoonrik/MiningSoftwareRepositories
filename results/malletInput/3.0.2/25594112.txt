logistic regression in r.    my question concerns the use of boot() in r version 3.0.2 patched and  macosx 10.9.4.     i want to get the estimate gender-read  relationship between.    in terminal, if i do this command:     `hsb2 -read.table("   ", sep=",", header=t)         i get a message     error in boot(hsb2, glm.out, r = 999) :    could not find function "statistic"    my question is then: what's the problem with the code?     i have the packages installed.    i'm new in r language.    i really don't know how to solve this error...  if someone knows, i will appreciate !     rosa
