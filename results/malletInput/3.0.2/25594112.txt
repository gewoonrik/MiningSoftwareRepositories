logistic regression in r.    my question concerns the use of boot() in r version 3.0.2 patched and  macosx 10.9.4.     i want to get the estimate gender-read  relationship between.    in terminal, if i do this command:     `hsb2 -read.table("   ", sep=",", header=t)     glm.out - glm(female ~ read, data = hsb2 , family = binomial(link=probit)) coef.glmout  -coef(glm.out)  pred -predict(glm.out,type="response") n  - length(hsb2$read) nboot  - 999 a.star  - nboot b.star  - nboot glm.out  - for (d in 1:nboot)  function(d,f) {     #female.star~b(1,pred) - variã¡vel female gerada com mã©dia (1) e probitz (pred)    female.star  - rbinom(n, 1, pred) out.star  - glm(female.star ~ read, data = hsb2 , family = "binomial") coef(out.star) } apply(glm.out(n),2, summary) boot(hsb2, glm.out, r = 999)`      i get a message     error in boot(hsb2, glm.out, r = 999) :    could not find function "statistic"    my question is then: what's the problem with the code?     i have the packages installed.    i'm new in r language.    i really don't know how to solve this error...  if someone knows, i will appreciate !     rosa
