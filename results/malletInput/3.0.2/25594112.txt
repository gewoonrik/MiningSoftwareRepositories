logistic regression in R. Bootstrap  My question concerns the use of boot() in R version 3.0.2 patched and  MacosX 10.9.4.     I want to get the estimate gender-read  relationship between.    In terminal, if I do this command:     `hsb2 -read.table("   ", sep=",", header=T)         I get a message     Error in boot(hsb2, glm.out, R = 999) :    could not find function "statistic"    My question is then: What's the problem with the code?     I have the packages installed.    I'm new in R language.    I really don't know how to solve this error...  If someone knows, I will appreciate !     Rosa
