media query navbar?  i am currently setting up a new app.  i was going to take the morning/afternoon to make it fully responsive with media queries(first time doing this in a real app).      i have     theme. media queries seem to be working correctly. i also have the gem ' -sass', '~> 3.0.2.0'    the only thing not functioning correctly is my navbar.  does anyone have experience with   navbars 3.0? here is some of the documentation i read        .com/components/#nav     i am trying to get the effect where i get the small box in the upper right hand side of the navbar with three horizontal lines, and when you click, the links/options in the navbar drop down.    i thought the "collapse navbar-collapse" would create this effect but currently it isn't doing anything.    here is my current html:
