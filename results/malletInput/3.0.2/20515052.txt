  3.0.2 iframe modal not working  i have tried to use an example of loading an iframe in   modal using bs2, but i can't get it to work with bs3. the modal opens, but doesn't load the external content.    here is the example:  bootply example     this code works perfectly with   2.3.3, but iframe doesn't load in   3. i've determined that it's an issue/conflict with the   .js  file but i'm not sure what it is - i'm not very good with javascript or jquery.
