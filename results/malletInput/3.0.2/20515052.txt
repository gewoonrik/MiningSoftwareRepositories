Bootstrap 3.0.2 Iframe Modal not working  I have tried to use an example of loading an iframe in Bootstrap modal using BS2, but I can't get it to work with BS3. The modal opens, but doesn't load the external content.    Here is the example:  Bootply example     This code works perfectly with Bootstrap 2.3.3, but iframe doesn't load in Bootstrap 3. I've determined that it's an issue/conflict with the   file but I'm not sure what it is - I'm not very good with JavaScript or jQuery.
