  3 not working with angular-ui paginator  i am attempting to use the angular-ui paginator directive in ui- -0.6.0.js in an angular app that uses   3.0.2    i started with the example found here:    /           div class="well well-small"           pagination class="pagination-small" total-items="bigtotalitems" page="bigcurrentpage" max-size="maxsize" boundary-links="true" rotate="false" num-pages="numpages"  /pagination       /div       my problem is that the styles to not get applied to the paginator.  i have found that by including the   2.3.1 css that the paginator is correctly styled.  but, of course, that messes up everything else.      link href="//netdna. cdn.com/ - /2.3.1/css/ -combined.min.css" rel="stylesheet"       what do i need to do to get the paginator to work with   3?    thanks for your time.
