Select all or highlight all Text in an Element  I've been searching high and low for something like this, but for some reason I'm having trouble making it work. I'm not sure what I'm missing or doing wrong.    References found here:         JQuery: Selecting Text in an Element (akin to highlighting with your mouse)     If someone could possibly spare some time would be much appreciated thanks.    I'm setting up a banner exchange for copy and pasting codes using the new   3.0.2, prettify, and select2.js referring to a demo which was found here.
