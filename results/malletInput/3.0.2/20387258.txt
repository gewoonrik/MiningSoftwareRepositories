Add text to Bootstrap collapsed glyphicon links  I have a basic page like this:         When viewed on a small screen, as expected, the nav bar content collapses into a right-aligned button with a drop-down menu. Somewhat awkward, however, is that my envelope icon and off icon look somewhat awkward when they get collapsed into the small-screen drop-down menu. They look good, however, as simple icons with no text on the full-sized nav bar. Is there a way to have text applied to these icon links so that it will display in the collapsed menu but not in the full nav-bar? Thanks.
