overriding behavior in  .js for dropdowns  we're using   3 for ui components. in  .js, there's a  dropdown.prototype.keydown  function (see    cdn.com/ /3.0.2/js/ .js ) that we would like to customize behavior of. the function currently only supports the up/down keys and escape. we'd like to add support for left/right keys because we've added support for nested dropdowns to  .    without editing the actual  .js (not an option in this case), i don't see a way to override this behavior in  dropdown.prototype.keydown  or customize it. is there a pattern for doing this, without editing  .js itself?    so far the best i've come up with is adding my own event handler:     $(document).on('keydown.bs.dropdown.data-api', '[data-toggle=dropdown]' + ', [role=menu]', function (e) {     alert('dfsa'); });
