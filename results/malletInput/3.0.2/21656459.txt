  switch does not work with cdn  i've met an odd bug. i use   switch to make a checkbox on my site as a switch.    but, when i use cdn to reference the js and css file, it does not work. i have to use local file. note that bootstap file with cdn works very well.    this works:       link rel="stylesheet" href="  - /3.0.2/css/ .min.css"    link href="css/ -switch.min.css" rel="stylesheet"       but this does not work:      link rel="stylesheet" href="  - /3.0.2/css/ .min.css"   link href="  -switch/2.0.1/css/ 3/ -switch.min.css" rel="stylesheet"
