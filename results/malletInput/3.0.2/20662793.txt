Bootsrap 3 Modal with Rails 4 not showing  I asked a question relating to this issue the other day, but encountered another error. I have Index.html.erb with a link_to calling the modal. Once the modal is open I want the body of it to include a partial.  Most of my code is from the Bootstrap example because I want to get it working first before I include all my form details in the partial.     gemfile:          Any help would be greatly appreciated.
