bootsrap 3 modal with rails 4 not showing  i asked a question relating to this issue the other day, but encountered another error. i have index.html.erb with a link_to calling the modal. once the modal is open i want the body of it to include a partial.  most of my code is from the   example because i want to get it working first before i include all my form details in the partial.     gemfile:          any help would be greatly appreciated.
