 -sass with rails 4 gives error for responsiveness  I am upgrading a rails 3.2.8 application(contains   but isnt responsive) to rails 4.0.1.     My Gemfile contents are         (in /home/prasad/projects/website/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss:16)    I references  Twitter  : do I need both  -sass and twitter- -rails gems?  but couldnt fix the error. Thanks for suggestions.
