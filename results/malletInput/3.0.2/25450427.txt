Rails  -datepicker-rails not working  I have a Rails 3.2.19 app using twitter- -rails 2.2.6 and  -datepicker-rails 1.3.0.2.    I am trying to get a text_field in a form to display the datepicker but nothing happens when I click or focus on the field.    When I inspect the element I see the following:         I've tried also calling it based on id and have had no luck.  I see the same behavior in Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.    Any help is greatly appreciated.
