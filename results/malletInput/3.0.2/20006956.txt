  3.0.2 not styling forms by default  on   documentation:        individual form controls automatically receive some global styling.      if you look in my fiddle     you will notice that the regular forms are not getting styled at all.    on a project (i have a lot of forms) i added the .form-control class via jquery to all inputs, but it's not working at all on firefox.
