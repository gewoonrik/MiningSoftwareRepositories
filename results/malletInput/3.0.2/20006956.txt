Bootstrap 3.0.2 not styling forms by default  On   documentation:        Individual form controls automatically receive some global styling.      If you look in my fiddle     You will notice that the regular forms are not getting styled at all.    On a project (I have a lot of forms) I added the .form-control class via jQuery to all inputs, but it's not working at all on Firefox.
