PDF Generation Not keeping StyleSheet  So I am using the codeigniter pdf library from:        And it works wonders except, It doesn't keep the style sheet when the pdf is generated.     I am trying to use   to make it look nice, But when I run the script and download the pdf it doesn't have the styling anymore. What do I need to do to keep the stylesheet linked?     My Controller:          Is this even possible with this plugin? If not it's quite the crappy plugin if you ask me.    BTW: This library for codeigniter uses the DomPDF
