pdf generation not keeping stylesheet  so i am using the codeigniter pdf library from:        and it works wonders except, it doesn't keep the style sheet when the pdf is generated.     i am trying to use   to make it look nice, but when i run the script and download the pdf it doesn't have the styling anymore. what do i need to do to keep the stylesheet linked?     my controller:      public function adminpracticesheetlatereport() {     $this- load- view('pdf/practicelatereport');     $this- pdf- load_view('pdf/practicelatereport');     $this- pdf- render();     $this- pdf- stream("welcome.pdf"); }      i am loading the   stylesheet like so in my view:       link href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.1.1/css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet"       is this even possible with this plugin? if not it's quite the crappy plugin if you ask me.    btw: this library for codeigniter uses the dompdf
