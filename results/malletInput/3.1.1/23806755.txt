Bootstrap change navbar icon color depending on background of section (better without Js)  I have my  page  using   3.1.1. My navbar is transparent and uses font-awesome icons and they are white as the background is blue on my landing section. The next section will be my resume (click on university icon) and I use a white background.     My problem is the icons of the navbar are now the same color as the background. How do I make them blue when they overlayed on white?    I've found  this  but I don't know how to apply it with  .    EDIT :     My new idea is but can't find a way to code it :      section 1 on level 1   white icon Navbar on level level 2   section 2 on level  3   blue icon Navbar on level 4      My brain is going to explode
