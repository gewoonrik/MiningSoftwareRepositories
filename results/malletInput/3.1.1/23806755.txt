  change navbar icon color depending on background of section (better without js)  i have my  page  using   3.1.1. my navbar is transparent and uses font-awesome icons and they are white as the background is blue on my landing section. the next section will be my resume (click on university icon) and i use a white background.     my problem is the icons of the navbar are now the same color as the background. how do i make them blue when they overlayed on white?    i've found  this  but i don't know how to apply it with  .    edit :     my new idea is but can't find a way to code it :      section 1 on level 1   white icon navbar on level level 2   section 2 on level  3   blue icon navbar on level 4      my brain is going to explode
