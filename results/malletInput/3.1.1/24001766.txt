Bootstrap modal disappearing as soon as it loads but leaving the backdrop in Safari  I'm using a   modal, it launches as soon as the page is loaded. It works fine in every browser except Safari. The modal will display for as long as a the fade animation then the modal box will disappear leaving only the backdrop and preventing the site from being used.    I've verified   is only being loaded once.    using   3.1.1
