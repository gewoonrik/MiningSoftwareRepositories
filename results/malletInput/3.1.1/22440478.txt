can't make the simplest scaffolding example work  i'm completely new to  , and having a bad start, since i can't even make the simplest example work (!). i have used this  video tutorial  and this  scaffolding documention page  to write the code below:      !doctype html   html lang='en'   head     link href="  cdn.com/ /3.1.1/css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet" type='text/css'     style      .row { background-color: red; }     .span3, .span9 { background-color: blue; }    /style   /head   body     div class='container'       div class='row'         div class='span3'  span3  /div         div class='span9'  span9  /div       /div     /div     script src='  type='text/javascript'   /script     script src='  cdn.com/ /3.1.1/js/ .min.js' type='text/javascript'   /script   /body   /html       obviously, i want just one row, with one div spanning 3 columns (out of 12) and another div spanning 9 columns. obviously on the same row. but this is what it looks like in both firefox and chrome:         is the   javascript loaded correctly?    it makes no difference (not as much as a pixel), if i remove the script element pointing to  .min.js. is that supposed to be so?    perhaps all the css- and js-warning in firefox web developer console?    i get lots of css-warnings, like:     [18:38:44.443] unknown property 'box-sizing'.  declaration dropped. @   cdn.com/ /3.1.1/css/ .min.css:7      and one js-warning:     [18:38:44.629] use of getpreventdefault() is deprecated.  use defaultprevented instead. @       could that explain something?
