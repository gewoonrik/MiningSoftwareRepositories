  3 - item float right in navigation  this is my current navigation:         with this navigation i'm having this:      what i actually want is this:      i've tried floating of the anchor tag but it's floating just inside the li tag. in extjs i'm having the '->' item which provides me this behavior. how can i do this?    i'm using   3.1.1.    thank you. :)
