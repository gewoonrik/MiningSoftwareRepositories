how to implement responsive, independently scrolling panes in   3?  i'm working on a web app for which i want to have two independently scrollable areas on larger screens: a main content area on the left, and a smaller sidebar on the right.    i've managed to implement such a layout in css using   positioning for the larger screen layout.    how can i attempt to tackle this problem?
