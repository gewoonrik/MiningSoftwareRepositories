How to implement responsive, independently scrolling panes in Bootstrap 3?  I'm working on a web app for which I want to have two independently scrollable areas on larger screens: a main content area on the left, and a smaller sidebar on the right.    I've managed to implement such a layout in CSS using   positioning for the larger screen layout.    How can I attempt to tackle this problem?
