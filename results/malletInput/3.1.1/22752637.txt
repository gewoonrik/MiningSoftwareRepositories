how to implement responsive, independently scrolling panes in   3?  i'm working on a web app for which i want to have two independently scrollable areas on larger screens: a main content area on the left, and a smaller sidebar on the right.    i've managed to implement such a layout in css using  absolute  positioning and  overflow  properties, see this jsfiddle:        this is great, however i'm also attempting to make use of   (3.1.1) in order to make the site responsive and for the components/styling. however i'm at a loss at how to do so.    basically, i'd ideally like to use   conventions (the column classes etc.) to make it so that on mobile screens the right pane collapses below the left pane (or disappears entirely) for a conventional vertical layout, with both taking up the full width. however it seems impossible to do this while using  absolute  positioning for the larger screen layout.    how can i attempt to tackle this problem?
