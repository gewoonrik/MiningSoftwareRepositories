xpages   3.1.1 and font-awesome 4.1.0 combined in a theme not working  i added the files for   and font-awesome to my webcontent folder and modified the urls in the font-awesome .css file as recommended.    then i created a   theme, which pulls in all the required   files (.css, .js), jquery and the font-awesome .css file.    however, when i try to use a font-awesome icon (i-tag with class fa fa-icon-name), the icon is not being rendered (ie8/9 and firefox 30).    when i deactivate the theme and add the font-awesome .css file as a resource directly to my xpage, it works.    might the issue be caused by the order i am pulling in the different files in my theme?         any help would be highly appreciated.    thank you.    daniel
