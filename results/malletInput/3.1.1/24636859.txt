XPages Bootstrap 3.1.1 and Font-Awesome 4.1.0 combined in a theme not working  I added the files for   and font-awesome to my WebContent folder and modified the urls in the font-awesome .css file as recommended.    Then I created a   theme, which pulls in all the required   files (.css, .js), jquery and the font-awesome .css file.    However, when I try to use a font-awesome icon (i-tag with class fa fa-icon-name), the icon is not being rendered (IE8/9 and Firefox 30).    When I deactivate the theme and add the font-awesome .css file as a resource directly to my Xpage, it works.    Might the issue be caused by the order I am pulling in the different files in my theme?         Any help would be highly appreciated.    Thank you.    Daniel
