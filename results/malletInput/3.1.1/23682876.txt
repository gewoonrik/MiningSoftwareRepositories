centering the row in   with a minimum width  i have a bit of a silly question regards   as i seem to have lost my mind today... anyway i wish to set the background colour of my  container-fluid  div so that it spans the full width of the page. however i wish for the child  row-fluid  div to sit in the middle of the parent with a minimum width of (for example: 970px). the  row-fluid  div will contain various  col-*  divs. this picture may help:         in my html i have the following structure:         div class="container-fluid text-center header"          div class="row"   !-- when i use class="row-fluid" i lose the centering --               div class="col-xs-3" logo /div   !-- i have used the col-md-* class too) --               div class="col-xs-3" dropdown /div               div class="col-xs-3" telephone /div               div class="col-xs-3" local /div           /div       /div       and this is my css ( notice i am using the text-center class provided by  )      .header .row {   margin: auto;   float: none;   width: 970px;   text-align: left; }      now this works although i really want to use the responsive aspects of the   grid and when i resize the window the site isn't responsive. i know for this i should use the  row-fluid  class to achieve this but then i lose my centering effect. perhaps i should use offsets, does anyone have an ideas how i can achieve what i want? i also realise that my code has 4 columns and my image has 3 cols. thanks in advance. i am using   3.1.1
