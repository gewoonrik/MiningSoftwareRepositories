centering the row in   with a minimum width  i have a bit of a silly question regards   as i seem to have lost my mind today... anyway i wish to set the background colour of my   class to achieve this but then i lose my centering effect. perhaps i should use offsets, does anyone have an ideas how i can achieve what i want? i also realise that my code has 4 columns and my image has 3 cols. thanks in advance. i am using   3.1.1
