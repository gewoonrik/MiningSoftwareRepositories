Centering the row in Bootstrap with a minimum width  I have a bit of a silly question regards   as I seem to have lost my mind today... anyway I wish to set the background colour of my   class to achieve this but then I lose my centering effect. Perhaps I should use offsets, does anyone have an ideas how I can achieve what I want? I also realise that my code has 4 columns and my image has 3 cols. Thanks in advance. I am using Bootstrap 3.1.1
