popup contact or modal form freezes, django + twitter   + bootsnipp  I'm quite new to django and web programming in general. I want to build a small website example. I use django allauth and twitter  . However, I wanted to build a popup sign in, register window, which I couldn't find in twitter bootsrap examples. So I took a snippet from  bootsnipp , because it works exactly as I want: popups over other forms, while fading them, so I thought with a little tuning it will work for me.
