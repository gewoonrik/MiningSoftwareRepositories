  3.1.1 col-sm-offset-1 applying to col-md-5  the   col-sm-offset-1 is applying to my md sized columns.  is anyone else having this issue and if so have you found a work around.  the issue is on the second set of columns.  the col-sm-offset-1 should not apply to col-md-5 only to col-sm-10 but it is.
