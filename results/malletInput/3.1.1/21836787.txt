Bootstrap 3.1.1 col-sm-offset-1 applying to col-md-5  The   col-sm-offset-1 is applying to my md sized columns.  Is anyone else having this issue and if so have you found a work around.  The issue is on the second set of columns.  The col-sm-offset-1 should not apply to col-md-5 only to col-sm-10 but it is.
