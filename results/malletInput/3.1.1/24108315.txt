  styles not applying within a shadow dom on chrome 35  i've working with   3.1.1 and polymer 0.2.4 for a long time and, suddenly -it may have been since the last chrome auto-update (version 35.0.1916.114)-   stopped styling shadow dom elements. i've been able to check that the css classes within those nodes do not appear when inspecting the (shadow) dom with chrome devtools. in other browsers, such as firefox, it is still working.     i don't know whether this is something i'm missing or some kind of bug, but this odd styling behaviour can be seen too directly on jsbin. i'm including two adapted chunks of code extracted from an actual component to illustrate my problem:           (working example)       (non-working example)      please, notice that what i wanted to stress in the previous examples were just the differences between how css styling is being applied (or not).     thanks in advance,    nacho    p.s. i've also checked it with polymer 0.3.1 with the same result.
