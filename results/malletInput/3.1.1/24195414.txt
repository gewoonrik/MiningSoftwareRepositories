Layout issue when updating twitter-  from 3.0.0 to 3.1.1  I have a website that uses twitter-  for responsive layout. I upgraded from version 3.0.0 to 3.1.1 and my layout has changed and I can't figure out why.    Here's some simplified JSFiddles that show the issue:     JSFiddle - Working with 3.0.0      JSFiddle - Failing with 3.1.1     The only difference in these fiddles is the   version. I've reviewed the   releases  , but can't see anything obvious that has caused this issue.    Apologies for the amount of code/css, I've tried to trim it down to the bare minimum.
