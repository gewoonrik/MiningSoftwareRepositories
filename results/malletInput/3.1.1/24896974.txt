modify   less files to use an id selector  briefly, what i'm trying to do is apply a custom id selector on top of  .css so that i don't break other css on a website. so this :         what's really gross about that is the amount of customization that i'll have to do in order to "fix" all of the   css so it uses my id selector. so i'm still looking for a better solution...
