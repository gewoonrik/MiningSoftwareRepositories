force enabled look to readonly input with   css  i have an app using   .css  for the design. i have a readonly input which looks like disabled because of   (cursor not allowed, background color grey etc...). i would like the input to look enabled with readonly activated.    how can i do that?     edit  (adding more code):    header:     doctype html html(ng-app='myapp')   head     title=title     link(rel='stylesheet' href='stylesheets/ .min-3.1.1.css')     link(rel='stylesheet' href='stylesheets/style.css')      my input:  input.form-control(readonly, placeholder='jj-mm-aaaa')     my stylus (style.css):     input[readonly]   background-color: #fff
