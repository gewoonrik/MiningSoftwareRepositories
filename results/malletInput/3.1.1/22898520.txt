Bootstrap (v3.1.1) modal not displaying  I've looked around at the various solutions but can't seem to get this working. I've used the following code to create a modal:         When I click the "Add speaker" button, all that happens is that the page darkens as though the modal will appear but it never shows up. any ideas? Thanks! (Yes, I've added the  .min.js file).
