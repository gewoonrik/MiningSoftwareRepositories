can i make different forms appear dependent on what the screen size is?  so on my registration .php screen, i have a form in that phone a table, in the table there is 2 columns and about 5 rows the table basically set out like this ...     | first name | last name | |  username  | verifier* | |  password  | verifier* | | retype pass| verifier* | |    city    |  country  | |genderselect|dateofbirth| |  clearbtn  | submitbtn |      so that's the original form, on the larger screen so i'm using   v3.1.1, so it has responsive web desgin built in, but when i use a tablet and smartphone, i just cant work out how to get the form to appear in a specific way, in a perfect situation, i would get rid of the table, and have just the  form . id have each  input  field on a single line, then a   br   and where i have the verifiers, to check if the username is already in the system, if the email is currently registered part of the db, and if the password is at a decent strength to avoid people accessing your account. so the verifiers sit in the same line as the input field with just a space between them.    an ideal situation for me would be as simple as...     if (screen size is   x      y) {     include 'includes/reg/form1'; } if (screen size is   y) {     include 'includes/reg/form2'; }      but im guessing it wont be as easy as that, does anyone have any suggestions that could help with this??
