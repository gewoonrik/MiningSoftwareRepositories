Bootstrap Scaffolding Span  Super beginner at this but I'm having Bootstrap issues that I can't find answers to online. The spans I've created don't break into parts of 12. They all appear to be uniform but I know I've installed this correctly because I was able to create buttons earlier. Help! What am I doing wrong?
