  dropdown with scrollable selection list  i am trying to make a dropdown list that has two commands (sort asc and sort des) that will be executed on one click and is listed at the top followed by a section under "choose filtering", that has a command "toggle all" (that does not close the dropdownlist) and a scrollable list of names (that does not scroll the commands at the top) that can be selected with help of checkboxes.    i have come a good way with this, the part that i can't make happen is the the scroll of only names. when i try to implement the checkboxes then the names change appearance, i want them with the checkbox aligned with the other commands then a padding and then the name (not boled). but i get left alinged boxes, no padding and bold names. and then the scrollbar, i can't set it over just the names, it goes over all the dropdown-menu or i get a separate scroll for each name is in the coed below. i want to make a subclass to :  that allows me to set the scrollbar for just those menuitems.    i have experimented with div:s and class on labels, but i can't figure it out. please help me get this right.    html
