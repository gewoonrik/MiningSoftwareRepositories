Bootstrap dropdown with scrollable selection list  I am trying to make a dropdown list that has two commands (Sort asc and Sort des) that will be executed on one click and is listed at the top followed by a section under "Choose Filtering", that has a command "Toggle All" (that does not close the dropdownlist) and a scrollable list of names (that does not scroll the commands at the top) that can be selected with help of checkboxes.    I have come a good way with this, the part that I can't make happen is the the scroll of only names. When I try to implement the checkboxes then the names change appearance, I want them with the checkbox aligned with the other commands then a padding and then the name (not boled). But I get left alinged boxes, no padding and bold names. And then the scrollbar, I can't set it over just the names, it goes over all the dropdown-menu or I get a separate scroll for each name is in the coed below. I want to make a subclass to :  that allows me to set the scrollbar for just those menuitems.    I have experimented with div:s and class on labels, but I can't figure it out. Please help me get this right.    HTML
