  tooltip on ipad - refuses to close despite offical example working  using   tooltips on my website has been widely hailed by my testers are really useful, but i'm experiencing some bad behaviour on my ipad in chrome and safari.    i just want the tooltips to close if you click them on the touch screen.    this actually happens when i trigger tooltips on the official example here:    .com/javascript/#tooltips     but using the simplest of examples below, my tooltips do not close on my ipad. so what is different? is it down to the options being passed to tooltip() ?    i'm using 3.1.1
