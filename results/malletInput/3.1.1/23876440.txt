  menu hover  i found one problem with menu in     3 (3.1.1). tab "kontakt" is a  "li" class="active">kontakt "/li"> and tab "galeria zdjä™ä‡" is a  "li">galeria zdjä™ä‡ "/li"> (without brackets before and after li). how can i avoid this situation?        as you can see shadow from "galeria zdjä™ä‡" is behind tab "kontakt". is it possible to change this that shadow would be before next tab?    thanks in advance.
