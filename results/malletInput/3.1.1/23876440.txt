Bootstrap menu hover  I found one problem with menu in Twitter Bootstrap 3 (3.1.1). Tab "kontakt" is a  "li" class="active">Kontakt "/li"> and tab "Galeria zdjęć" is a  "li">Galeria zdjęć "/li"> (without brackets before and after li). How can I avoid this situation?        As You can see shadow from "Galeria zdjęć" is behind tab "Kontakt". Is it possible to change this that shadow would be before next tab?    Thanks in advance.
