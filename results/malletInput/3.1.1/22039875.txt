*some* media queries ignored in all versions of ie  dear fellow front end devs:    i am having a hair raising problem with ie not listening to my media queries. i am using   3.1.1. the website works perfectly in ff and chrome. however, all version of ie (including the latest v11, downloaded yesterday) are showing problems.    i have scoured the internet for answers, it seems nobody else is having this problem, therefore i've probably done something wrong.    to reproduce this problem, try opening this page in chrome and ie: cre8veonline.com/wold/000.html    and try resizing the windows to ~800px (small device media query for  ) you will see what it is supposed to look like on chrome, and what ie displays.    if you right click on the facebook box / inspect element, you will see a parent element called ".duperman". this element has a padding-top: 40px on default (extra small devices) and padding-top: 200px on small devices. it overrides the 40px for 200px nicely on chrome, but completely ignores it in ie.    i've tried using !important - no result. i've tried adding a background color on the small device media query, to see if it recognises it at all - no result.    yet other responsive functions work - such as the column resizing and "visible-xs" etc.    if anyone can shed some light on this i would be very delighted and grateful!
