had to change all media queries in   to work with respond.js. why?  so i'm using   3.1.1 and respond.js, and while the respond was clearly loading, they weren't playing nice until i went and changed all the media queries in boostrap from         why was this necessary?  it seems like either i've missed something or one of the two sources needs to change their code, cause the   documentation indicates they should play nicely out of the box, as it were.    any clarification on this issue would be appreciated.
