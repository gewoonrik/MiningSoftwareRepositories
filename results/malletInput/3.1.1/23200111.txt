what is causing a site to hang before first byte  i was developing on a local laravel 4.1 site (specifically  andrewelkins/laravel-4- -starter-site  package) when the site suddenly refused to load. it hangs without loading any data. the only thing i changed between then was updating   to 3.1.1. i thought perhaps this did it, so i reverted back to 3.0.0, but that didn't fix the problem.    i can access the local url and see xdebug dump a profile for the site, which goes to completion, however, nothing shows in the browser. headers aren't even transmitted according to http headers chrome ext. google speedtracer also shows no network activity.    however, if i introduce syntax errors anywhere in the code, i get a nice clean exception error that loads right up in whoops.    is there a fitting tool i can use to track down exactly what file is causing the browser load to hang from the first byte?
