  3.1.1 navbar form feedback misaligned  on screens >=768px, everything works great. when a user inputs an incorrect username or password, the form fields glow red/yellow/green and get a little glyphicon toward the right side. if you resize smaller than 768px, it switches to the mobile view including a collapsible navbar (where my login form is). on the collapsed navbar, the feedback glyphicons are below the form fields rather than inside of them.    the php controls what state to make the fields after doing the login check against mysql. lines like this      the css is unaltered   3.1.1. how can i get the small view to work correctly like the other views?    thanks in advance!
