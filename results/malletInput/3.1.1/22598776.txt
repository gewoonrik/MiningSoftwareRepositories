center figures in   3.1.1  hi i am having trouble centering these figures.  .col-centered  is working on every other section that i have except for this one.       section id="leadership" class="row col-md-7 company-leadership full-page col-centered"        h2 class="about-title text-center" leadership /h2        figure class="cap-bot col-md-2 team"             img src=" " class="img-responsive"             figcaption                  h3 jon doe /h3                  em title /em             /figcaption        /figure         figure class="cap-bot col-md-2 team"             img src=" " class="img-responsive"             figcaption                   h3 jon doe /h3                   em title /em             /figcaption        /figure         figure class="cap-bot col-md-2 team"             img src=" " class="img-responsive"             figcaption                 h3 jon doe /h3                 em title /em             /figcaption        /figure   /section       css:     .col-centered{ float: none; margin: 0 auto; }      here is jsfiddle:           btw - you might not be able to see the 3 figures inline because of your resolution so zoom out until you see the 3 figures under leadership. i want them inline but centered right under leadership. thanks!
