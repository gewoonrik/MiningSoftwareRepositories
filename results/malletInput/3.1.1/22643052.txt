PHP login script no redirect and update div  I'm attempting to get a login page to run a php script (that uses an API to send a curl request to a server) and returns a JSON response, after using the login script I don't want the page to refresh. I just want the entire navbar to refresh.    Currently it goes through the AJAX and does not load the php page, that portion works. Any guidance would be much appreciated.    I'm using the following: Bootstrap 3.1.1 PHP 5.4    Bootstrap Nav Form
