Arrows/images between   columns  I have 3 images within a row. Between each column, i'd like to add an arrow pointing to the next image.    How can I do this, while keep the existing images centered (so the middle one is in the middle of the page), and so it degrades nicely on smaller screens (disappears for instance)?    html:         EDIT: For clarification, I want to add arrows between the existing images in the html code above. The html/css above is already centered. Howver, i'd like to  add  2 arrows between the 3 existing images.      EDIT: Please see this image to understand what I mean:        EDIT: Changed html to show a full example, including css call.
