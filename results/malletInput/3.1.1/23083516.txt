arrows/images between   columns  i have 3 images within a row. between each column, i'd like to add an arrow pointing to the next image.    how can i do this, while keep the existing images centered (so the middle one is in the middle of the page), and so it degrades nicely on smaller screens (disappears for instance)?    html:         edit: for clarification, i want to add arrows between the existing images in the html code above. the html/css above is already centered. howver, i'd like to  add  2 arrows between the 3 existing images.      edit: please see this image to understand what i mean:        edit: changed html to show a full example, including css call.
