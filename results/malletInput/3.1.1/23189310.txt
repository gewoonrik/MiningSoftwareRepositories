Twitter  : Wrong heigth of button with icon and without text  There are two buttons on simple html page with attached twitter-  2/3: with and without text.  If I open it, button without text has wrong  smaller height  (See screenshot below).        How comes it?  Same situation repeats in IE 9\10. But if run in  jsfiddle , all is fine. Even if i add a button in manualy via developer toolbar in some page with TB in internet all is ok.    P.S.: same thing with   2...         What am I doing wrong?
