Bootstrap accordion only auto-collapsing one panel  I've been scratching my head on this for the past 2 hours.  I have an accordion with two panels.  I want the first panel to be expanded by default.  When the collapsed panel's header is clicked, I want that panel to expand and the other to collapse.  It only works in certain situations for the second panel.    Here is a  JSFiddle .    Here is my markup:         I'm using Bootstrap v3.1.1 and jQuery v1.10.4.
