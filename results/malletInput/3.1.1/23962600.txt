  accordion only auto-collapsing one panel  i've been scratching my head on this for the past 2 hours.  i have an accordion with two panels.  i want the first panel to be expanded by default.  when the collapsed panel's header is clicked, i want that panel to expand and the other to collapse.  it only works in certain situations for the second panel.    here is a  jsfiddle .    here is my markup:         i'm using   v3.1.1 and jquery v1.10.4.
