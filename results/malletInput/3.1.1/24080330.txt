Bootstrap 3 and jquery issues  There seems to be some problem with the version of   that comes with Visual studio 2013 or maybe there is something wrong with my implementation. I have used the materials available on  get .com  and have this  JSFiddle here  As you can see I am able to get the button dropdown to work, but not the tooltip when in JSFiddle. However, when I run the same code in a visual studio MVC 5 project, the button dropdown also doesnt work. The button click doesnt pull down a menu and the tool tip doesnt show. Only the css shows, but the Javascript doesnt seem to be working. On my Chrome console I get this error.      Here is the page source of my simple MVC 5 page.           EDIT  Added the tooltip separately in  JSFiddle here      I got this tooltip code from  the example here
