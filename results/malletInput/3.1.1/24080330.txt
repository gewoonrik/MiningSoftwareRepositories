  3 and jquery issues  there seems to be some problem with the version of   that comes with visual studio 2013 or maybe there is something wrong with my implementation. i have used the materials available on  get .com  and have this  jsfiddle here  as you can see i am able to get the button dropdown to work, but not the tooltip when in jsfiddle. however, when i run the same code in a visual studio mvc 5 project, the button dropdown also doesnt work. the button click doesnt pull down a menu and the tool tip doesnt show. only the css shows, but the javascript doesnt seem to be working. on my chrome console i get this error.      here is the page source of my simple mvc 5 page.           edit  added the tooltip separately in  jsfiddle here      i got this tooltip code from  the example here
