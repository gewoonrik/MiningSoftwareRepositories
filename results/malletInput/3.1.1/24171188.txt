prioritize / ignore css rules when working with external css files (kendo ui and  )       i understand that because the kendo file has more specific selectors, it'll take those rules. i would like to just completely ignore rules for .km-button (which is added by using data-role="button" on my button),  so it uses  's rules instead of kendo's .    i could remove the class name dynamically using jquery, but i'm wondering if it can be done some other way.    thanks
