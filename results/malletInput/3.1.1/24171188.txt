Prioritize / Ignore CSS rules when working with external css files (kendo ui and  )       I understand that because the kendo file has more specific selectors, it'll take those rules. I would like to just completely ignore rules for .km-button (which is added by using data-role="button" on my button),  so it uses  's rules instead of kendo's .    I could remove the class name dynamically using jQuery, but i'm wondering if it can be done some other way.    Thanks
