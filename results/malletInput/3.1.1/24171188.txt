prioritize / ignore css rules when working with external css files (kendo ui and  )    link rel="stylesheet" href=" "   link href="//maxcdn. cdn.com/ /3.1.1/css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet" /       can't modify those css files. not that i would want to anyway if they were local files.      button type="submit" data-role="button" class="button-right btn-success km-widget km-button"  span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-sign km-text"  /span  nbsp;ok /button   kendo.mobile.all.min.css:9 .km-flat .km-button {   ... }   .min.css:7 .btn-success{   ... }      i understand that because the kendo file has more specific selectors, it'll take those rules. i would like to just completely ignore rules for .km-button (which is added by using data-role="button" on my button),  so it uses  's rules instead of kendo's .    i could remove the class name dynamically using jquery, but i'm wondering if it can be done some other way.    thanks
