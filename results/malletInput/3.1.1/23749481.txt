Hyperlinks not working in IE8 with Twitter Bootstrap  I've looked all over the place for an fix for this but I can't seem to find it!    I've made my own old browser alert using Twitter Bootstrap's alert class with a black overlay on the content under the alert, it looks great, but I want a hyperlink in the alert that takes the user off to     where they can then update their browser. But the hyperlink doesn't do anything in IE - it works in everything else (even IE7!) but in IE8 it just shows up blue and isn't clickable.    I've made a JSFiddle with conditional comments in it so you can see what I'm doing:                 Any help will be MUCH appreciated!     UPDATE:  Turns out it was just my fault for using an online browser simulator! Thank you @joshhunt for your comment regarding this - I sent the link to my friend who has a windows computer and they confirmed it was working, it was actually Browserstack that wasn't working right. I tried taking everything out -   styling, black div (thanks @OJay) and it still didn't work, so I figured it couldn't have been my code. Time to invest in an old Windows laptop for testing! :)
