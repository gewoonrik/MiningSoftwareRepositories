hyperlinks not working in ie8 with      i've looked all over the place for an fix for this but i can't seem to find it!    i've made my own old browser alert using    's alert class with a black overlay on the content under the alert, it looks great, but i want a hyperlink in the alert that takes the user off to     where they can then update their browser. but the hyperlink doesn't do anything in ie - it works in everything else (even ie7!) but in ie8 it just shows up blue and isn't clickable.    i've made a jsfiddle with conditional comments in it so you can see what i'm doing:                 any help will be much appreciated!     update:  turns out it was just my fault for using an online browser simulator! thank you @joshhunt for your comment regarding this - i sent the link to my friend who has a windows computer and they confirmed it was working, it was actually browserstack that wasn't working right. i tried taking everything out -   styling, black div (thanks @ojay) and it still didn't work, so i figured it couldn't have been my code. time to invest in an old windows laptop for testing! :)
