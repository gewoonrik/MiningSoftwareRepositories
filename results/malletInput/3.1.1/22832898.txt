Bootstrap 3 - Expand element over another without ruining layout  I am currently developing a project with  Bootstrap (3.1.1)  and the client wants some elements to be able to expand vertically over other elements.    Here is some example code of the layout:         Here is a visual guide how the element mechanics should work:         Any element/product should be able to expand. Is there any way to achieve this with Bootstrap, if not, is there any way at all.    Thanks for any help, in advance.
