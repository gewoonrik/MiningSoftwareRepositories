Bootstrap glyphicons without changing fonts  I am using Bootstraps glyphicons, including them like this:         Before I loaded the glyphicons CSS file my fonts were fine. I did not set the font, instead using whatever Bootstrap or jQuery sets the font by default.    Now I have included that glyphicon CSS file, my fonts have changed. Can I utilize the glyphicons whilst ignoring the fonts?
