Angular js Bootstrap Date binding  I am new to AngularJs and Bootstrap. I am having trouble with date  binding. My JSON has a date in YYYY-MM-DD format, but it is not binding with the Bootstrap date control.     Is it not possible with out directives or any other UI library (like angular strap or UI etc)    I have created plunker, please let me know if I have made some mistakes           HTML         Note : I prefer to have simple solution, as I am new to Java Script and angular JS (Basically a java guy)    Any help is appreciated.
