How to set the same width for each component in navbar in Bootstrap?  I use Bootstrap 3.1.1 and want to use navbar on the top, using   on the nav, but it looks like navbar doesn't have such a justification method by browsing through  the official documentation page . Also, I would like to position them in whatever looks I feed is good. How can I set an arbitrary number to those elements?
