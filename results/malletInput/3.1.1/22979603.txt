how to set the same width for each component in navbar in  ?  i use   3.1.1 and want to use navbar on the top, using   nav class="navbar navbar-default" role="navigation"  . i can put the navbar and its internal elements properly, but since i have only 3 or 4 elements on the navbar, the right portion of the navbar looks forlorn. so i prefer to use the whole space of the navbar with 3 or 4 elements. is it feasible to set the element in such a way?    i first want to start it with something like  .nav-justified  on the nav, but it looks like navbar doesn't have such a justification method by browsing through  the official documentation page . also, i would like to position them in whatever looks i feed is good. how can i set an arbitrary number to those elements?
