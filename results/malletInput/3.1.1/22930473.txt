How to scroll   modal on windows phone  I've got a simple modal instance created by angularJS (v1.2.14) with the latest version of    (v3.1.1)    The modal won't scroll on my windows phone, instead the whole page scrolls and the modal is clipped to the window size (see screenshot below).    It works fine of course on my desktop in chrome   IE. Haven't tested it on iOS and Android but I guess it works fine.    I added   to  .css but it doesn't make any difference.     EDIT : It appears to be the same issue as this:    /issues/11153
