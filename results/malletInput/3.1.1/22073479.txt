What is the latest jQuery version to work with IE8?  I'm working on a Bootstrap 3 site and I was having some issues with the jQuery version that I was using (1.9.1). I upgraded to 2.1.0 and my issues are gone, however, this breaks IE8 compatibility since 2.1.0 doesn't support IE8 anymore and jQuery seizes to work in this browser.    I can't use 1.1.0 because Bootstrap supports  1.9.0 or higher  (also I'll have my issues back).     So the question is: Which is the highest version of jQuery that works with IE8?    The  jQuery Browser Support Page  only lists 1.11.0 and 1.9.1 so that's not helping.
