  move navbar below other divs on large screens  i am building a responsive page using   3.1.1 and i would like to move the navbar so that it is below some other divs when viewed on non-smartphone screens. see the image below for an example.         i've attempted to do this using the   pull/push classes (see code) but i can't seem to get the combination right. it is displaying as i intend for smartphone, but not larger devices.            html
