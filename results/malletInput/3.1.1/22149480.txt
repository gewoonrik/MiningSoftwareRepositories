Bootstrap move navbar below other divs on large screens  I am building a responsive page using   3.1.1 and I would like to move the navbar so that it is below some other divs when viewed on non-smartphone screens. See the image below for an example.         I've attempted to do this using the   pull/push classes (see code) but I can't seem to get the combination right. It is displaying as I intend for smartphone, but not larger devices.            HTML
