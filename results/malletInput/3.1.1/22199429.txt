Bootstrap grid for printing  I would like to design a report page with a different layout for printing to mobile. I am using   v3. It seems the grid can't differentiate between the two as the breakpoint for printing is the same as the breakpoint for mobile (xs)    For example: In the below test html my printed page (or print preview) shows the xs6 columns side by side but the sm6 columns stacked. There isn't a breakpoint between xs and sm.    Surely my printed page is wider than my mobile viewport so shouldn't it use the sm layout?    Am I doing something wrong or is this the way it is? Is there a defined viewport width for printing?
