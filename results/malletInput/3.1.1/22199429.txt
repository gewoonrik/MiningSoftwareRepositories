  grid for printing  i would like to design a report page with a different layout for printing to mobile. i am using   v3. it seems the grid can't differentiate between the two as the breakpoint for printing is the same as the breakpoint for mobile (xs)    for example: in the below test html my printed page (or print preview) shows the xs6 columns side by side but the sm6 columns stacked. there isn't a breakpoint between xs and sm.    surely my printed page is wider than my mobile viewport so shouldn't it use the sm layout?    am i doing something wrong or is this the way it is? is there a defined viewport width for printing?      !doctype html   html lang="en"   head       meta charset="utf-8"       title test /title       link rel="stylesheet" href="  cdn.com/ /3.1.1/css/ .min.css"   /head   body       div class="container"           div class="row"               div class="col-xs-6"              xs6              /div               div class="col-xs-6"              xs6              /div           /div           div class="row"               div class="col-sm-6"              sm6              /div               div class="col-sm-6"              sm6              /div           /div              /div   /body   /html
