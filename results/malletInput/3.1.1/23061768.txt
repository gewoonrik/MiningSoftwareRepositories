What is the "//= require  /affix" notation for? Is there any grunt tool that uses it?  Lately I switched from      I understand this is to include just one file ( .js) which tells us to require (import) the partials from   directory. However, this is for sure not part of native Javascript, and I couldn't find on google what is it.    Can anyone enlighten me and tell what piece of software should understand this notation and is reponsible for building/getting the partials code? Or is this just a simple comment (if it is.. why on earth create a seperate file for this?)?    EDIT: I use grunt to build my assets. Is there any grunt tool that uses this notation or do I simply ignore it and reference partials in my layout?
