what is the "//= require  /affix" notation for? is there any grunt tool that uses it?  lately i switched from   -sass  repository to   -sass-official  and i noticed something unfamiliar in the   .js  file, namely:     //= require  /affix //= require  /alert //= require  /button //= require  /carousel //= require  /collapse //= require  /dropdown //= require  /tab //= require  /transition //= require  /scrollspy //= require  /modal //= require  /tooltip //= require  /popover      i understand this is to include just one file ( .js) which tells us to require (import) the partials from   directory. however, this is for sure not part of native javascript, and i couldn't find on google what is it.    can anyone enlighten me and tell what piece of software should understand this notation and is reponsible for building/getting the partials code? or is this just a simple comment (if it is.. why on earth create a seperate file for this?)?    edit: i use grunt to build my assets. is there any grunt tool that uses this notation or do i simply ignore it and reference partials in my layout?
