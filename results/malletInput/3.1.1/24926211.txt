why i can't link the css file even when i run code from wiki page for  ?  i came across a problem when i tested the example code on wiki page of    .          as you can see:      link href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.1.1/css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet"       the link doesn't have  http:  or  https: . someone told me it meant this link could be applied by both these two protocols. however, my testing results showed that it doesn't work!   only when i add the  http:  then it works!      so i am confused now. does it mean the usage in the wiki page for   is wrong? or am i getting something wrong?
