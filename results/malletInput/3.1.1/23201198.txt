responsively sizing a sprite  what i'm using:   3.1.1, jquery 1.11    what i'm trying to do: use a sprite for various category icons and position it via css.    on xs devices (phones) i want to keep 3 of these on each row, as i am on small medium   large devices.     however, the size of each icon is 200x200. and i'm not sure how to responsively size a sprite image like this. if i change #category-icons a.hand-tools width   height, it only shows a small section of the sprite instead of sizing the sprite.    the sprite can be found at:        any ideas, guys? should i use 2 different sprites, and use the css below in media queries to use a different sprite for tablets   phones? i'm not sure at all.    looking for the easiest solution that works, of course.    js fiddle at:           div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-4"       a href="/hand-tools/c/p01/" title="hand tools" class="hand-tools" target="_blank" hand tools /a   /div   #category-icons a {     background: url(/images/art/mobile-category-icons.png) no-repeat;     margin-right: 11px;     text-indent: -9999px;     overflow: hidden;     display: inline-block;     margin-bottom: 5px;     -moz-transition: all .2s ease;     -webkit-transition: all .2s ease;     -o-transition: all .2s ease; }  #category-icons a.hand-tools {     background-position: -30px -30px;     height: 200px;     width: 200px;     margin-top: 32px; }
