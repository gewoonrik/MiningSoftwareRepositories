responsively sizing a sprite  what i'm using:   3.1.1, jquery 1.11    what i'm trying to do: use a sprite for various category icons and position it via css.    on xs devices (phones) i want to keep 3 of these on each row, as i am on small medium   large devices.     however, the size of each icon is 200x200. and i'm not sure how to responsively size a sprite image like this. if i change #category-icons a.hand-tools width   height, it only shows a small section of the sprite instead of sizing the sprite.    the sprite can be found at:        any ideas, guys? should i use 2 different sprites, and use the css below in media queries to use a different sprite for tablets   phones? i'm not sure at all.    looking for the easiest solution that works, of course.    js fiddle at:
