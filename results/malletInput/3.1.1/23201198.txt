Responsively sizing a sprite  What I'm using: Bootstrap 3.1.1, jQuery 1.11    What I'm trying to do: Use a sprite for various category icons and position it via CSS.    On xs devices (phones) I want to keep 3 of these on each row, as I am on small medium   large devices.     However, the size of each icon is 200x200. And I'm not sure how to responsively size a sprite image like this. If I change #category-icons a.hand-tools width   height, it only shows a small section of the sprite instead of sizing the sprite.    The sprite can be found at:        Any ideas, guys? Should I use 2 different sprites, and use the CSS below in media queries to use a different sprite for tablets   phones? I'm not sure at all.    Looking for the easiest solution that works, of course.    JS Fiddle at:
