Bootstrap 3.1.1: I can't import all the   .js files, how is "= require" supposed to work?  I am using the latest Bootstrap v3.1.1 Sass.    Within the .zip file, I get  lib, tasks, templates, test and vendor.    I ignored everything and only use the vendor > assets folder. The assets folder has all the fonts, stylesheets and javascripts I need.    I have gotten the file structure setup properly.  However when I am trying to import .js files from the javascript folder, I am having a bit of a problem.    Unlike the  .scss file that comes along. I can just uncomment the _.scss file that I need and it will work.    Within the  .js file, it contains some syntax that I haven't seen before. After a bit of Google, it says 'require' is a nodejs syntax.         I uncommented a few and try to see if they work. However it fails. the .js file I got back is exactly like the above screenshot. It doesn't concatenate modal.js, tooltip.js and popover.js. I did abit of Google, it says I need to have RequireJs?
