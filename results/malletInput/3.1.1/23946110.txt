  3.1.1: i can't import all the   .js files, how is "= require" supposed to work?  i am using the latest   v3.1.1 sass.    within the .zip file, i get  lib, tasks, templates, test and vendor.    i ignored everything and only use the vendor > assets folder. the assets folder has all the fonts, stylesheets and javascripts i need.    i have gotten the file structure setup properly.  however when i am trying to import .js files from the javascript folder, i am having a bit of a problem.    unlike the  .scss file that comes along. i can just uncomment the _.scss file that i need and it will work.    within the  .js file, it contains some syntax that i haven't seen before. after a bit of google, it says 'require' is a nodejs syntax.         i uncommented a few and try to see if they work. however it fails. the .js file i got back is exactly like the above screenshot. it doesn't concatenate modal.js, tooltip.js and popover.js. i did abit of google, it says i need to have requirejs?
