Bootstrap datetimepicker  I managed to mix up my repositories due to unfamiliarity to github, and now I can't get this to run anymore at all. I have tried everything and have only managed to break it more. The last thing I did which broke it completely was try to use the quick start css / javascript links on my application.html.erb          now when you click the calendar icon nothing shows up, before you could click the dates and it would appear in the box but the blue surrounding the date when you click it wouldn't.     events.js.coffee         So my error is that it isn't working properly. What I mean by that is if you click the year portion on top it freaks out and displays something like this        2014 JANFEBMARAPRMAYJUNJUL  etc etc.    also the buttons when you click them are having a black bar through them and the dates when you click them don't turn blue    I would really appreciate any help you experts could give me. Thanks
