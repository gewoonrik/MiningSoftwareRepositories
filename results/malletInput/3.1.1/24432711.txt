selectize not working inside   panel  i'm using selectize.js 0.10.1 with   3.0.1 in my project. when i have selectize combobox outside the collapsible   panel, everything works great as you can see in the picture.      working code:         i got it to work when i use   2.3.2 and selectize.js 0.9 in this  fiddle , but i can't get it to work with   3.1.1 and selectize.js 0.9 in this  fiddle . i even tried selectize 0.10.1, but no luck.    can this be solved or is it some kind of version problem? i need to use   3.0+ in my project.
