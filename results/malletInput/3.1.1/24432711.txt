Selectize not working inside Bootstrap panel  I'm using selectize.js 0.10.1 with Bootstrap 3.0.1 in my project. When I have selectize combobox outside the collapsible Bootstrap panel, everything works great as you can see in the picture.      Working code:         I got it to work when I use Bootstrap 2.3.2 and selectize.js 0.9 in this  fiddle , but I can't get it to work with Bootstrap 3.1.1 and selectize.js 0.9 in this  fiddle . I even tried selectize 0.10.1, but no luck.    Can this be solved or is it some kind of version problem? I need to use Bootstrap 3.0+ in my project.
