undefined mixin 'formfieldstate'  i use  -sass and it was running perfect, until i recently tried to change a few parameters in my css, and i now suddenly get and error message "undefined mixin 'formfieldstate'."    i use it in the following:     .fieldwitherrors {   // pulled from div.clearfix.error   @include formfieldstate(#b94a48, #ee5f5b, lighten(#ee5f5b, 30%)); }      i read another question, here, with the same problem, but the solution that seemed to be the right one doesn't work for me.    my gemfile reads :     gem 'sass-rails',   '3.2.6' gem ' -sass', '~  3.1.1'      i don't get why formfieldstate is not supported anymore, since it worked perfect before and i changed nothing, except unrelated parameters in the css...    when i neutralize the ..fieldwitherrors {...} it works again, but then all my screens are de-structured and i have no idea what i should do to fix them all.    thanks for your help.
