how many   links do i need to use at the top of my index.html file to use a template  i am trying to use a bootswatch   template that you can find here:    cdn.com/#bootswatch_tab  (the template is amelia).     do i only add this to my index.html document:      link href="//maxcdn. cdn.com/bootswatch/3.1.1/amelia/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet"       or do i need to add these two as well to make it work:      link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/ .css"   link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css"       i figured i just needed the first piece of code but i need it to connect to my style.css document.
