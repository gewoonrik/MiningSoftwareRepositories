Bootstrap 3.1.1 Navbar different layout when collapsed  I am trying to share the navbar across all devices, but I want it to format differently on small screens than on large.  I am new to Bootstrap so this might be obvious, but I am having trouble getting the menu right with a single set of code and not trying to do it with different rows and col-* settings.     Bootply Sample  I want two things actually.  I would like the win and loss to be on the same line (which is close without the navbar-right) except they are not even in vertical position. EDIT: I am able to correct this when removing navbar-right etc..., but do not get the navbar-right when the menu is condensed.    Secondly, I wanted the navbar-right, so when on a small display, all the badges align on the right hand side of the menu.    Is there a way to keep the menu smaller as well, so on a tablet it is not the whole width of the screen while on a phone it might be?    When the navbar normally draws, I want the badges beside the labels to keep the menu items smaller/closer together.  Only on the pull down menu do I want them to go to the right.      Do I need to create two copies of the navigation to achieve this?
