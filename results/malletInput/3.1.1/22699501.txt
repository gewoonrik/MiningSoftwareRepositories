  3.1.1 navbar different layout when collapsed  i am trying to share the navbar across all devices, but i want it to format differently on small screens than on large.  i am new to   so this might be obvious, but i am having trouble getting the menu right with a single set of code and not trying to do it with different rows and col-* settings.     bootply sample  i want two things actually.  i would like the win and loss to be on the same line (which is close without the navbar-right) except they are not even in vertical position. edit: i am able to correct this when removing navbar-right etc..., but do not get the navbar-right when the menu is condensed.    secondly, i wanted the navbar-right, so when on a small display, all the badges align on the right hand side of the menu.    is there a way to keep the menu smaller as well, so on a tablet it is not the whole width of the screen while on a phone it might be?    when the navbar normally draws, i want the badges beside the labels to keep the menu items smaller/closer together.  only on the pull down menu do i want them to go to the right.      do i need to create two copies of the navigation to achieve this?
