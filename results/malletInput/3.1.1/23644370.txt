  image sizing and centering  i am new to   and i am having an issue trying to position an image on the page.  i am trying to use   grid to position the image in the center of the page.  i am familiar with html5 and  i know there are other ways of centering the image ;however,i was wondering if this can be done using  's grid system.  the reason for this example, is that i have other image position things i would like to use   for.      when i run the example below on a windows 8 desktop or ipad the image is extremely small(i.e. almost like an icon) and resides in the upper left corner; however, when i run this on my nexus 5 the image is sized correctly and is centered. i have included some sample html code of what i am using.    again, i am some what new to   so it could be something simple.  any input or advice is greatly appreciated    thanks in advance for your help
