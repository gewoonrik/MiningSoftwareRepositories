  image sizing and centering  i am new to   and i am having an issue trying to position an image on the page.  i am trying to use   grid to position the image in the center of the page.  i am familiar with html5 and  i know there are other ways of centering the image ;however,i was wondering if this can be done using  's grid system.  the reason for this example, is that i have other image position things i would like to use   for.      when i run the example below on a windows 8 desktop or ipad the image is extremely small(i.e. almost like an icon) and resides in the upper left corner; however, when i run this on my nexus 5 the image is sized correctly and is centered. i have included some sample html code of what i am using.    again, i am some what new to   so it could be something simple.  any input or advice is greatly appreciated    thanks in advance for your help      !doctype html       html lang="en"      head      meta charset="utf-8"      title autoroute login /title      meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,   height=device-height,initial-scale=1.0"   link rel="stylesheet" href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /        3.1.1/css/ .min.css"   link rel="stylesheet" href="http:// .github.com/ /assets/          css/ -responsive.css"   style    @media (min-width:@screen-sm-min){     #main-image{         height: 200px;       width:200px;         }           }    @media (min-width: @screen-md-min){     #main-image{         height: 350px;          width: 350px;         }   }   /style    /head     body      div class="container"        div class="row"        div class="col-sm-2 col-md-2"/        div id="main-image" class="col-sm-8 col-md-8"          img src="img/ar-main-image.jpg" alt="autoroute main image"          class="img-responsive center-block"/        /div        div class="col-sm-2 col-md-2"/        /div         /div       script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/            jquery.min.js"      /script   script src="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.1.1/js/            .min.js"  /script    /body   /html
