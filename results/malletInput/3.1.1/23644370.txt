Bootstrap Image Sizing and Centering  I am new to   and I am having an issue trying to position an Image on the page.  I am trying to use   grid to position the image in the center of the page.  I am familiar with html5 and  I know there are other ways of centering the image ;however,I was wondering if this can be done using  's grid system.  The reason for this example, is that I have other image position things I would like to use   for.      When I run the example below on a Windows 8 desktop or iPad the image is extremely small(i.e. almost like an icon) and resides in the upper left corner; however, when I run this on my Nexus 5 the image is sized correctly and is centered. I have included some sample html code of what I am using.    Again, I am some what new to   so it could be something simple.  Any input or advice is greatly appreciated    Thanks in advance for your help
