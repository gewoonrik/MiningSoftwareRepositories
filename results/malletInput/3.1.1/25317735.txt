git commit creates assets and temporary files for some reason  whenever i run  git commit -m "blah" , my apps are creating a bunch of random files, for some reason. this is causing a problem because it is taking up lots of space on my server and my  git push heroku master  command will timeout.     what is happening? below is the output from my last commit on an almost blank app. the only things i have on the app are these gems:     source '  bundle edge rails instead: gem 'rails', github: 'rails/rails' gem 'rails', '4.1.1'  gem ' -sass', '~  3.1.1'   group :development do     gem 'sqlite3'  end  group :production do   gem 'pg'   gem 'rails_12factor' end  # use sqlite3 as the database for active record gem 'sqlite3' # use scss for stylesheets gem 'sass-rails', '~  4.0.3' # use uglifier as compressor for javascript assets gem 'uglifier', ' = 1.3.0' # use coffeescript for .js.coffee assets and views gem 'coffee-rails', '~  4.0.0' # see   for more supported runtimes # gem 'therubyracer',  platforms: :ruby  # use jquery as the javascript library gem 'jquery-rails' # turbolinks makes following links in your web application faster. read more:   'turbolinks' # build json apis with ease. read more:   'jbuilder', '~  2.0' # bundle exec rake doc:rails generates the api under doc/api. gem 'sdoc', '~  0.4.0',          group: :doc  # use activemodel has_secure_password # gem 'bcrypt', '~  3.1.7'  # use unicorn as the app server # gem 'unicorn'  # use capistrano for deployment # gem 'capistrano-rails', group: :development  # use debugger # gem 'debugger', group: [:development, :test]  # windows does not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem gem 'tzinfo-data', platforms: [:mingw, :mswin]      and a simple   carousel on the home page. however all these other files get
