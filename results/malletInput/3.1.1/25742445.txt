angularjs 1.3 - datepicker initial format is incorrect  i started using angularjs 1.3 yesterday and one problem i have found is that the initial date in the datepicker is not in the defined format. the format of the date is correct  after  choosing a date.    the initial format is correct with angularjs 1.2.10 as can be seen in the example by commenting out the script tag.    how can i set the initial format to be correct?     plunker example     html
