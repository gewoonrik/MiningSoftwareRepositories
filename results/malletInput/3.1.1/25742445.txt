AngularJS 1.3 - Datepicker initial format is incorrect  I started using AngularJS 1.3 yesterday and one problem I have found is that the initial date in the Datepicker is not in the defined format. The format of the date is correct  after  choosing a date.    The initial format is correct with AngularJS 1.2.10 as can be seen in the example by commenting out the script tag.    How can I set the initial format to be correct?     Plunker example     HTML
