decreasing the height   navbar size without using less?  i am trying to decrease the height of the   3.1.1's navbar without using the less version of it. i have tried several ways of doing this by reading around on different sites, and none of them are decreasing the css's   respectfully and nothing has worked yet.    do i need to call a different css class then the ones i have tried, or do i need to call two of the ones i have already tried to get the effect needed?
