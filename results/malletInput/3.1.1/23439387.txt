Decreasing the height   navbar size without using less?  I am trying to decrease the height of the Bootstrap 3.1.1's navbar without using the less version of it. I have tried several ways of doing this by reading around on different sites, and none of them are decreasing the CSS's   respectfully and nothing has worked yet.    Do I need to call a different CSS Class then the ones I have tried, or do I need to call two of the ones I have already tried to get the effect needed?
