decreasing the height   navbar size without using less?  i am trying to decrease the height of the   3.1.1's navbar without using the less version of it. i have tried several ways of doing this by reading around on different sites, and none of them are decreasing the css's  .navbar  height.    i have managed to fix the padding on the  .navbar-nav   li   a .     my html:         div class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top" role="navigation"        div class="container"           div class="navbar-header"              button type="button" class="navbar-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse"                 span class="sr-only" toggle /span                 span class="icon-bar"  /span                 span class="icon-bar"  /span                 span class="icon-bar"  /span              /button              a class="navbar-brand" href="/" quadcms /a           /div           div class="collapse navbar-collapse"              ul class="nav navbar-nav"                 li class="active"  a href="/" home /a  /li                 li  a href="/support/" help /a  /li               /ul            /div         /div      /div       my css which overrides the   to try to fix the navbar.     .navbar {    height: 25px !important;    }  .navbar-nav   li   a {     padding-top: 5px !important;    padding-bottom: 5px !important;    }      my main issue is with the actual height of the navbar, not the padding now. the padding of the navigation links are fixed and working at the small size. i have also tried changing the  .navbar  to  .navbar-nav , and  .navbar-fixed-top  respectfully and nothing has worked yet.    do i need to call a different css class then the ones i have tried, or do i need to call two of the ones i have already tried to get the effect needed?
