Bootstrap 3.1.1 modal pops vertical scroll offset to 0  I have been working with   3.1.1, attempting to show a modal dialog over my content but currently the behaviour that exists is when   executes Modal.show() ( along the call stack of $("#player-background").modal({'show':true}); ), the page jumps back to the top when the modal is shown.    When the modal is shown it triggers the 'show.bs.modal' event, resulting in the vertical page offset popping to 0. I have isolated the issue down to when   appends the css class modal-open, which disables scrolling the page.    I have attempted to set the body to have a negative margin-top value equal in magnitude to the current scroll offset, but this results in a fully blank page.    My styles for the body and html elements are as follows:         I have also attempt to remove the height: 100% from the body and html tags but then the body remains scrollable, which is not the intended behaviour. Any help with this issue would be greatly appreciated.
