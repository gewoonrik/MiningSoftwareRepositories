resizing   3.1.1 navbar  i had a quick question regarding     navbars.  i'm attempting to change the width of my navbar to only occupy 80% of the page width and centered on the page.    i've tried setting the width of .navbar, .nav, .navbar-collapse to 80%, all either doing nothing or shrinking the navbar way too much.    link to the code:        thanks for your help.
