Resizing Bootstrap 3.1.1 Navbar  I had a quick question regarding twitter   navbars.  I'm attempting to change the width of my navbar to only occupy 80% of the page width and centered on the page.    I've tried setting the width of .navbar, .nav, .navbar-collapse to 80%, all either doing nothing or shrinking the navbar way too much.    Link to the code:        Thanks for your help.
