  3.1.1 css not working  here's an interesting problem.    i've started going through angularjs training on pluralsight. i'm still pretty much at the beginning, so it's still just basics, creating a controller, passing the data from $scope to view and stuff like that. one problem that i've ran into is that   css is not working. the path to the stylesheet is all good, when i open up the f12 in chrome, it shows that the css and other scripts are loaded properly, but classes won't apply to certain elements (span4, navbar, and so forth). actually, none of the style rules apply.    here's the markup:         btw, i'm using visual studio for this, i've even tried to give a full path to the css, but it's not working. i've tried to create the same page in other text editors, i've tried to remove any reference to angular, but with no luck.
