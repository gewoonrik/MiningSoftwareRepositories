    glyphicon shows 'greater than' sign instead of the glyphicon  i have the following simple bit of code:         instead of seeing the question mark sign, it comes up with a greater than sign (>). i tried changing it to other glyphicons, such as the info sign, and that became the "less than, or equal to" sign.     has anyone hit this issue before? any hints would be appreciated.      version: 3.1.1
