Bootstrap 3.1.1: how to use its RTL?  Today, I downloaded Bootstrap  3.1.1  at         I notice that under its directory    /dist/css    I see the following file:     -rtl.css    I assume that this file is for RTL.     However, in this blog:    .com/ , I see the following:     While we originally wanted v3.1 to include RTL support, we decided to hold back on that for some potentially beneficial unreleased tooling. We'll share more on that when we know more, but suffice to say it's been bumped to * v3.2 . *    Am I supposed to use this  -rtl.css in  3.1.1  for a RTL website? What is its development status? I am unable to see any javascript files for RTL in the download (or use the same  .js for both LTR and RTL websites?).    I am  confused. Is there any tutorial about how to use it? I googled and failed to find any tutorial about it.    Thanks for any info!
