  3 tables don't work properly with meteor    tables don't display like they are supposed to when i use them with meteor.   table-striped  doesn't work and the padding is off.    i've tried using the  -3 package as well as a base meteor app with the css linked to a cdn.     does anyone know what is going on?         here is the meteor html      head     title test /title     link href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.1.1/css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet"   /head    body    {{  hello}}  /body    template name="hello"       div class="container"       h1 hello world! /h1       p default /p       table class="table"       tr           td test 1 /td           td test 2 /td       /tr         tr           td test 1 /td           td test 2 /td       /tr         tr           td test 1 /td           td test 2 /td       /tr     /table        p table-striped /p       table class="table table-striped"       tr           td test 1 /td           td test 2 /td       /tr         tr           td test 1 /td           td test 2 /td       /tr         tr           td test 1 /td           td test 2 /td       /tr     /table       p table-bordered /p        table class="table table-bordered"       tr           td test 1 /td           td test 2 /td       /tr         tr           td test 1 /td           td test 2 /td       /tr         tr           td test 1 /td           td test 2 /td       /tr     /table     /div   /template
