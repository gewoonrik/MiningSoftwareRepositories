jquery.fileupload.js issue with     3.1.1  i am using the jquery.fileupload.js in my web application and have based my code on an example from this tutorial.         it works well with   -2.3.1\ .css  but i have found that when i try and replace that version with   -3.1.1-dist\ .css  it does not work.    so what i have done so far as a work around is to have only the file upload section of the page in an iframe with that iframe having the 2.3.1 css applied to it. this is something which i would rather not do.    is jquery.fileupload.js compatible with  -3.1.1? if it is compatible does anyone know what might be going wrong?    also if it is not compatible from a css perspective can i do something like apply the 2.3.1 css to a certain part of the page? i would rather that then use an iframe as a work around.    thanks
