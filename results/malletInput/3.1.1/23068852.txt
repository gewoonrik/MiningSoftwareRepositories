Bootstrap carousel buttons not aligning veritcally on smaller screens  I am using  Twitter Bootstrap 3.1.1 .    Source code:        I am adding a  carousel  to the top of my website and I have chosen to not use the indicator dots on each slide. (I omitted the   element)    The problem that I am running into is that the next and previous buttons are not centered vertically on smaller screens.    Here's how it looks at full size:      And here's how it looks when the screen size is smaller:      How can I get the next and previous buttons/icons to align vertically on smaller screens? The buttons are moving further south the smaller the screen gets.
