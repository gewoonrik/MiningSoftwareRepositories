  carousel buttons not aligning veritcally on smaller screens  i am using      3.1.1 .    source code:        i am adding a  carousel  to the top of my website and i have chosen to not use the indicator dots on each slide. (i omitted the   ol class="carousel-indicators"   element)    the problem that i am running into is that the next and previous buttons are not centered vertically on smaller screens.    here's how it looks at full size:      and here's how it looks when the screen size is smaller:      how can i get the next and previous buttons/icons to align vertically on smaller screens? the buttons are moving further south the smaller the screen gets.
