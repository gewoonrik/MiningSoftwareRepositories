visual studio asp.net mvc not loading local  .css  i installed   using nuget package manager and the css files are now in my /content/ folder. however, when trying to reference them using:      link rel="stylesheet"  href="âˆ¼/content/ .min.css" /       it doesn't work. but when referencing them using a cdn like:      link rel="stylesheet" href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.1.1/css/ .min.css"       it does work. i can't seem to figure out what is wrong as i have never had this problem before. i'm using an empty template with mvc.    edit: after some playing around, i found that it was failing to load /%e2%88%bc/content/ .css but after removing the tilda (~) it works fine. anybody got any ideas?
