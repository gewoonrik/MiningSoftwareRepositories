visual studio asp.net mvc not loading local  .css  i installed   using nuget package manager and the css files are now in my /content/ folder. however, when trying to reference them using:         it does work. i can't seem to figure out what is wrong as i have never had this problem before. i'm using an empty template with mvc.    edit: after some playing around, i found that it was failing to load /%e2%88%bc/content/ .css but after removing the tilda (~) it works fine. anybody got any ideas?
