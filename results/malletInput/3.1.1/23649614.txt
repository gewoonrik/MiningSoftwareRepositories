Visual Studio ASP.NET MVC Not Loading Local  .css  I installed   using nuget package manager and the css files are now in my /Content/ folder. However, when trying to reference them using:         It does work. I can't seem to figure out what is wrong as I have never had this problem before. I'm using an Empty template with MVC.    EDIT: After some playing around, I found that it was failing to load /%E2%88%BC/Content/ .css but after removing the tilda (~) it works fine. Anybody got any ideas?
