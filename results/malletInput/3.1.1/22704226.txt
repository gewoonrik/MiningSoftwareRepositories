Google Translate conflicts with Twitter Bootstrap v3.1.1 sticky footer  On my site I'm using Bootstrap v3.1.1 and I have a sticky footer, using the base code and styling that can be found here -->    .com/examples/sticky-footer/     Everything works fine until I enable the Google Translate plugin (translate.google.com/translate_tools) ... here is sample Google Translate plugin code:         After adding the Google Translate button the footer undocks from sticking at the bottom and instead floats in the same spot in the middle of the page.     Any suggestions on how I could correct this problem ... I'd like to have the sticky footer and also the Google translate plugin on my pages if possible.     Thanks, Neil
