apply style just a few elements  i am working on a mvc project where i need a particular view to apply the   css style on two elements: a table and a multiselect, the css files in question are:        link href="~/content/themes/ / -3.1.1.min.css" rel="stylesheet" /     link href="~/content/themes/ / -multiselect.css" rel="stylesheet" /       the problem is that by including those two lines in the code, it completely changes the style of the whole page. so i want to know if there is a way to apply only to those two elements these styles.    first thing i did was to create a single file to unify these two files into one single being ( according to this link ):      link href="~/content/themes/ /all- .min.css" rel="stylesheet" /       these are the items to which to apply.      select id="chkrecids" multiple="multiple" /    table id="table_odc" class="table table-striped table-bordered table-hover"  ...  /table       thank you very much, if you need more information let me know.
