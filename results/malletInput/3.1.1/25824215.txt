Suddenly   multiselect not workin on drupal site  Few days back nearly (1 week back) i have implemented        multiselect on drupal website. upto yersterday it works      fine on server and local machine. But suddenly today when i click      on dropdown button  that dropdown is not opening.      I have removed all the code and even try with   basic example ,      even that also not working.    What i observe on firebug console when i click on the dropdown button  it is not adding "open" class to the btn-group.
