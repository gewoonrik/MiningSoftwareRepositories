Bootstrap 3.1.1 Affix and Youtube Issue  Is there any reason why Affix spazzes out when there is a youtube embedded on the page? The left sidebar (which is what I'm affixing) doesn't affix when you scroll. In the second screenshot, I hovered over the sidebar to get a couple elements to pop up so you could see it. I removed the youtube video and it worked just fine. I can post more specific information if needed... I just could not find any resources online where this particular issue was brought up.
