  3.1.1 affix and youtube issue  is there any reason why affix spazzes out when there is a youtube embedded on the page? the left sidebar (which is what i'm affixing) doesn't affix when you scroll. in the second screenshot, i hovered over the sidebar to get a couple elements to pop up so you could see it. i removed the youtube video and it worked just fine. i can post more specific information if needed... i just could not find any resources online where this particular issue was brought up.
