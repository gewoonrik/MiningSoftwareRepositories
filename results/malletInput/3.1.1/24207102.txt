Bootstrap justified navbar not evenly spacing menu items on Internet explorer  I'm using twitter   3.1.1 and using the nav-justified class for my main navigation. It works well on all the major browsers except IE11 and below. Firefox, Chrome and Safari are able to evenly space out the li items based on the content but in IE it doesn't. Does anyone know of any quick fixes or point me in the right direction? I'm trying to avoid JS to set the widths and am trying to work out a CSS solution. Has anyone had this issue with the navbar in  ?     Navigation displaying correctly on firefox, chrome, safari           Navigation not evenly spacing out menu items on IE11, IE10, IE9 or IE8          I've put an example of JSFiddle -             On IE the Benefit Cards item has different space between that and gallery and reservations. However on all the other major browsers the spacing between all navigation items is consistent.    thanks
