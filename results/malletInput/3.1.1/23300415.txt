displaying div only on mobile devices  i have a div that i'd like to only load on mobile devices - and mobile browser sizes.    i am using   3.1.1, but using the visible   hidden classes still loads the content in the background even if it's hidden.    so, anyway to do this easily? where i can just paste my html into a section of code and it just works?     edit     i only want to load this entire section of code on mobile devices   mobile browser sizes (if i resize my desktop browser). like i said, i am using   3.1.1, but the code still loads in the background, defeating the point of what i'm trying to do; load lighter content on mobile, load heavier content on desktop.    with the code below, it gets loaded in the background anyways, creating overhead. i need a way to insert that entire section of code into a page only if the user is on a mobile device or their browser is a mobile width.    i want the code itself to only even be included if on mobile device or mobile browser size.    all   does is hide the content from the front-end via display:none; it still gets loaded when someone visits the page. i need to not even load it until needed.
