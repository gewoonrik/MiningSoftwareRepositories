Displaying div only on mobile devices  I have a div that I'd like to only load on mobile devices - and mobile browser sizes.    I am using Bootstrap 3.1.1, but using the visible   hidden classes still loads the content in the background even if it's hidden.    So, anyway to do this easily? Where I can just paste my HTML into a section of code and it just works?     Edit     I only want to load this entire section of code on mobile devices   mobile browser sizes (if I resize my desktop browser). Like I said, I am using Bootstrap 3.1.1, but the code still loads in the background, defeating the point of what I'm trying to do; load lighter content on mobile, load heavier content on desktop.    With the code below, it gets loaded in the background anyways, creating overhead. I need a way to insert that entire section of code into a page only if the user is on a mobile device or their browser is a mobile width.    I want the code itself to only even be included if on mobile device or mobile browser size.    All Bootstrap does is hide the content from the front-end via display:none; it still gets loaded when someone visits the page. I need to not even load it until needed.
