changing the background for   dropdown a on hover  i am using  's dropdown from a navigation div, and i'd like to change the color of the the  sub-menu  links on hover. nothing i'm attempting works, and i can't make sense of it. it's not having any effect even when trying to run things from the chrome console.    i have created a css file where i override the defaults. the background change for normal  a  tags work, but the hover doesn't. why is that? i also tried affecting the  li  and using  !important , but none of that is having any effect.    i'm using   3.1.1. here's my css:     .dropdown-menu   li   a {     color: white; /* this has an effect */ }  .dropdown-menu   li   a:hover {     background-color: red; /* this doesn't... why? */ }      and check out this  jsfiddle  too for a demonstration (for some reason you need to drag the result panel a whole lot to the left before you see the button). any ideas?      edit      note i am trying to change the background color for the links  in  the dropdown, not for the main button which is  myprofile .
