Which version does Meteor's core Bootstrap package use?  The Meteor docs very blithely neglect to tell us what version the  core package of    uses, and for the life of me I cannot find an answer to this seemingly simple question!!!    It  seems  like the core devs are awesome enough to keep it updated to the latest version (I want  !! It's so beautiful!!!!), but the presence of hack-it-yourself packages like  mangasocial / meteor- -3  make me doubt that.    I want to use the core package, I want that reliability, but I also want the latest version. What should I do?
