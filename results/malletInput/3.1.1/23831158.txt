Jquery $ Not defined, but it is       I keep reading the following,    That error can only be caused by one of three things:      Your JavaScript file is not being properly loaded into your page   You have a botched version of jQuery.

You have JavaScript running before the page is fully loaded, and as such, before jQuery is fully loaded.      a. Why wouldn't it be?    b. Its from jQuery's page for CDN    c. No its at the bottom...
