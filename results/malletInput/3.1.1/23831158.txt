jquery $ not defined, but it is    script  $(document).ready(function () { function updatedata(){   $('#ajax').load('./alerts.php', function(){     settimeout(updateimage, 2000);   }); };  updatedata(); });  /script       that above $ is where devtools js console see's the error. on the $(document)    but i am cdn'ing jquery at the bottom of this page.      script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"  /script   script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-migrate-1.2.1.min.js"  /script   script src="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.1.1/js/ .min.js"  /script       i keep reading the following,    that error can only be caused by one of three things:      your javascript file is not being properly loaded into your page   you have a botched version of jquery. this could happen because someone edited the core file, or a plugin may have overwritten the $ variable.   you have javascript running before the page is fully loaded, and as such, before jquery is fully loaded.      a. why wouldn't it be?    b. its from jquery's page for cdn    c. no its at the bottom...
