  tooltip\popover - solving inconsistent placement to the left  I've been working on a project and I've noticed some inconsistency in  's behavior that I would like to solve.     When a popover (or tooltip, whatever, they're basically the same) is nearing the edge of the screen - if it's a right-sided one, when nearing the edge - it will contract so as not to go offscreen (it only works up to a point, but that's usually enough).    This doesn't happen when the placement is to the left.    i.e.:     right placement:     Normal width:         Close to the edge:          left placement:     Normal width:         close to the edge:         These images are from a small  DEMO  I wrote to illustrate the problem.    I've messed around with the source code, so far to no avail. I can't seem to place my finger on what exactly causes this behavior in the first place.    Any ideas?     p.s.     I'm using Bootstrap 3.1.1. The new 3.2 does  not  solve the issue (and I would like to avoid upgrading at this point).        Major Update!     After some digging, I figured out that this has nothing to do with   - it's simple css - it seems that when you position an element absolutely and push it to the sides it will try and stay withing the screen.    I never knew about this behavior, and it happens automatically - but only to the the direction you're pushing - i.e. a div pushed from the left will contract when reaching the right edge of the screen and vice versa.     It just so happens that popovers are only positioned with the   placement. I don't want it.  I want to control where the popover goes, letting it decide automatically is not a solution to the problem, it's merely avoiding it
