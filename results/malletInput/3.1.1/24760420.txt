  tooltip\popover - solving inconsistent placement to the left  i've been working on a project and i've noticed some inconsistency in  's behavior that i would like to solve.     when a popover (or tooltip, whatever, they're basically the same) is nearing the edge of the screen - if it's a right-sided one, when nearing the edge - it will contract so as not to go offscreen (it only works up to a point, but that's usually enough).    this doesn't happen when the placement is to the left.    i.e.:     right placement:     normal width:         close to the edge:          left placement:     normal width:         close to the edge:         these images are from a small  demo  i wrote to illustrate the problem.    i've messed around with the source code, so far to no avail. i can't seem to place my finger on what exactly causes this behavior in the first place.    any ideas?     p.s.     i'm using   3.1.1. the new 3.2 does  not  solve the issue (and i would like to avoid upgrading at this point).        major update!     after some digging, i figured out that this has nothing to do with   - it's simple css - it seems that when you position an element absolutely and push it to the sides it will try and stay withing the screen.    i never knew about this behavior, and it happens automatically - but only to the the direction you're pushing - i.e. a div pushed from the left will contract when reaching the right edge of the screen and vice versa.     it just so happens that popovers are only positioned with the   placement. i don't want it.  i want to control where the popover goes, letting it decide automatically is not a solution to the problem, it's merely avoiding it
