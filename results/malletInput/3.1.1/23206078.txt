Twitter Bootstrap, Nav-Bar and Laravel  I'm doing an application using Laravel and I want to use twitter  .    I'm using Laravel 4.1 and Boottstrap 3.1.1    I want to have a nav-bar so I did this code         But I got this         The nav-bar looks bad, and I don't know what to do to have my nav-bar looking normal.    The css is not working properly, and I don't know why.    Any clues on what the problem might be?
