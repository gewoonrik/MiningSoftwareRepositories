  'fade in' on modal makes modal content iframe and jsp invisible on firefox  i am having some issues with    3.1.1  and the modal. i have been transferring some legacy web code to this for our page: new modal.     problem is, when i add the content- which consists of an iframe with a 3rd party jsp-applet inside of it:     the jsp is never shown on firefox!    if i manually remove the  fade  and  in  class of the modal using firebug the jsp appears. i have looked into it and in our code we added  fade in  to the classes of the modal. removing this removed the  fade  class, but it seems the  in  class is added by the   modal.js around line          71: .addclass('in') .     this surely sounds like a bug in  , my questions are:    can i easily bypass this animation without changing the   specific code?    has anybody else experienced similar issues?
