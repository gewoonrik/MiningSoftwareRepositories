jQuery UI +   + noConflict results in "data is not a function" (tooltip)  I had to fix a conflict between jQuery UI and   because i need both toltip functions.    So this is what I did:    Including:      jquery-1.7.2.min.js   ui stuff     (v3.1.1 minified)   resolve Conflict js   another js which calls   tooltip      This is my fix:         What happens:  The tooltip is shown (well formatted) when the user hovers over a.icon-tooltip but on leaving the elements the error "TypeError: a(...)this.type.data is not a function".     This is the position in the  :          var c=b instanceof this.constructor?b:a(b.currentTarget)this.type.data("bs."+this.type);
