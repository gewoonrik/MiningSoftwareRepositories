stop un-rendered content showing before html5shiv is used  i am using   3.1.1 with the html5shiv script (     ).     all is working great except that my page load takes about 0.5 seconds longer than it should to apply the html5shiv and for about that time, on ie 8, i see the un-ordered and incorrectly rendered content showing through. it effectively creates a "flash".    is there a good trick to only show the page once html5shiv has been applied is there something i am missing (i don't see this problem on other sites that use the html5shiv)?    i have added:         to the very top of my page and the html5shyiv script is as high as it can go without breaking thanks to google analytics putting its inclusion scripts always before the first script tag :)
