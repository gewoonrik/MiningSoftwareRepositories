    3.1.1 navbar-right overflows navbar  i'm experimenting with the carousel example in     3.1.1 and i've fallen at the first hurdle.  i want to add a right-aligned search box to the navigation bar, so i've added the following code (i've included some of the existing code for context):         the inserted code was taken from    's "default navbar" on the components page.  i've inserted it in the equivalent position of the carousel's navbar, changing "navbar-left" to "navbar-right" .  unfortunately, the search box overhangs the right hand side of the navigation bar by about 15-20 pixels (i've also removed the submit button from the above example, but if i put it back in, the submit button overhangs the navigation bar in the same way).  what have i done wrong here?    (edit: included the whole navbar section as requested)
