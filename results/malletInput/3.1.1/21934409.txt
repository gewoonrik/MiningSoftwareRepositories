Twitter Bootstrap 3.1.1 navbar-right overflows navbar  I'm experimenting with the Carousel example in Twitter Bootstrap 3.1.1 and I've fallen at the first hurdle.  I want to add a right-aligned search box to the navigation bar, so I've added the following code (I've included some of the existing code for context):         The inserted code was taken from Twitter Bootstrap's "Default navbar" on the Components page.  I've inserted it in the equivalent position of the Carousel's navbar, changing "navbar-left" to "navbar-right" .  Unfortunately, the search box overhangs the right hand side of the navigation bar by about 15-20 pixels (I've also removed the Submit button from the above example, but if I put it back in, the submit button overhangs the navigation bar in the same way).  What have I done wrong here?    (Edit: included the whole navbar section as requested)
