jqm buttons won't enhance with backbone.js, underscore.js, and    i have an app that is using backbone.js to manage models, views, and collections, underscore.js to handle view templates, and jquery mobile and   for the user interface.  many of my view templates have buttons in them, but when the view is rendered the buttons will not enhance.  everything in the view is enhanced but the buttons.    see the screenshot showing a portion of a form in one of my views:         as you can see, the  select  elements enhance as expected as do  textarea  elements.  i have  text input ,  checkbox ,  radio button ,  date input , and  number input  elements in my form as well that also enhance.  after the view is rendered using it's  render  function i call  view.$el.trigger('create') , which enhances everything within the view to use jqm styles, but not the buttons.    i've tried calling  .button() ,  .trigger('create') , and  .buttonmarkup()  on the button itself, but it has no effect.    i am using jqm v1.3.2, jquery v1.10.2, underscore.js v1.5.2, backbone.js v1.1.0, and   v3.1.1.    any ideas how i can make the buttons enhance to use jqm styles?     update:     here is a simple jsfiddle:         update 2:     i have created another jsfiddle that does not use views.  it is simply html with external resources loaded for jquery, jquery mobile, underscore.js, backbone.js, and  .  here is the link:        i originally had   as the last external resource and the button would not enhance.  then, when i removed jquery mobile and re-added it as the last external resource, the button would enhance.  it looks like it could be as simple as   overriding jquery mobile as both have a  button()  function.  has anyone else experienced this?  should i be concerned about anything else breaking in my app by overriding   with jquery mobile?
