  fixed navbar, sticky footer, dynamically scaled content  i want to achieve  this example  but with the difference that in case there is  too much  content on my page (between navbar and footer) that this content is  down-scaled  / squeezed to fit inside (i.e. so that the footer is still visible at all screen resolutions, making it a "fixed footer" in css jargon). i'm using   3.1.1 and it would be cool if anyone has a solution that is  -friendly :). best!
