Bootstrap span classes not working as expected  I wrote my first   program.         My hope was that the div class 9 will only take up 9 columns instead of entire browser width. My hope was that span6 and span3 will take up 6 and 3 columns and will be in the same row.    But the output looks like          So the rows do not appear properly (they are being cut) and also the rows and columns are not being respected. (in chrome I can see that level 1 is taking up the entire browser width) so is the 2 span6 and span3 classes. they take up entire browser width.
