create an html numeric keypad without   layout  i am trying to create an html 'numeric keypad', like those found on some keyboards. i am stumped on how to do the layout without using a table.         i am using   (v3.1.1) so my first instinct was to attempt to use its  col-  classes to reproduce the 4 columns of keys found on a keypad. this was awkward though and i couldn't easily get the sizing of the buttons to be consistent between the different levels of nested  div  containers. i failed fast.    i knew i could use a   table   based layout to accomplish this easily with  colspan s and  rowspan s. but it didn't feel right using a table layout for this, because it is clearly not tabular data.    i tried to get the benefits of tables by using the css  display  property's  table*  values. this was cleaner than my first attempt and the classes i used were more meaningful than the   ones i was attempting to use before. unfortunately, i learned that   display:table  does not support colspan/rowspan . here is  a jsfiddle of that attempt . i tried to fake a  rowspan  on the  tall-key s by using  height: 144px;  but that just increased the height of the entire row.    i gave up and ultimately created the layout with a   table  . here is  the jsfiddle .    is there a way to create a numeric keypad without using an html   table  ?    note: the heights of keys can be static values (e.g.  70px ) but the widths cannot. the width of the entire  keypad  is a variable percentage of the container, because responsive.
