responsive  3 modal textarea not working in ios  i created a vanilla   3.1.1 modal (   .com/javascript/#modals ) example for the purposes of illustrating my own feedback-form problems on an iphone 3gs (ios 6.1)    example jsbin:        here's what it looks like in the ios simulator (iphone 3gs ios 6.1):         the problem i'm having, is, as soon as you try to enter text into the feedback form, the keyboard overlay hides all of the input text.         is there a work around for this?
