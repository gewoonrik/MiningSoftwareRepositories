Responsive Bootstrap3 Modal Textarea Not working in iOS  I created a vanilla Bootstrap 3.1.1 Modal (   .com/javascript/#modals ) example for the purposes of illustrating my own feedback-form problems on an iPhone 3GS (iOS 6.1)    Example JSBin:        Here's what it looks like in the iOS Simulator (iPhone 3GS iOS 6.1):         The problem I'm having, is, as soon as you try to enter text into the feedback form, the keyboard overlay hides all of the input text.         Is there a work around for this?
