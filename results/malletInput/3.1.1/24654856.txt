WebUserControl + Bootstrap Modal  I am having a couple of Modal issues with Bootstrap 3. I have been able to get the code working in an aspx without any problem. However if i try to move the code into a Web User Control then I can't get the modal to display any more. I wondered if someone could advice me on why this is the case and if there is a fix or workaround available.    The html code for the user control is.         As I say if you put this code directly into as aspx then it will run without any issue.    Im using JQuery 1.11.0, Modernizr-2.6.2-responde-1.1.0 and Bootstrap 3.1.1    Many thanks for your time.
