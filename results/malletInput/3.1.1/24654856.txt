webusercontrol +   modal  i am having a couple of modal issues with   3. i have been able to get the code working in an aspx without any problem. however if i try to move the code into a web user control then i can't get the modal to display any more. i wondered if someone could advice me on why this is the case and if there is a fix or workaround available.    the html code for the user control is.         as i say if you put this code directly into as aspx then it will run without any issue.    im using jquery 1.11.0, modernizr-2.6.2-responde-1.1.0 and   3.1.1    many thanks for your time.    regards    james
