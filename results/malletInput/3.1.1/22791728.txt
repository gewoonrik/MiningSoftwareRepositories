as user progresses through table, i want to add more rows for possible additional data  i have a quick order form. essentially, as the customer progresses through it, i want to add more rows. that way, they always have enough rows as they need.     how can i do this? i'm using   3.1.1   jquery 1.11    what is your suggestion on when to add the new row? upon entering quantity with the item # filled out as well? upon entering item #? i'm not sure when i should add the new row, though. from a ux point of view, i'd like to do what makes the most sense.    my current code is simple:      div class="container white_bg"       div class="row" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:0;"           div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12"               h1 quickly place your order with this form. /h1               h2 please enter the item numbers that you wish to order; once you add to the cart, then you will be able to change the quantity of those items ordered. /h2               div class="table-responsive"                   form method="post" name="quickordermulti"                       table class="table table-bordered table-condensed table-hover"                           tr                               th class="active" item # /th                               th class="active" quantity /th                               th class="active" description /th                               th class="active" price /th                               th class="active" subtotal /th                           /tr                           tr                               td class="col-lg-2"                                   input type="text" name="productnumber"                               /td                               td class="col-lg-2"                                   input type="text"                               /td                               td class="col-lg-2"                               /td                               td class="col-lg-2"                               /td                               td class="col-lg-2"                               /td                           /tr                       /table                       input type="submit" value="add to cart" class="btn btn-default btn-orange"                   /form               /div           /div       /div   /div
