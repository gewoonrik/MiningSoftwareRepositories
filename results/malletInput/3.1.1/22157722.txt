Anybody else have problems with Bootstrap tables after updating to 3.1.1?  A couple of hours ago I upgraded from Bootstrap 3.0.3 to 3.1.1, and all of my tables have suddenly collapsed horizontally to minimum width.  Earlier today this table displayed fine, taking up the full width of the .container object         spreads them out without a hitch.  This has affected every table I've looked at in my application since the upgrade.    Obviously I should be able to make tables spread out by manually adding the column classes, but that also locks me into fixed proportions of width, which isn't always appropriate depending on what records are returned to fill the tables.  I'm just trying to figure out what happened here to (apparently) break the tables.  Any suggestions on what to check?
