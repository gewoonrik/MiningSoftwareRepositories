position error on a carousel gallery  i'm having some problems with my css. it's a huge css code and my specific problem is quite small so i'll try to be as general as i can. i'll use images as well as codes to explain my specific problem.     first up, here's the image:        then, here's the code for the carousel:    - /3.1.1/css/ .min.css     here's the code for the css i'm trying to apply on it:          #img{     height: 300px;     width: 300px;     position: center;     background-size: spread;     background-attachment: fixed;     }      here's the php i apply to the image from the carousel. keep in mind, i use a randomizer to let it show a different image every time:      ?php $total = "733";  $file_type = ".jpg";  $image_folder = "data1/images";  $start = "1";   $random = mt_rand($start, $total);   $image_name = $random . $file_type;   echo " div id ='img'  img src=\"$image_folder/$image_name\" alt=\"$image_name\" /  /div ";   ?       my goal is for the image that goes into the carousel to completely cover the entire carousel, the error i'm having (if you haven't noticed) is that the image automatically cover the entire carousel (including navigation arrow). sorry if the format of my question is more forum-esque. i hope someone can be of assistance.    with warm regards,      nick
