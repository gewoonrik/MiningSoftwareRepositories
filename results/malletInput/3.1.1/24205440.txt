glyphicon sometimes shows and sometimes doesnt show in my page  i downloaded v3.1.1 of   from this  link . i am using glyphicon in my asp.net mvc project.     problem i am facing is, in my view, i can see glyphicon icon sometimes and it wont load sometimes. i am confused why this is happening. this is my css :      span class="glyphicon glyphicon-circle-arrow-right" style="font-size: 3em;color:grey;"  /span       what i did is, i put  .min.css inside content folder and put fonts folder inside my project and outside content folder.     why i did like this is, when i put fonts folder inside content, it was not showing at all. so i did like this.    project structure :     projectname->content-> .min.css,  .css      projectname-> fonts     my code :      table       tr           td               h3  image  span class="glyphicon glyphicon-circle-arrow-right" style="font-size: 3em;color:grey;"  /span  /h3            /td       /tr   /table
