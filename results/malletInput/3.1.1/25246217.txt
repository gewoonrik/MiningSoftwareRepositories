  error conflicting with fancybox plugin javascript  i'm using fancybox thumbs in a   framework (v3.1.1). i keep getting this error everytime i click on the thumbnail (no errors before the click). the fancybox setup is inside a modal:      tag is to place a filter over the image (to make it visible to the user that their image was selected. i just haven't programmed the appropriate javascript function for it yet.    .
