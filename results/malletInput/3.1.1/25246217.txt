Bootstrap error conflicting with FancyBox Plugin Javascript  I'm using FancyBox Thumbs in a   framework (v3.1.1). I keep getting this error everytime I CLICK on the thumbnail (no errors before the click). The fancybox setup is inside a modal:      tag is to place a filter over the image (to make it visible to the user that their image was selected. I just haven't programmed the appropriate javascript function for it yet.    .
