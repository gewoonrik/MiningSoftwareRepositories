  3.1.1 css files not loading in windows 8  i have just started using   for a few design works for a website.  i have been using the   cdn link for the css and js files, when i am coding in linux/ubuntu , they work just fine.  but when trying out the code in windows 8, the css files are not loading at all.  i even tried downloading the   files and linked the css files from the home directory, still the result is the same.    p.s: do note that the same file when run in ubuntu works just fine, tried googling the issue, but could not find any similar issue. am i missing something here ?
