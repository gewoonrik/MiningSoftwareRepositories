    modal automatically focus on first text field  i'm using the latest version of     (v3.1.1). for some reason i can't get it to focus on the first text field. here's what i tried so far:    add  autofocus  attribute on the text field. this works but only for the first time. the second time i try to call  $el.modal('show')  again it no longer focuses on the text field with the  autofocus  attribute.    blur the button that was clicked to trigger the showing of modal and then call  .focus  on the text field where i want the focus:     $('#btn-link').click(function(){     $('#btn-link').blur();     $('#link-modal').modal('show');     $('#link_url').focus(); });      the above one doesn't work either.    lastly i tried the following:     $("#link-modal").on('shown', function(){ //also tried on 'show'     console.log('yo');     document.activeelement.blur();     $(this).find(".modal-body :input:visible").first().focus(); });      but this one doesn't work either, it doesn't focus on the text field and it doesn't even execute the  console.log . am i doing something wrong here? thanks in advance!
