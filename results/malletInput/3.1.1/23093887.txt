Twitter Bootstrap 3.1.1 navbar collapse and div issue  I am new to using Twitter Bootstrap and I have a navbar that doen't collapse as it should.    It shows well on a desktop at fullscreen (all menu items on one line) but as I collapse my browser window from left to right, the navbar items grow to become two rows before appropriately stacking one on top of the other until full collapse.    How do I make the navbar collapse as it should?    I also have a div that I want to place right below the navbar div to show a company logo (image). However, the div seems to start right at the top of the page insted of directly below the navbar div.     How do I fix this?    See:     Demo JSFiddle
