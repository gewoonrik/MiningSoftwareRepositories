    3.1.1 navbar collapse and div issue  i am new to using     and i have a navbar that doen't collapse as it should.    it shows well on a desktop at fullscreen (all menu items on one line) but as i collapse my browser window from left to right, the navbar items grow to become two rows before appropriately stacking one on top of the other until full collapse.    how do i make the navbar collapse as it should?    i also have a div that i want to place right below the navbar div to show a company logo (image). however, the div seems to start right at the top of the page insted of directly below the navbar div.     how do i fix this?    see:     demo jsfiddle
