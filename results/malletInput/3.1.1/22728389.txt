Issue with   3 buttons not having space between them when appended to the page after page load  I have an issue where I have a simple test page, with 6 buttons.  There are declared in the body of the page, and 3 are added after the page loads, using jquery. The 3 that get appended with jquery, do not have the spacing between then that the 3 that were declared in the page before it loaded do.    Here is a fiddle demonstrating the issue:        Here is the code:         How can I resolve this issue and get appended buttons to show with the same spacing as the ones that were declared in the page before load?    Thank you for your time,    Regards,    Scott
