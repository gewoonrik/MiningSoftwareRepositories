issue with   3 buttons not having space between them when appended to the page after page load  i have an issue where i have a simple test page, with 6 buttons.  there are declared in the body of the page, and 3 are added after the page loads, using jquery. the 3 that get appended with jquery, do not have the spacing between then that the 3 that were declared in the page before it loaded do.    here is a fiddle demonstrating the issue:        here is the code:      !doctype html    html lang="en" xmlns=" "   head       meta charset="utf-8" /       title   test page /title       script src=" "  /script       script src=" "  /script       link href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.1.1/css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet"       script src="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.1.1/js/ .min.js" /script   /head   body       div           div buttons in page /div           button type="button" class="btn btn-default" add /button           button type="button" class="btn btn-default" edit /button           button type="button" class="btn btn-default" delete /button       /div        div id="dynamicbuttoncontainer"           div buttons dynamically added /div        /div        script          $(document).ready(function() {             var edynamicbuttoncontainer = $('#dynamicbuttoncontainer');             edynamicbuttoncontainer.append($(' button type="button" class="btn btn-default" add /button ' +                                               ' button type="button" class="btn btn-default" edit /button ' +                                               ' button type="button" class="btn btn-default" delete /button '));         });      /script      /body   /html       how can i resolve this issue and get appended buttons to show with the same spacing as the ones that were declared in the page before load?    thank you for your time,    regards,    scott
