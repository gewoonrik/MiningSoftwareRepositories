Bootstrap. Change styles when screen is small  I've been testing Bootstrap LESS 3.1.1 a bit and found that on making the site responsive some styles don't look that well when the page is large and when it's small, etc.    So I was trying to make some changes like adding a font-weight:bold to some element or more padding or aligning it to the left, etc. just because I like the columns to collapse into one column when the screen is "xs" but that changes the layout so much I need to redefine some of the styles.    I am using custom styles and combining them with Bootstrap LESS using mixings etc. and I was wondering if there is a way of saying "do this when small" or "do this when medium". I know I have the media queries but unless I have a "@media @small" or similar it just won't fit with   as it should, and even if I go that way, I still feel like Bootstrap may already include some mixing to do that.    Does anyone know a good way to do this?    Cheers.
