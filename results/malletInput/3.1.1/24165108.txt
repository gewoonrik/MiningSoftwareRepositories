 . change styles when screen is small  i've been testing   less 3.1.1 a bit and found that on making the site responsive some styles don't look that well when the page is large and when it's small, etc.    so i was trying to make some changes like adding a font-weight:bold to some element or more padding or aligning it to the left, etc. just because i like the columns to collapse into one column when the screen is "xs" but that changes the layout so much i need to redefine some of the styles.    i am using custom styles and combining them with   less using mixings etc. and i was wondering if there is a way of saying "do this when small" or "do this when medium". i know i have the media queries but unless i have a "@media @small" or similar it just won't fit with   as it should, and even if i go that way, i still feel like   may already include some mixing to do that.    does anyone know a good way to do this?    cheers.
