Only load content of section if on mobile device  Technology used: Bootstrap 3.1.1, jQuery 1.11    Goal: I have a section where I'd only like to load the contents of it on mobile devices.     If I just used Bootstrap's visible-sm and hidden-lg classes, the content is still loaded on larger devices / sizes, creating overhead.    My section code is below. I'd like to only load   show the contents of it on a mobile device. I know the visible and hidden classes show   hide, but I want to only LOAD it on mobile devices - that's the key. No overhead.
