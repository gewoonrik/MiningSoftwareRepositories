  popover never work for me  i have problem with   popover, and i have always been confused about that, even after i read some post on stackoverflow. here is my complete code, and the popover does not work. i have no idea why. could anybody help me?          one more question that i want to ask is, when we want to use popover, tooltips function in  , do we need to include the file " -tooltips.js" and " -popover.js" as our js source? or we just need to include " .min.js" only?    really appreciate it.
