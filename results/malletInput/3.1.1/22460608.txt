Bootstrap Switch JS being called, but doing nothing  I'm using   and jQuery, but I'm currently trying to add in Bootstrap Switch. I'm starting to go insance because I cannot get it to work. From inspecting the element, it looks as though the js isn't modifying any html.    I've tried using either the gem or the straight js/css. I tried both sass and css from the gem. No matter what it looks like the js isn't doing anything. If I remove the  -switch js file then I get an error (which makes sense), so I know it's getting called. It just doesn't do anything.
