  3.1.1 glyph doesnt show in ie 8 occasionally  i have been trying to figure out as to why the glyph icon in the following html doesnt work in ie8 (about 40% of the time).         it works fine with chrome   ff. but with ie8, sometimes the glyph is shown as white box. i have followed the documentation about including html5shiv   respond js, but it is still not working reliably.    has anyone got similar experience?    edit: i have also noticed that the glyph will show when i hover the mouse over the whitebox (again, occasionally. sometimes it just wont show)    thanks in advance!    regards,    alex
