Bootstrap 3.1.1 glyph doesnt show in IE 8 occasionally  I have been trying to figure out as to why the glyph icon in the following HTML doesnt work in IE8 (about 40% of the time).         It works fine with Chrome   FF. But with IE8, sometimes the glyph is shown as white box. I have followed the documentation about including html5shiv   respond js, but it is still not working reliably.    Has anyone got similar experience?    EDIT: I have also noticed that the glyph will show when I hover the mouse over the whitebox (again, occasionally. Sometimes it just wont show)    Thanks in advance!    Regards,    Alex
