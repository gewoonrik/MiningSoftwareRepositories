  3.1.1 glyph doesnt show in ie 8 occasionally  i have been trying to figure out as to why the glyph icon in the following html doesnt work in ie8 (about 40% of the time).      !doctype html   html lang="en"   head       meta charset="utf-8"       meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge"       meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"        link href="js/lib/ /css/ .css" rel="stylesheet" type='text/css'       !--[if lt ie 9]       script src="js/lib/html5shiv/html5shiv.js" type="text/javascript"  /script       script src="js/lib/respondjs/respond.js" type="text/javascript"  /script       ![endif]--   /head   body    a       span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-left"  /span      back to home  /a   script src="js/lib/jquery/jquery-1.10.2.js" type="text/javascript"  /script   script src="js/lib/ /js/ .js" type="text/javascript"  /script    /body   /html       it works fine with chrome   ff. but with ie8, sometimes the glyph is shown as white box. i have followed the documentation about including html5shiv   respond js, but it is still not working reliably.    has anyone got similar experience?    edit: i have also noticed that the glyph will show when i hover the mouse over the whitebox (again, occasionally. sometimes it just wont show)    thanks in advance!    regards,    alex
