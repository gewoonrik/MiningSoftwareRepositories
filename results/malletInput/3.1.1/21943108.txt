  3 .img-responsive images are not responsive inside fieldset in firefox  [if you want to mark the question down, have at it, but please indicate why in the comments so that i can fix whatever is wrong with the post that two people have marked it down so far.]    in firefox (tested on win7 and win8), with the code i will post below i'm having a strange problem.    [revised] when a responsive image is inside of a   fieldset   it is no longer responsive.  this means that as my form resizes for the phone, the image will not shrink accordingly.  originally, i posted this as a problem with the carousel, but it is now clear that it is any responsive image within a   fieldset  .    i can "work-around" the issue easily, so i don't need any help with that.  however, if you know of a way to fix this, it would be greatly appreciated.    the responsive image in the code below will not be responsive to browser size in firefox (at least on win7 and win8) unless you remove the   fieldset   and   legend  .      !doctype html   html lang="en"   head       meta charset="utf-8"       meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"       title fieldset responsive image test /title       link rel="stylesheet" href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.1.1/css/ .min.css"       link rel="stylesheet" href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.1.1/css/ -theme.min.css"   /head   body   div id='content' class='container'       div class='row'           div class='col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1'               form                   fieldset                       legend i am legend /legend                           img class='img-responsive' src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,phn2zyb4bwxucz0iahr0cdovl3d3dy53my5vcmcvmjawmc9zdmciihdpzhropsi5mdaiighlawdodd0intawij48cmvjdcb3awr0ad0iotawiibozwlnahq9ijuwmcigzmlsbd0iizy2niivpjx0zxh0ihrlehqtyw5jag9ypsjtawrkbguiihg9ijq1mciget0imjuwiibzdhlszt0izmlsbdojndq0o2zvbnqtd2vpz2h0omjvbgq7zm9udc1zaxploju2chg7zm9udc1myw1pbhk6qxjpywwssgvsdmv0awnhlhnhbnmtc2vyawy7zg9taw5hbnqtymfzzwxpbmu6y2vudhjhbci+u2vjb25kihnsawrlpc90zxh0pjwvc3znpg==" alt="img" /                   /fieldset               /form           /div       /div   /div   /body   /html
