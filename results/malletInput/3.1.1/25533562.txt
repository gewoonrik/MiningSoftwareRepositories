how to add/remove 'prev' and 'next' classes to carousel slides in  ?  i'm trying to position the prev and next slides in a   carousel with css but the  .js (version 3.1.1) seems to be only very briefly adding  prev  or  next  classes to adjacent slides before stripping them and adding the  active  class (depending on which way you swipe). in order to position the prev and next slides (and not the other slides in the sequence) i want to add the  next  class to the following slide and the 'prev' class to the prev slide relative to the current slide and keep them there until the slides change:     here is the example i'm basing it off , and here is the javascript that is used:      script   $(document).ready(function() {        $("#mycarousel").swiperight(function() {             $(this).carousel('prev');               });          $("#mycarousel").swipeleft(function() {             $(this).carousel('next');      });   });    /script       the correct behavior would be the following (note the movement of the  prev ,  active  and  next  classes:       div id="mycarousel" class="carousel slide"    !-- wrapper for slides --   div class="carousel-inner"    div class="item active"     slide 1   /div    div class="item next"     slide 2   /div    div class="item"     slide 3   /div    div class="item"     slide 4   /div   /div   /div       should become:       div id="mycarousel" class="carousel slide"    !-- wrapper for slides --   div class="carousel-inner"    div class="item prev"     slide 1   /div    div class="item active"     slide 2   /div    div class="item next"     slide 3   /div    div class="item"     slide 4   /div   /div   /div       any thoughts?
