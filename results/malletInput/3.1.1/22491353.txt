how do you localize the      when downloading  s   v3.1.1 i try to use some of the reusable items. these items have english text which i can find and easily override, but there are some messages that pops up and does field validation that i cannot find -- probably because i am not familiar with the framework.     how could i proceed to find out more about these fields?     for instance, the validation messages in the  form-signin  username has a validation message. how do i override this one? where is the text located? is there a pattern/best practice for doing this kind of localization?     so if you put this example into     it becomes easy to see what happens.     field text and placeholder text is easy to localize.     but when you try to put in invalid email address you get a pop up.  how do i localize this pop up  when you put in no-email and press submit?      div class="container"     form class="form-signin" role="form"       h2 class="form-signin-heading" please sign in /h2       input type="email" class="form-control" placeholder="email address" required autofocus       input type="password" class="form-control" placeholder="password" required       label class="checkbox"         input type="checkbox" value="remember-me"        remember me      /label       button class="btn btn-lg btn-primary btn-block" type="submit" sign in /button     /form   /div
