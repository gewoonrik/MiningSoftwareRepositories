website not working on mobile - loads, then reverts to google search in 0.2 second  i have a responsive site designed with     that works fine on desktop, but not so much on mobile (tested on 2 different android devices in chrome and samsung browser, and an iphone in safari).     what works - mobile       if i type in the url with an additional page (other than index.html), i.e.  seniorcareplacementchoices.com/learn.html  it loads just fine.       what doesn't work - mobile       if i type in the url itself -  seniorcareplacementchoices.com (with or without www or   it loads for about .2 secs then goes to      seniorcareplacementchoices.com/index.html does not work either.      the only real difference between index.html and the others such as partners.html is that i added a   carousel to the index.html.    i am using site44 for hosting.     i think the problem is either:    a) the carousel is not responsive and messes up the mobile interpretation of the site b) something to do with google's new ssl rule (haven't looked much into it)    any ideas?    note: yes i do have the line
