Bootstrap Carousel auto cycle not working  I am using Bootstrap version 3.1.1    I have hidden the carousel with jquery hide(), when the user clicks a link on the page the carousel appears but the auto cycle doesn't work. It only works if I scroll on the page. I have added the following to script but it doesn't fix the problem.
