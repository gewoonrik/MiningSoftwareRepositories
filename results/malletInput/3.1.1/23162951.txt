  3.1.1 fails to build on line 233 in type.less  i updated   to 3.1.1 using bower.  it fails to build under grunt 0.4.2 using less 1.7.0. running on osx 10.8.2.  the grunt output is:     running "less:layouts" (less) task    nameerror: variable @blockquote-font-size is undefined in public/vendor/ /less/type.less on line 233, column 14:    232   margin: 0 0 @line-height-computed;    233   font-size: @blockquote-font-size;    234   border-left: 5px solid @blockquote-border-color; warning: error compiling public/less/ -build.less use --force to continue.  aborted due to warnings. bash-3.2$       @blockquote-font-size is defined in public/vendor/ /less/variables.less, same directory as type.less.  if i define it in type.less, the build breaks on a different variable, ad nauseum.    are there known interactions that could cause something like this? thanks!
