  navbar dropdown not working nothing happens when clicked       in the head part.. i declare another script src because im thinking that it cannot see the js file and also it was suggested on an another post. when i click the li labeled dropdown.. nothing happens.. sorry for this post. ive been trying to figuring this out and its already a day. googled it already and tried the given solution. but still no luck.
