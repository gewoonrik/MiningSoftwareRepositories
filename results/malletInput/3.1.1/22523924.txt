overriding webjar assets in play 2.x  just wonder, if there is a way to override some assets, precisely js and less files, in a  webjars  asset with the ones located in the  app/assets/  directory.    say, i have a    3.1.1 webjar  installed, so how do i use my own  variables.less  file for example? suppose simply putting it in the  stylesheets  folder would not work.     for less, maybe it's possible to import them from within my assets, but what about the others?
