make   navbar mobile, at a different width than default  i am having some   3.1.1 problem. i have a navbar with a good amount if list items on it. it works perfectly but when the screen gets smaller, it reaches a point where all my  ul  breaks into the next line, like this:         what i want to do to fix it, is that it shows the button that toggles the navbar when   detects a small screen width. i am so bad at media queries and despite the fact that this is probably 4 lines of css code, i can't figure it out. basically, instead of having to reach the 745px mark, it will turn into mobile at 900px for example.    if it helps, here is a codepen of the navbar:        thank you in advance so much for the help!
