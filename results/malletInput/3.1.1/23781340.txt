getting application layout to work with  4xpages  i'm using domino 9.0.1 and have managed to install correctly the   library 1.0.0.201403171254.    under application configuration/xsp properties/general i have set the theme to be      v3.1.1      and under application configuration/xsp properties/page generation. i have set up     com.ibm.xsp.extlib.library org.openntf.xsp. .library       as needed xpages libraries.    i'm having trouble making the application layout control work as i expected.    in the first tab, application layout, there is a drop-down with oneui application configuration,   application configuration, and basic application configuration. i try to put the drop-down on   application configuration, but it doesn't stick and the source still shows.    i've looked as a comparison to the demo databases and they have this  tag that i am expecting there too.    i'm not sure what to do.      ?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?   xp:view xmlns:xp=" " xmlns:xe=" "   xe:applicationlayout id="applicationlayout1"       xp:callback         facetname="facetmiddle"         id="facetmiddle"       /xp:callback       xe:this.configuration           xe:oneuiapplication titlebarname="schulungen"               xe:this.titlebartabs                   xe:basicleafnode label="link 1"  /xe:basicleafnode               /xe:this.titlebartabs                    /xe:oneuiapplication       /xe:this.configuration   /xe:applicationlayout  /xp:view
