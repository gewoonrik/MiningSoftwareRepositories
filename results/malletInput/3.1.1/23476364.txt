Initializr Bootstrap 3.1.1 - Form labels and inputs height not matching  I'm building a small website using the basic Initializr-Bootstrap 3.1.1 website template.    I use the following sample code to display a simple form: label and input field.         But I get this in Firefox:           Labels elements do not have the same height as input elements. Is there anything I can do to fix this without playing with the   css?    Seems like older versions of Bootstrap didn't have this issue.
