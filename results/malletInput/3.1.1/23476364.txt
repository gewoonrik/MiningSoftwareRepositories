initializr   3.1.1 - form labels and inputs height not matching  i'm building a small website using the basic initializr-  3.1.1 website template.    i use the following sample code to display a simple form: label and input field.         but i get this in firefox:           labels elements do not have the same height as input elements. is there anything i can do to fix this without playing with the   css?    seems like older versions of   didn't have this issue.
