 (3.1.1) glyphicons not working in firefox  i stumbled across an issue with   glyphicons not working with firefox but working with other browsers faultlessly.      q:  how to make glyphicons from   3.1.1 work with firefox?        (i answered this myself and this was part of the original post) when i sought information as to what might be causing this issue there are only a few articles that did not solve my issue focusing mainly on older versions and not explaining the required fix.    i then after some time worked out that by solely removing the 'www' from the   link href='   to the   .css  the glyphicons began working within firefox as well.    this appears to be due to the following error:  cross-origin request blocked:     i thought perhaps this worth sharing as seems there has been a fair number of people with similar issues as myself without there being any articles covering this method of fix.     change    link href="  .css" rel="stylesheet"      to     this    link href="  .css" rel="stylesheet"
