  3.1.1 doesn't work on mvc3 view page  i am new in mvc.net and i have this problem:    i'm trying to create a simple button that shows a   modal dialog but it doesn't work. the   version is 3.1.1 and jquery 1.9.0.    _layout.cshtml references:         the .css file is loaded because i can see that the styles are applied but  .js or jquery aren't and the dialog doesn't show up.
