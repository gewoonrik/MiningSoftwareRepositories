Bootstrap 3.1.1 doesn't work on MVC3 View page  I am new in MVC.NET and I have this problem:    I'm trying to create a simple button that shows a Bootstrap modal dialog but it doesn't work. The   version is 3.1.1 and jquery 1.9.0.    _Layout.cshtml references:         The .css file is loaded because I can see that the styles are applied but  .js or jquery aren't and the dialog doesn't show up.
