  3.1.1 navbar  below is the link to my current implementation of navbar using   3.1.1.       i have used container class to all nav also. is it the correct implementation ? if i dont use container class to nav , it exceeds the width of container. so i had to use it. can someone please confirm whether its the right implementation.      when i click on any button, the maincontent child div's slide up or slide down, once it crosses the nav bar , i want it to be hidden(scrolling div which you see above the nav bar), but its not hiding. i tried to add one more div above nav, but even that exceeeds the width of container though its inside container. so i tried to use container class for that also, it worked fine but when i resize my browser to small size that div disappears and again i am able to see maincontent child item moving able the nav bar.        html       meta charset=â€?utf-8â€?   meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge"   html      head       /head      body      div class="container"         div id="header"         nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-fixed-top container" role="navigation"             div class="container inside-bar"                      ul class="nav navbar-right"                       li class="active"  a href="#about" about /a  /li                       li  a href="#services" services /a  /li                       li  a href="#ourstaff" our staff /a  /li                       li  a href="#book" book /a  /li                       li  a href="#gift" gift cards /a  /li                       li  a href="#reviews" reviews /a  /li                    /ul             /div             /nav       /div             div id="maincontent"               div id='services' class="box"                 services              /div               div id='about' class="box"                 about              /div               div id='ourstaff' class="box"                 our staff              /div               div id='book' class="box"                 book              /div               div id='gift' class="box"                 gift              /div               div id='reviews' class="box"                 reviews              /div            /div          /div      /body   /html       currently in the link you will not see the div which i added before nav. please help me with this.                 thank you.
