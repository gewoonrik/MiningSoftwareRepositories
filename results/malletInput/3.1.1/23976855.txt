  3.1.1 navbar  below is the link to my current implementation of navbar using   3.1.1.       i have used container class to all nav also. is it the correct implementation ? if i dont use container class to nav , it exceeds the width of container. so i had to use it. can someone please confirm whether its the right implementation.      when i click on any button, the maincontent child div's slide up or slide down, once it crosses the nav bar , i want it to be hidden(scrolling div which you see above the nav bar), but its not hiding. i tried to add one more div above nav, but even that exceeeds the width of container though its inside container. so i tried to use container class for that also, it worked fine but when i resize my browser to small size that div disappears and again i am able to see maincontent child item moving able the nav bar.        html          currently in the link you will not see the div which i added before nav. please help me with this.                 thank you.
