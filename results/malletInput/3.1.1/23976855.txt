BootStrap 3.1.1 NavBar  Below is the link to my current implementation of Navbar using   3.1.1.       I have used container class to all Nav also. is it the correct implementation ? if i dont use container class to nav , it exceeds the width of Container. so i had to use it. can someone please confirm whether its the right implementation.      when i click on any button, the MainContent Child div's Slide up or Slide Down, once it crosses the Nav bar , i want it to be hidden(Scrolling div which you see above the Nav Bar), but its not hiding. i tried to add one more div above Nav, but even that exceeeds the width of container though its inside container. so i tried to use container class for that also, it worked fine but when i resize my browser to small size that div disappears and again i am able to see mainContent child item moving able the Nav bar.        HTML          Currently in the link you will not see the Div which i added before Nav. Please help me with this.                 Thank You.
