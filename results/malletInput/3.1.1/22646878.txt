wordpress &     image issues with stretching or max-width: 100% not working  using     v3.1.1 i created a custom wordpress theme for a client. all was going well until i realized in ie and firefox the images were showing full size and outside of the boundaries of their parent elements even though i have   css rule? this is a responsive website and i need all images to stay within their containers, not be stretched or skewed, and grow/shrink while constraining proportions as the browser size changes.
