WordPress & Twitter Bootstrap image issues with stretching or max-width: 100% not working  Using Twitter Bootstrap v3.1.1 I created a custom WordPress theme for a client. All was going well until I realized in IE and Firefox the images were showing full size and outside of the boundaries of their parent elements even though I have   CSS rule? This is a responsive website and I need all images to stay within their containers, NOT be stretched or skewed, and grow/shrink while constraining proportions as the browser size changes.
