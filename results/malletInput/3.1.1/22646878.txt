wordpress &     image issues with stretching or max-width: 100% not working  using     v3.1.1 i created a custom wordpress theme for a client. all was going well until i realized in ie and firefox the images were showing full size and outside of the boundaries of their parent elements even though i have  max-width: 100%  set.    i did some hunting around on the internet for options, naturally, and it was mentioned to put  height:auto;  on the img tag. this nearly worked, but images began to be stretched in some places, and still not obeying max-width in others.    here is an example of images in widgets in the sidebar not obeying  max-width: 100%          i hunted around some more and came across more hacks for firefox and ie. then chrome started to misbehave as well. now i have a messy stylesheet with tons of css hacks and there are still issues with images being stretched or showing full size. one of the suggestions was to mess with  box-sizing  and set the width of  img  to 100%, which results in the below with smaller images than the width of the parent container being stretched.          i'm about to go back to the drawing board where i'm only using  max-width: 100%  and start over.    my question is: how can i get all images used on wordpress to behave correctly and follow the  max-width: 100%  css rule? this is a responsive website and i need all images to stay within their containers, not be stretched or skewed, and grow/shrink while constraining proportions as the browser size changes.
