adding space between words in   3.0 (html escape characters do not work)  stackoverflow, please help!    i am developing a website using   (3.1.1) and angularjs for my friend's photography business.    the problem which i am encountering arises when trying to add a tab-space between words in the navigation bar, for example:      a href="#/" class="navbar-brand" john  #9; #9; doe /a       the only way in which i have been able to get this to work is by using   pre   tags, but this results in a completely different styling to that which is desired.    i have tried with and without using the angularjs  $sanitize  module, which had no affect.    i think i am missing something fundamental but i am obviously unsure as to what that is.    thanks in advance,    johndoe
