Adding space between words in Bootstrap 3.0 (HTML escape characters do not work)  Stackoverflow, please help!    I am developing a website using Bootstrap (3.1.1) and AngularJS for my friend's photography business.    The problem which I am encountering arises when trying to add a tab-space between words in the navigation bar, for example:      module, which had no affect.    I think I am missing something fundamental but I am obviously unsure as to what that is.    Thanks in advance,    JohnDoe
