    carousel with variable/responsive number of elements shown depending on browser size  i am using version v3.1.1 of     to make a carousel on my website.  i would like to be able to adjust the number of items shown in the carousel depending on the size of the browser/device which people are accessing the site.  for example, if i have 15 items, and the the browser is larger, go through 3 sets of 5 items visible, if smaller, show 5 sets of 3 visible at a time, and if mobile, show 15 sets of 1 visible item... it seems so simple and  a common request... but i can't find it on stack overflow or by googling.    the items are of defined dimensions, and you can assume they're pretty much like this:          i've also tried the responsive carousel here:    .  i was able to set it up as a carousel and set the default number of items visible, but couldn't figure out to modulate that in response to browser size. i tried to inspect the author's own code behind his "example carousels"  (because the ones on his site do what i want) but to no avail.    when i tried any the bootply samples in the following two links, i couldn't find any samples with multiple items in a carousel and which were responsive.    (all samples here)     (first ~15 samples here)        lastly, i tried bx slider (   ) and that worked like a charm...mostly. i got the carousel set up and it adjusted to my minslides when i made the browser narrow... only issue was that sometimes it would show a fraction of the image, but that seems to be how it's programmed and i'm not sure it's such a bad thing. this is what i'm using now.    ultimately, i'm not really a fan of  's html grammar where i have to cut up my total set of items into smaller sets as opposed to the other ones where i can just dump al the items in a div container and have javascript cut up the set as needed). i'm just looking to minimize the number of extra css and js files attached to the site. as i'm using   for the overall layout, that means looking for a   solution.
