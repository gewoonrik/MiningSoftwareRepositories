Bootstrap 3: Is there a way to hide navbar-text when small screens are used?  I'm using   3.1.1.     I want the navbar-text to disappear on smaller screens. Currently, it looks disjointed on smaller screens. Preferably, it would just go away on smaller screens but as an alternative it could render nicely under the title.
