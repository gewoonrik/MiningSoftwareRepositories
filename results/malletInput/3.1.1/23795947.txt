How can I make a tablet use same menu as phone with twitter   v 3.1.1?  I am trying to get it so that when I load my website on a tablet, specifically an iPad, in portrait mode, it uses the collapsed menu just like when I load it on my iPhone. I tried the customization feature on    .com  but it didn't work. I also tried a few different posts I saw on StackOverflow, but they didn't work for me either.
