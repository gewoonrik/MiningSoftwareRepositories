how can i make a tablet use same menu as phone with     v 3.1.1?  i am trying to get it so that when i load my website on a tablet, specifically an ipad, in portrait mode, it uses the collapsed menu just like when i load it on my iphone. i tried the customization feature on    .com  but it didn't work. i also tried a few different posts i saw on stackoverflow, but they didn't work for me either.
