Bootstrap form fields don't stay in containing div  I'd like to make a   form that looks good on web and mobile.  It seems like the straightforward markup doesn't work well.  It's an angular app, but I don't think angular figures in...    One problem is if I try to contain several fields by a div in order to apply a background color, the fields aren't contained, spilling off the left side of the div.    Another problem, related I think, is that the fields appear on mobile with 0px left and right margins, which doesn't look too good.    Here's the markup:    in index .html:         And here's the bad result:  see how fields spill off to the left?    On Web....         About what it looks like on mobile...
