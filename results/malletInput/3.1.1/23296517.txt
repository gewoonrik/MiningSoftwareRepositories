  form fields don't stay in containing div  i'd like to make a   form that looks good on web and mobile.  it seems like the straightforward markup doesn't work well.  it's an angular app, but i don't think angular figures in...    one problem is if i try to contain several fields by a div in order to apply a background color, the fields aren't contained, spilling off the left side of the div.    another problem, related i think, is that the fields appear on mobile with 0px left and right margins, which doesn't look too good.    here's the markup:    in index .html:         and here's the bad result:  see how fields spill off to the left?    on web....         about what it looks like on mobile...
