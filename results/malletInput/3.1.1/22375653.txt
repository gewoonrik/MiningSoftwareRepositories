  with datatable integration design issue php  i'm using latest version of     v.3.1.1 (   .com/ ) and integrating the same with datatables (   _ _2 )    the files and versions are as follows:       .css           -   v.3.1.1    .min.js        -   v.3.1.1   jquery.datatables.js    -   v.1.9.4   dt_ .js         -   not given      if i use the above file, the pagination, search and sorting are working fine. but the design is shuffled (i.e search box, page numbers etc.. are looking ugly without any style applied).    i can over-come the design issues if i change the  .css-v.3.1.1 to  .min.css-v.2.3.2 but my header, footer and other designs are getting collapsed.    when i analyzed both the css i.e. 3.1.1 and 2.3.2 - i came to know that many class files are missing in 3.1.1. the one such missing class files are .span6(and still there are lot more) from my knowledge.    now, how to fix the design issue or where shall i find the udpated one.    have anyone came across this issue?
