Django allauth + twitter  , request.user.is_authenticated doesn't show correct navbar  I'm new to django and have a small problem, which I cannot resolve. I use django-allauth for authentification and twitter-  for front-page. I want to create a page which is different whether user is logged in or not. So in {% block header %} I check it to show the correct buttons. However, I don't get anything(no Home, News, Dashboard and Data) if I'm not logged in, and I see four of them if I log in. Please help!
