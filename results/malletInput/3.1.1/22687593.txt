  3 navbar-top-fixed issue in android webview  I am working on a webapp which uses the latest   (3.1.1). I use this carousel sample app to build the main skeleton of the app.     In each of the slides I will have my actual page content. In one of the slides I generate tables with a different width.     The problem seems to appear only in Android Webview when the width of the table is bigger than the actual width of the device. The navbar gets white or invisible. I am not sure, but I can not see it. I am able to click on the navbar toggle(even though doesn't appear) and it does show the navbar items.     Did anybody else had this problem before ? It only seems to happen in the android webview. I tested this in chrome for android and everything works as expected.     I will try to reproduce this in a fiddle, but I hope I can get some tips by then.  Florin.     UPDATE: fiddle here:     (please test the fiddle in Android webview).
