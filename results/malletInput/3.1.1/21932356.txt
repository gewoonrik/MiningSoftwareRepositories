Bootstrap 3.1.1 with iOS Emulator  In my site I used Bootstrap 3.0.2. All is working pretty great both on desktop and in my iOS emulator, where I test it for iPhone users.     However, when I tried to changed to Bootstrap 3.1.1, I can't seem to click on anything in my Web App (not links, not buttons, etc.). The site with 3.1.1 works pretty good on my desktop (with safari).     Any thoughts on why this happens?      Update:      Did a little debugging, and the problem seems to be with this line I use:      $('.modal-backdrop').remove();     This is a hack I use to clear a modal that .modal('hide') didn't take care of for some reason. Can anyone think of why this makes the iOS stop responding to clicks?     Thanks
