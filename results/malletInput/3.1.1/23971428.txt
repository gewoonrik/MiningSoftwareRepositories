twitter   3 button 1px too small  I use the twitter   3. I have added a navbar form with an input group into my navigation bar.    The problem is that my button is 1px smaller then the search field. With my compilled version of twitter   the button is smaller. But If I use the original twitter   3.1.1 pre-compiled css, the button is 34px high.    Here is my navigation bar:         Any help appreciated
