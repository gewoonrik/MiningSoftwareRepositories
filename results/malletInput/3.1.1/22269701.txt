trouble with background img in   3.1.1 with parallax  i am having major trouble adding a background image to my   site. i am trying to create a parallax site using stellar.js so far the site works ok, i have some text on each slide, the links scroll to the correct slides etc etc...but the images wont seem to load up. i have looked through this site, youtube and many others but i just cant seem to get the bastard image to display lol    i got my background images in the following folder. img/slide1bg.jpg so its only up one dir. maybe i am missing something, but i have attempted to combind the tutoiral from  here:  with  ...the following code worked fine for background images, but within   it doesnt seem to like it.    my html:      div class="slide" id="slide1" data-slide="1" data-stellar-background-ratio="0.5"       div class="container"           div class="slidetext"              //text here          /div       /div   /div       my css:     html, body{ width: 100%; height: 100%; padding: 0; margin: 0; }  .slide{ position: relative; background-attachment: fixed; width: 100%; height: 100%; }  #slide1{ color: pink; background: url('./img/slide1bg.jpg') no-repeat; background-size: cover;     -webkit-background-size: cover;     -moz-background-size: cover;     -o-background-size: cover; } .slidetext{ padding-top: 70px; }
