Nested   3.1.1 collapse  Hi i wonder if someone can help. I'm using Bootstrap 3.1.1 and using nested collapse menus for a sidenav. I want to add a background colour (using a class) to the open menu and remove the background colour on the menu close.    This is working fine, however when i have nested menus the code i'm using removes the background colour for the parent item when closing the child menu and i can't work out how to only remove the background colour if its a top level menu close. So if its a child menu this should not remove the background colour when closing the child menu.         Please see  JSFiddle
