format php database data  what i would like to know is when i grab data from a database how can i format it with php so it looks nice. all i seem to be getting is a blank white page and when i inspect the page with google chromes inspect element it says that i've got a 500 internal error.    for example, i'm using pdo to connect to the database. heres my code:         so how would i put the name into a h1 tag and the description into p tag.    thanks
