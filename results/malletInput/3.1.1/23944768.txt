Format PHP database data  What I would like to know is when I grab data from a Database how can I format it with PHP so it looks nice. All i seem to be getting is a Blank white page and when i inspect the page with google chromes inspect element it says that i've got a 500 internal error.    For example, I'm using PDO to connect to the database. Heres my code:         So how would I put the name into a H1 tag and the description into P tag.    Thanks
