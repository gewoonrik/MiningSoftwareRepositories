why are my   modal images not showing?  i am trying to build an extremely simple image gallery with   3.    it is just a few thumbnails and when you click on one of them, a modal window appearing on top with the real size image.    this is the code i have so far:      div class="container"       div class="row"          {% for foto in fotos %}              div class="col-md-2 "                   a href="#launch{{loop.index}}" data-toggle="modal"                       img class="photo-grid" src="{{foto.thumb_url}}" border="0"                   /a               /div          {% endfor %}      /div   /div  {% for foto in fotos %}      section id="launch{{loop.index}}" class="modal hide fade"           div               div class="modal-body"                   img src="{{foto.big_url}}"               /div           /div       /section  {% endfor %}      so basically it is a jinja2 template receiving a list of information with links to images.    the thumbnail images are showing properly, but when i click on one of them i expect to see a modal window appearing on top and showing the image in bigger size. but that is not happening.    i have checked that the data  foto.thumb_url  and  foto.big_url  are correct.    this is how i import  :      link href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.1.1/css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet"   script src=" "  /script   script src="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.1.1/js/ .min.js"  /script       any ideas on what i am missing in my code?
