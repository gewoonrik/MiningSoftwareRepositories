Bootstrap collapse navbar works on jsfiddle, doesn't work on actual website  I usually find answers to my simple questions without asking but not this time.  It's been several days so I thought I'd ask.      The html code I have below:      You'll see I tried to do a few things to make see what was wrong   I tested to make sure the js libraries were loading (both Google and jquery)   I tried redownloading  .min.js from   website (no change)   I tried getting  .min.js via CDN   I'm sure the answer is simple, but I can't quite figure it out (jsfiddle link at bottom)      Any help would be much appreciated.         Here's the jsfiddle where it's working -
