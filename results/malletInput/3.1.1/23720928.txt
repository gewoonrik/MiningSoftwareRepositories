revealjs not adjusting properly inside twitter    I am trying to add  revealjs  inside  twitter  ,  it seems to be appearing but not properly. Please note it is only the appearance that is not right, it seems to jump from slide to slide just fine.    There are two problems with it      The size of revealjs slides is really small, i have not changed anything in css that could have caused this but I did find out that the slides seem to be appearing fine if i dont integrate them with  .   The background of revealjs fills the whole screen instead of the div where slides/sections are being placed.      This is what my screen looks like      This is what my page html looks like with twitter   and revealjs slide sections inside class      I will really appreciate any assistance in this
