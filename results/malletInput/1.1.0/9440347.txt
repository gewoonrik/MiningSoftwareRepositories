Can't get initializr's HTML5 Boilerplate Bootstrap 2 package to load CSS when using LESS compiler app    I have decided to start using HTML5BP and Bootstrap2 (with responsive option) as my starting point for future projects, and thought that Initializr.com's package generator was a great way to get the two offerings working. So I downloaded the Initializr package, with the boilerplate, Responsive Bootstrap 2, modernizr, respond, jQuery development, LESS, and IE classes options selected.    Everything went as expected after placing the zipped package's contents into a clean working folder. And opening the index.html file properly displayed the expected Bootstrap styled "hero" template. Which was great for local development, but I wanted to be able to compile the LESS files locally and upload a proper CSS file to my sever for production code.    Enter SimpLESS/LESS.app and my first roadblock.    When using SimpLESS/LESS.app, one is supposed remove the following 2 lines from index.html (according to the comments in that file):         UPDATE: found the answer, will post it when stackoverflow allows me :)
