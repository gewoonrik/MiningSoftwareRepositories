can't get initializr's html5 boilerplate   2 package to load css when using less compiler app    i have decided to start using html5bp and  2 (with responsive option) as my starting point for future projects, and thought that initializr.com's package generator was a great way to get the two offerings working. so i downloaded the initializr package, with the boilerplate, responsive   2, modernizr, respond, jquery development, less, and ie classes options selected.    everything went as expected after placing the zipped package's contents into a clean working folder. and opening the index.html file properly displayed the expected   styled "hero" template. which was great for local development, but i wanted to be able to compile the less files locally and upload a proper css file to my sever for production code.    enter simpless/less.app and my first roadblock.    when using simpless/less.app, one is supposed remove the following 2 lines from index.html (according to the comments in that file):         update: found the answer, will post it when stackoverflow allows me :)
