Modernizr + Bootstrap 2/3 => browser's scrollbar disappears  I use Twitter Bootstrap 3.0-RC1 combining with Modernizr 2.6.2.  (the issue is also reproducible with Bootstrap 2.X.X)    I struggled to find why my browser didn't show any scrollbar, traditionally on the right side. (of course I tried to minimize my browser's window in order to see it)    I first found  this  post, potentially linked with my issue, since I also use the      the whole works meaning the scrollbar appears.    Is it a normal behavior from modernizr to remove scrollbar regarding some context?
