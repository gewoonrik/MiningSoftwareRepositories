modernizr +   2/3 => browser's scrollbar disappears  i use     3.0-rc1 combining with modernizr 2.6.2.  (the issue is also reproducible with   2.x.x)    i struggled to find why my browser didn't show any scrollbar, traditionally on the right side. (of course i tried to minimize my browser's window in order to see it)    i first found  this  post, potentially linked with my issue, since i also use the  navbar  component of  .    i find that when i remove the second line of this snippet:       link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="stylesheets/ .min.css"   script src="javascripts/modernizr-2.6.2-respond-1.1.0.min.js" type="text/javascript"  /script       the whole works meaning the scrollbar appears.    is it a normal behavior from modernizr to remove scrollbar regarding some context?
