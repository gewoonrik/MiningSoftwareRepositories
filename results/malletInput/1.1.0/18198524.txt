modernizr +   2/3 => browser's scrollbar disappears  i use     3.0-rc1 combining with modernizr 2.6.2.  (the issue is also reproducible with   2.x.x)    i struggled to find why my browser didn't show any scrollbar, traditionally on the right side. (of course i tried to minimize my browser's window in order to see it)    i first found  this  post, potentially linked with my issue, since i also use the      the whole works meaning the scrollbar appears.    is it a normal behavior from modernizr to remove scrollbar regarding some context?
