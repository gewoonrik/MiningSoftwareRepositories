dropdown markup not working in   2.2  this markup alone absolutely works to trigger a dropdown with   1.1.0.      but in v2.2, the markup alone no longer works.  i need to initiate the dropdown with js (calling the dropdown() method).  any thoughts on why?     http:// docs.com/v2.2.0/docs/javascript.html#dropdowns
