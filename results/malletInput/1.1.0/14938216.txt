Including two bundles which are using the same subbundle  Im trying to use the following two bundles in my symfony2.1 project:       sonata-admin bundle     braincrafted  -bundle       My problem is, the two bundles use both  knp-menu bundle . But sonata needs 1.1.x-dev of knp-menu bundle and braincrafted  -bundle dev-master.    With the following composer settings i get the following error. Composer.json:           Has someone an idea how can i use both bundles or isn't there a way? Thanks for help.
