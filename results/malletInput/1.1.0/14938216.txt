including two bundles which are using the same subbundle  im trying to use the following two bundles in my symfony2.1 project:       sonata-admin bundle     braincrafted  -bundle       my problem is, the two bundles use both  knp-menu bundle . but sonata needs 1.1.x-dev of knp-menu bundle and braincrafted  -bundle dev-master.    with the following composer settings i get the following error. composer.json:           "sonata-project/admin-bundle": "dev-master",     "sonata-project/doctrine-orm-admin-bundle": "dev-master",     "sonata-project/intl-bundle": "dev-master",     "sonata-project/cache-bundle": "dev-master",     "knplabs/knp-menu-bundle": "1.1.x-dev",     "braincrafted/ -bundle": "dev-develop"        error: knp\menu\matcher\voter\voterinterface' not found in vendor/braincrafted/ -bundle/braincrafted/ bundle/voter/requestvoter    i know that the matcher doesn't exist in the early knp menu bundle version. but if i change the knp menu bundle version to:        "knplabs/knp-menu-bundle": "dev-master",      it isn't possible to install the sonata admin bundle. the following error occurs if i execute the command "composer.phar update"       problem 1     - sonata-project/admin-bundle dev-master requires knplabs/knp-menu-bundle  =1.1.0, 2.0.x-dev -  satisfiable by knplabs/knp-menu-bundle 1.1.x-dev, knplabs/knp-menu-bundle 1.1.x-dev, knplabs/knp-menu-bundle v1.1.0.     - sonata-project/admin-bundle dev-master requires knplabs/knp-menu-bundle  =1.1.0, 2.0.x-dev -  satisfiable by knplabs/knp-menu-bundle 1.1.x-dev, knplabs/knp-menu-bundle 1.1.x-dev, knplabs/knp-menu-bundle v1.1.0.     - can only install one of: knplabs/knp-menu-bundle dev-master, knplabs/knp-menu-bundle 1.1.x-dev.     - can only install one of: knplabs/knp-menu-bundle dev-master, knplabs/knp-menu-bundle 1.1.x-dev.     - can only install one of: knplabs/knp-menu-bundle v1.1.0, knplabs/knp-menu-bundle dev-master.     - installation request for knplabs/knp-menu-bundle dev-master -  satisfiable by knplabs/knp-menu-bundle dev-master.     - installation request for sonata-project/admin-bundle dev-master -  satisfiable by sonata-project/admin-bundle dev-master.      has someone an idea how can i use both bundles or isn't there a way? thanks for help.
