display inline errors with simple_form in a   ajax modal  i've found similar stackoverflow questions  here  and  here  but still can't get this to work.    i'm using rails 3.2.8, simpleform 2.0.4, and     2.1.1 (via the  -sass gem 2.1.1.0).    the user should be able to add a contact from a modal popup window. if there are validation errors, they should appear inline, just as if the user were using a non-modal version of the form (red border around field, error message next to field).    i load the modal like this:      as a javascript file, not a json variable? or is there an easier way to handle this altogether?
