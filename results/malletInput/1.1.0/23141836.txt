Bootstrap 3 Default Android Browser Testing  This is part of a website I am working on that uses   3.On desktop it all works fine when resizing it on all browers and on mobile when using the chrome browser there does nt seem to be any issues. The problem I am having is that the sashes or ribbons do not respond or resize correctly when using the default android browser on mobile devices. The ribbons or free bets sashes appear about 20 or 30 px down from the top of the box they are suppose to be attached to. I was wondering if anybody could help me in identify this problem.    I also I was wondering if there is any websites or software for testing offline files for mobile responive viewing. Here is the html page
