  switch js being called, but doing nothing  i'm using   and jquery, but i'm currently trying to add in   switch. i'm starting to go insance because i cannot get it to work. from inspecting the element, it looks as though the js isn't modifying any html.    i've tried using either the gem or the straight js/css. i tried both sass and css from the gem. no matter what it looks like the js isn't doing anything. if i remove the  -switch js file then i get an error (which makes sense), so i know it's getting called. it just doesn't do anything.    below is pieces of my setup:    gems     using sass (3.3.2) using  -sass (3.1.1.0) using  -switch-rails (2.0.2) using jquery-rails (3.1.0) using sass-rails (4.0.1)      application.css.scss     @import " "; @import " 3-switch";      application.js     //= require jquery //= require jquery_ujs //= require   //= require  -switch // //= require_tree .      other.js     $("#famous-people-switch"). switch();      some.html.erb      div class="col-md-6"     input id="famous-people-switch" type="checkbox" name="famous-people" checked     h4 famous people: /h4   /div
