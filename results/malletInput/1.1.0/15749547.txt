getting   tabs to fill height automatically down to footer?  i'm having the following issue:    i have a   based header row, tabbed content row with 3 columns, and footer row. i would like the tabbed content row to make use of the max available screen space up to the footer. this should always result in an even line of the bottom of 3 tabbed areas.     i've tried several things referenced here in the past, but wasn't able to make any of them work for me correctly.     i've set up a jsfiddle with an example of my problem:        here's my sloppy example code:         thanks for any help you can provide.
