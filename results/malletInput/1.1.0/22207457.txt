jqm buttons won't enhance with backbone.js, underscore.js, and    i have an app that is using backbone.js to manage models, views, and collections, underscore.js to handle view templates, and jquery mobile and   for the user interface.  many of my view templates have buttons in them, but when the view is rendered the buttons will not enhance.  everything in the view is enhanced but the buttons.    see the screenshot showing a portion of a form in one of my views:         as you can see, the   function.  has anyone else experienced this?  should i be concerned about anything else breaking in my app by overriding   with jquery mobile?
