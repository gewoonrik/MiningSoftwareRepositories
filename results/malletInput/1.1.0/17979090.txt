remove scrollbars from parent window when fancybox loads  i've searched for this topic, i am sure there is a solution out there but i'm not looking for the right thing...    i am using a customized version of     2.x (fluid responsive) with top and bottom full-width fixed navigation bars and fancybox 2.1.4      meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"       .min.css     -responsive.min.css    modernizr-2.6.2-respond-1.1.0.min.js    jquery.fancybox-media.js?v=1.0.5    jquery.fancybox.css?v=2.1.4    jquery.fancybox.js?v=2.1.4    anyways, my problem is occurring while using fancybox. all of my fancybox content is using iframes (even the content without iframes appears to do the same thing but i figured i would include that).     when you click on a link the fancbox box appears on the screen and then the parent window produces a scrollbar (behind the fancybox). it isn't hurting anything but it just looks tacky. i am producing html5 content to go in a kiosk so i do not want scrollbars to appear.
