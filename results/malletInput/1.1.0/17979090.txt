Remove Scrollbars from Parent Window when Fancybox Loads  I've searched for this topic, I am sure there is a solution out there but I'm not looking for the right thing...    I am using a customized version of Twitter Bootstrap 2.x (Fluid Responsive) with top and bottom full-width fixed navigation bars and Fancybox 2.1.4          .min.css     -responsive.min.css    modernizr-2.6.2-respond-1.1.0.min.js    jquery.fancybox-media.js?v=1.0.5    jquery.fancybox.css?v=2.1.4    jquery.fancybox.js?v=2.1.4    Anyways, my problem is occurring while using fancybox. All of my fancybox content is using iframes (even the content without iframes appears to do the same thing but i figured i would include that).     When you click on a link the fancbox box appears on the screen and then the parent window produces a scrollbar (behind the fancybox). It isn't hurting anything but it just looks tacky. I am producing HTML5 content to go in a kiosk so I do not want scrollbars to appear.
