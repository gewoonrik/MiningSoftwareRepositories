Overriding Bootstrap Nav Background-Color  I am trying to override the default Twitter Bootstrap Nav by having a main.css (see below) override the nav classes but changes are not being applied.    Here is my index.html         That background color shows up on the Chrome dev tool as the current property being used and all other background properties seem to have been overwritten but I still don't see the change.
