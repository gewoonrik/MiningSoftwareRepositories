what is the latest jquery version to work with ie8?  i'm working on a   3 site and i was having some issues with the jquery version that i was using (1.9.1). i upgraded to 2.1.0 and my issues are gone, however, this breaks ie8 compatibility since 2.1.0 doesn't support ie8 anymore and jquery seizes to work in this browser.    i can't use 1.1.0 because   supports  1.9.0 or higher  (also i'll have my issues back).     so the question is: which is the highest version of jquery that works with ie8?    the  jquery browser support page  only lists 1.11.0 and 1.9.1 so that's not helping.
