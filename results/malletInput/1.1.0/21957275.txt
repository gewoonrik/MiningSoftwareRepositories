used   framework website looks good when resized but not on iphone  i have used   framework and a template from a book to finally make the master page the way i want.    when i use google chrome, or ie, and i resize the browsers, the page is resized and the menu is converted to a vertical menu.    however, i just tried on the iphone and it shows "like" a big browser, instead of showing the vertical menu.    i wish i could paste the code but the   code is way too long to copy here.    i will show my website:        and i will paste the html of my masterpage.
