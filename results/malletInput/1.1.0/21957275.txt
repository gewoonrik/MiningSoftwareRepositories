Used   framework website looks good when resized but not on iphone  I have used   framework and a template from a book to finally make the master page the way I want.    When I use google chrome, or IE, and I resize the browsers, the page is resized and the menu is converted to a vertical menu.    However, I just tried on the iphone and it shows "like" a big browser, instead of showing the vertical menu.    I wish I could paste the code but the   code is way too long to copy here.    I will show my website:        And I will paste the html of my masterpage.
