What is the jQuery Mobile 1.1.0 - Position-Fixed Method  jQuery Mobile 1.1.0 Final was just released and promises:        "True fixed toolbars: Lightweight, CSS-based   broadly compatible"      What is the  specific  fix they have to  solve all  the   headaches in mobile browsers?    I have a Desktop App (twitter   based) that has postion:fixed toolbars that do not work well on mobile browsers? I would like to incorporate the specifix fix without all the other functionality and CSS jQuery Mobile ships with.
