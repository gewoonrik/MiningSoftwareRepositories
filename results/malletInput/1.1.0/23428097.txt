using font awesome for setting up the look of glyphicons  i have the following html code:      a href="test"     span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"  /span   /a       i'd like to change how this arrow looks like in some ways: make it smaller, thinner. i heard it could be done via font awesome. i did some research but couldn't understand how i could do this. could you guys help me or give a general direction?    some of the gems i'm using:     ruby "2.1.1"  gem "rails", "4.1.0"  gem "sass-rails", "~  4.0.0" gem "compass-rails", "~  1.1.2" gem " -sass", "~  3.1.1.0" gem "haml-rails"
