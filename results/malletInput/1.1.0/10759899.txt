JQuery Mobile, Bootstrap and CSS3 Media Queries, what combination to choose  JQuery Mobile, Bootstrap and CSS3 Media Queries    What combination to use    To have an UI Framework we all should use something like Bootstrap.  To develop for Mobile I need something which makes it easy to switch pages within one HTML file, like JQuery Mobile (JQM) does. To develop for different screen-widths (iPhone, iPad, etc) I need to develop according to Responsive Webdesign rules.     JQM does not support Media Queries according to     where it says that the helper classes are deprecated. It points you to Media Queries, of which there are no good examples unless you use Bootstrap or Skeleton    When looking for information to combine Bootstrap with JQM there are no good examples apart from Andy Matthews who created a Bootstrap theme in JQM.        So, what is common practice in developing WebApps with a responsive webdesign? Are people ignoring JQM (and doing the page-in-html stuff themselves) or are they ignoring Bootstrap (and doing the responsive webdesign by hand with media queries in JQM) ?    Or is there an overall solution covering everything to de WebApp development with? (Please don't say PhoneGap)    To add some info on my quest for clarity: I have the following lines in my header of index.html:         Bit much according to my opinion? Or is this correct? Hope anybody of the more experienced WebApp developers can shed any light on this.     Thanks,
