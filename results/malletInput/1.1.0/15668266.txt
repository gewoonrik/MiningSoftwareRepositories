  editable rails type select has empty results  I'm trying to use the type =  select with the gem ' -editable-rails'.    The field pops up and there is a select box, but the values don't show up.    The Task record has a foreign key = rating_id and the value I want to show from the rating table is = ratingname    This is my view code:         So, the dropdown list is good, the update is good.    BUT, the popup box with the rating select list turns red and doesn't go away!  And there are no errors in the browser console.
