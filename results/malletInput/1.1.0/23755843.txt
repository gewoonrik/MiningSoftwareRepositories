prevent   divs from pushing down, and allow one div to take up 'the rest of the screen width'?  so i've been using   in an asp.net mvc5 website the site had been designed to have a div on the left - with a list of countries, and then the main content body in the middle    there is now a requirement to add some banner advertising on the right hand side of the page here is a reduced form of the html;         the left hand div contains a list of countries and cities, and this is about a full screen's height, and some of the countries will cause the screen to scroll vertically. this is okay, and by design. there are a couple of problems i've discovered though... randomly (i can't seem to reproduce it, but i see it happen), the main body content gets pushed down below the left hand div which contains the countries. i suspect this is because it's considered to be going too far to the right.    can i ensure that the main body div /never/ gets pushed down, and will always be on the right of the country list? if the screen does need to scroll horizontally, then grand, so be it :)    also what i've noticed is that if i put two images side by side at the bottom of the main div's content, one gets pushed below the other. so the col-md-10 div seems to be constraining its width somehow. i'd like this to just take up as much space as it needs if possible...
