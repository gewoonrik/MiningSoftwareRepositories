  css with updatepanel partial rendering in asp.net  i'm using  -  style in my asp.net application with master-content architecture (code below). on first load everything is ok, two span6 divs side by side, top menu normal.. i checked @media style and it's ok for both divs. when any of the update panels execute partial rendering (click on tree in left update panel) everything changes. major and i think crucial problem is that now the @media is changed (now is @media (max-width: 767px) and before update was @media (min-width: 1200px)). this changing display page in wide monitor as you open in tablet or some small resolution and this happening only on update panel partial rendering. does anyone have experience with this type of bug?    master code:
