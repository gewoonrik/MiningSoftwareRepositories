How to access Bootstrap Files individually  Now that Bootstrap is running in Rails, I want to have full access to all Bootstrap-files, to exclude (or include) assets as I wish, and additionally add my own assets, variables - which I did (and found easy) before I started to learn Rails.    My question: Would it be a good practise to copy the whole   folder from   which is there by default?    Thanks!
