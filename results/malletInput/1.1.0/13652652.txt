   : understanding the scaffolding / grid  i am working with   and am having a strange layout issue in my fixed (not responsive) layout.    using the bs scaffolding syntax, i have several nested divs in my grid. usually looks/works fine; however, sometimes when i reload the page divs break throughout the page (header nav, divs in main content, etc.)    i cannot recreate this problem, it just seems to act the way it wants when it wants (again, when i refresh/reload).       here are screenshots of what the issue looks like when it happens, and what it should always look like:    good 1        bad 1        (i cannot add more urls to this post; if you want to see more, the above 2 can be changed to 3487/ss-2-good.jpg   3484/ss-2-bad.jpg)       steps taken (to no positive effect):    -redo the grid     -go through my custom css line by line, seeing if removing portions solves the problem    -confirm paths, file order in webpage, etc.    -search, search and search again       here is the basic html structure:         div class="container"     ?php require ("includes/nav-top.php") ;?     !--page header --     div class="row" id=""       div class="span6"           ... content ...      /div       div class="span6"          ... content ...      /div     /div     div class="row"         ... content ...    /div     div class="row-fluid"       div class="span8"         div class="span6"            ... content ...        /div           div class="span6"            ... content ...        /div           div class="row-fluid"           div class="span6"              ... content ...          /div           div class="span6"              ... content ...          /div         /div         !--row-fluid--         /div       !--span8--        div class="span4"         ... content ...      /div       !--span4--       /div     !--row--      div id="" class="row"       div class="span4"          ... content ...      /div       div class="span4"        ... content ...      /div       div class="span4"       ... content ...      /div     /div     !--row--      footer     ... content ...    /footer   /div   !--container--          i am loading the external files like this:    head:      link href='  rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'  ;  link href='  rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'    link rel="stylesheet" href="css/ .css"    link rel="stylesheet" href="css/ -config.css"   link rel="stylesheet" href="css/font-awesome.css"   script src="js/vendor/modernizr-2.6.1-respond-1.1.0.min.js"  /script       before the closing body tag:      script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.js"  /script    script window.jquery || document.write(' script src="js/vendor/jquery-1.8.2.js"  \/script ') /script    script src="js/vendor/ .min.js"  /script   ?php require('includes/i-modal.php');?   ?php require('includes/i-googleanalytics.php');?   ?php require_once('includes/i-js.php'); ?          notes:    -like i said, this could happen 10x in a row, then the next 5 refreshes/reloads and it looks fine    -in the above files loaded in there is an include for fancybox (i-modal.php) as well as custom js (i-js.php). there is no css or anything else in those files which seems like it might trigger this.    -currently the bs overwrites ( -config.css) is empty; seemingly, when i add anything to it the problem kicks in, whether or not what little i add has margin or padding.    -from my research it looks like my use of "row-fluid" for nested grid sections is allowable in the otherwise fixed layout    -so far, testing on safari / osx, have not seen the problem in other browsers, but as i said it happens when it chooses to.       so. after all this, i guess i am wondering what these symptoms might suggest to the knowledgeable out there.   is outstanding, in many ways the tool of my dreams - has anyone experienced anything like this?    thanks for reading this.
