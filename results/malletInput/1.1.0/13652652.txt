Twitter Bootstrap: understanding the scaffolding / grid  I am working with Bootstrap and am having a strange layout issue in my fixed (not responsive) layout.    Using the BS scaffolding syntax, I have several nested divs in my grid. Usually looks/works fine; however, sometimes when I reload the page divs break throughout the page (header nav, divs in main content, etc.)    I cannot recreate this problem, it just seems to act the way it wants when it wants (again, when I refresh/reload).       Here are screenshots of what the issue looks like when it happens, and what it should always look like:    good 1        bad 1        (I cannot add more URLS to this post; if you want to see more, the above 2 can be changed to 3487/ss-2-good.jpg   3484/ss-2-bad.jpg)       Steps taken (to no positive effect):    -redo the grid     -go through my custom CSS line by line, seeing if removing portions solves the problem    -confirm paths, file order in webpage, etc.    -search, search and search again       Here is the basic HTML structure:            NOTES:    -like I said, this could happen 10x in a row, then the next 5 refreshes/reloads and it looks fine    -in the above files loaded in there is an include for Fancybox (i-modal.php) as well as custom JS (i-js.php). There is no CSS or anything else in those files which seems like it might trigger this.    -currently the BS overwrites ( -config.css) is empty; seemingly, when I add anything to it the problem kicks in, whether or not what little I add has margin or padding.    -from my research it looks like my use of "row-fluid" for nested grid sections is allowable in the otherwise fixed layout    -so far, testing on Safari / OSX, have not seen the problem in other browsers, but as I said it happens when it chooses to.       SO. After all this, I guess I am wondering what these symptoms might suggest to the knowledgeable out there. Bootstrap is outstanding, in many ways the tool of my dreams - has anyone experienced anything like this?    Thanks for reading this.
