   : understanding the scaffolding / grid  i am working with   and am having a strange layout issue in my fixed (not responsive) layout.    using the bs scaffolding syntax, i have several nested divs in my grid. usually looks/works fine; however, sometimes when i reload the page divs break throughout the page (header nav, divs in main content, etc.)    i cannot recreate this problem, it just seems to act the way it wants when it wants (again, when i refresh/reload).       here are screenshots of what the issue looks like when it happens, and what it should always look like:    good 1        bad 1        (i cannot add more urls to this post; if you want to see more, the above 2 can be changed to 3487/ss-2-good.jpg   3484/ss-2-bad.jpg)       steps taken (to no positive effect):    -redo the grid     -go through my custom css line by line, seeing if removing portions solves the problem    -confirm paths, file order in webpage, etc.    -search, search and search again       here is the basic html structure:            notes:    -like i said, this could happen 10x in a row, then the next 5 refreshes/reloads and it looks fine    -in the above files loaded in there is an include for fancybox (i-modal.php) as well as custom js (i-js.php). there is no css or anything else in those files which seems like it might trigger this.    -currently the bs overwrites ( -config.css) is empty; seemingly, when i add anything to it the problem kicks in, whether or not what little i add has margin or padding.    -from my research it looks like my use of "row-fluid" for nested grid sections is allowable in the otherwise fixed layout    -so far, testing on safari / osx, have not seen the problem in other browsers, but as i said it happens when it chooses to.       so. after all this, i guess i am wondering what these symptoms might suggest to the knowledgeable out there.   is outstanding, in many ways the tool of my dreams - has anyone experienced anything like this?    thanks for reading this.
