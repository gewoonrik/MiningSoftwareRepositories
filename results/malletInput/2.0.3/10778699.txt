  grid not adjusting before text flows outside of container  i am not that advanced on css so i wanted to ask someone before reporting this as a problem.    i am using the latest (v2.0.3)   hero example to show this issue.  when i create a single_long_word of text greater than about 1/2 the column size (due to a large font or simply a large number of characters in a single word), the text is allowed to go outside of its column before the layout adjusts when i re-size the browser window to make it smaller.      all i had to do was change the text in the column to make a large or long word and then reduce the window size of the browser.  it does eventually re-layout the columns to allow for more width, but not before the long word exceeds the boundary of the column it is in.    this happens for both normal and fluid containers in with a responsive grid.    it is easy to duplicate in chrome by just going to this page and editing the text after inspecting a column element.     http:// .github.com/ /examples/hero.html      i could not post an image since i am too new to stackoverflow
