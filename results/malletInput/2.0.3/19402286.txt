Text being placed over image in Bootstrap  I'm pretty new with Bootstrap and have stumbled upon an issue:    Here's the HTML of my page:         However for some reason the text is being placed partly on the image as shown in the image below:         Why is the text being placed over the image?  I thought I gave the image 3 columns and the text 9 columns of the row so I don't see how they get into each other.
