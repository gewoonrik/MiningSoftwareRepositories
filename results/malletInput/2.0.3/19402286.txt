text being placed over image in    i'm pretty new with   and have stumbled upon an issue:    here's the html of my page:         however for some reason the text is being placed partly on the image as shown in the image below:         why is the text being placed over the image?  i thought i gave the image 3 columns and the text 9 columns of the row so i don't see how they get into each other.
