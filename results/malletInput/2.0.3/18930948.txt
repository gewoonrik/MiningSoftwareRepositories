Carousel stops auto-advance when in iOS 7 ipad (only works on fresh load)  Using Bootstrap 3, with jQuery 2.0.3, the Carousel auto-advance seems to stop working in iOS 7 after you click the Previous or Next navigation areas, or click on the image.     So basically, Bootstrap Carousel only works/auto-plays upon a fresh reload of the page.     I guess this is an iOS 7 bug?  * only did my testing on an iOS7 simulator, and not the real thing.     Anyone knows of a workaround to this problem?
