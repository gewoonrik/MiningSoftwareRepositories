carousel stops auto-advance when in ios 7 ipad (only works on fresh load)  using   3, with jquery 2.0.3, the carousel auto-advance seems to stop working in ios 7 after you click the previous or next navigation areas, or click on the image.     so basically,   carousel only works/auto-plays upon a fresh reload of the page.     i guess this is an ios 7 bug?  * only did my testing on an ios7 simulator, and not the real thing.     anyone knows of a workaround to this problem?
