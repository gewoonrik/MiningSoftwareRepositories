Can't create a Bootstrap Switch (v2.0)  I have some difficulty to use the plugin BootStrap Switch    -switch.org/  I inserted both files css and js correctly into my project but it doesn't seem to work and I have no idea why. I'm using Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap Switch 2.       Here my files loaded by BootStrapBundle which I retrieve at the top for the CSS and at the end of the page for the JS:         Try it on IE10 and Chrome... I really don't know what I am doing wrong...       EDIT    Here my jsfiddle
