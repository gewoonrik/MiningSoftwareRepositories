why chrome is displaying this simple   header in two lines?  the code below is displaying correctly in one line in both ff and ie but chrome for some reason is displaying it in two lines as if both span and button elements had "display:block;". while i see that span has indeed computed display as block (because of the "float: left" as i could read elsewhere), but button has computed display as "inline-block" so it would seem that it should be rendered next to span and not below it.    it seems to behave like this with any version of   >= 3.    can anybody tell me why does chrome behaves like?    (and i'm not asking how to place those element next to each other - i already found out that it works correctly when using ul and li elements)
