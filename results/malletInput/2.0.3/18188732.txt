Toggle active link Bootstrap navbar  I've read a lot of posts on the subject, found almost always the same solution but it does not work for me...    My problem is as follows : I want to use Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 and its navbar, so I include the css and js files. Just before that, I also include jquery. I then take an example given on the   site which display very well. However, I now want to set the menu item clicked as active and remove the active class from all others. I saw in the  .js file that this function is built in, so no more script code to include. The problem is that the menu items do never toggle to active. I then tried to add a jquery script to force removing all active classes and add the active class to the one item that was clicked. Nothing happened.    So please, help !! I tried the same code in jsfiddle and it works fine, so does the problem comes from jade ? from express layout ? how to fix it ?    Here is the code I use :     server.js
