  carousel interval false not working  i've installed    -carousel on a site and i wanted to be able to use it to step through panes of a module, however, setting interval to false is not working. if i give it an interval, it will step through just fine as scheduled, but as false i am unable to use the controls to step through the slides. i am selecting the container by id rather than $('.carousel') so i don't know if that has anything to do with it. is there another module needed that gives the interval false functionality?      a brief example of my html is:          div class="carousel" id="module-rotator"           div class="carousel-inner"               div class="item active" foo /div               div class="item" bar /div           /div           a class="carousel-control left" href="#module-rotator" data-slide="prev"  lsaquo; /a           a class="carousel-control right" href="#module-rotator" data-slide="next"  rsaquo; /a       /div       and i initialize the carousel with this:      $('#module-rotator').carousel({ interval: false });      i am using  -carousel.js v2.0.3
