Bootstrap Carousel Interval False Not working  I've installed Twitter Bootstrap-Carousel on a site and I wanted to be able to use it to step through panes of a module, however, setting interval to false is not working. If I give it an interval, it will step through just fine as scheduled, but as false I am unable to use the controls to step through the slides. I am selecting the container by ID rather than $('.carousel') so I don't know if that has anything to do with it. Is there another module needed that gives the interval false functionality?      A brief example of my html is:         I am using  -carousel.js v2.0.3
