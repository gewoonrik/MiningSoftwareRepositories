problems with including   to springmvc project via webjars  i've tried to use   in my springmvc project:  link to github repo     unfortunately, css files are not visible. the browser is throwing errors in the console like this:     get   404 (not found)     i think pom.xml has proper configuration, because i am able to view included webjars (  and jquery) in eclipse under java resources -> libraries -> maven dependencies. i've also set path in servlet-context.xml like this (last line):      !-- handles http get requests for /resources/** by efficiently serving up static resources in the ${webapproot}/resources directory --   resources mapping="/resources/**" location="/resources/" /   resources mapping="/webjars/**" location="/meta-inf/resources/webjars/"/       i think this line is correct, because tomcat no longer says that it don't know how to handle request starting with '/webjars/. all tutorials that i've found lists only these steps, and i couldn't find any useful information on the internet. i've spent whole day on this, as i am new to spring development , so any help would be hugely appreciated. thanks in advance!
