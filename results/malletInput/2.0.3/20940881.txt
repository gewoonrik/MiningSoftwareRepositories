problems with including   to springmvc project via webjars  i've tried to use   in my springmvc project:  link to github repo     unfortunately, css files are not visible. the browser is throwing errors in the console like this:         i think this line is correct, because tomcat no longer says that it don't know how to handle request starting with '/webjars/. all tutorials that i've found lists only these steps, and i couldn't find any useful information on the internet. i've spent whole day on this, as i am new to spring development , so any help would be hugely appreciated. thanks in advance!
