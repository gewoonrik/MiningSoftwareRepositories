Problems with including Bootstrap to SpringMVC project via WebJars  I've tried to use Bootstrap in my SpringMVC project:  link to GitHub repo     Unfortunately, CSS files are not visible. The browser is throwing errors in the console like this:         I think this line is correct, because Tomcat no longer says that it don't know how to handle request starting with '/webjars/. All tutorials that I've found lists only these steps, and I couldn't find any useful information on the Internet. I've spent whole day on this, as I am new to Spring development , so any help would be hugely appreciated. Thanks in advance!
