  dropdown in collapse,  i'm using   2.0.3, with drop-down menus inside divs which are collapsible / expandable. when the drop-down menu overflows the div, they get cut off (but they shouldn't). jsfiddle to illustrate:        in   2.0.2 the menu does not get cut off:        i found half a workaround by using a css rule as follows:         the 'in' css class gets added by   whenever a div marked with 'collapse' gets expanded.    unfortunately this workaround breaks completely in firefox.    any ideas? i am considering downgrading to   2.0.2, but that would be painful.
