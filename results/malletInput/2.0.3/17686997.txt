collapsible navigation twitter   not working  I have been trying to get my navigation bar to collapse however it does not work. I have read other peoples replies to the same problem on this site but I still can't get it to work. Here is my HTML:         The location of the files and the paths in the src tags are correct so I am not sure why it is not working. I have tried the website in both Chrome and Firefox.    Any ideas?    Thanks
