collapsible navigation     not working  i have been trying to get my navigation bar to collapse however it does not work. i have read other peoples replies to the same problem on this site but i still can't get it to work. here is my html:         the location of the files and the paths in the src tags are correct so i am not sure why it is not working. i have tried the website in both chrome and firefox.    any ideas?    thanks
