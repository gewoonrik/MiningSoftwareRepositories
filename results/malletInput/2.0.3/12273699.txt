how to achieve parity between     icons and font awesome icons  in a ruby on rails 3.2 app i'm using    -sass v 2.0.3 with  font awesome  both installed as gems.    i'm using 'font awesome' because i'd like to change the colors of the   icons.     my problem is that my icons are completely off in terms of alignment to eachother:           what's happening is it's rendering the original black icon and the newer one in separate locations.     on font awesome, it says "this giant set of new icons was requested on the font awesome github project and includes icon parity with   2.0.3."    how can i align the icons so the shape is the same but so i still manipulate the color through a font?
