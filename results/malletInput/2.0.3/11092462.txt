rails 3.2.3 +     + nav-tabs: how to show a specific tab?  another newbie-question regarding rails and  .    i am using something like this:      div class="tabbable tabs-left"   ul class="nav nav-tabs"       li class="active"  a href="#tab1" data-toggle="tab" about us /a  /li               li  a href="#tab9" data-toggle="tab" address /a  /li   /ul   div class="tab-content"       div class="tab-pane active" id="tab1"           %= render 'about_us' %       /div       div class="tab-pane" id="tab9"           %= render 'address' %       /div   /div           my problem is that i render 'address' which includes a form. by submitting this form i end up in an different controller. after saving a new address with this controller i would like to redirect to this page and show the address tab.    the redirect command i tried was: redirect_to salon_path(@salon.id.to_s + "#tab9") this results in calling the url  .../salons/1%23tab9. what i think i need its .../salons/1#tab9.    but maybe you are having a better solution how to choose one specific tab.    using:     gem 'rails', '3.2.3' gem ' -sass', '2.0.3'.
