Sliding Current Carousel Item in Bootstrap Modal Slider  I am trying to create a simple lightbox using Bootstrap carousel and Modal. Please  take a look at sample file which I have here .    What I would like to do is starting the Modal Carousel as same slide (current slide) of the main carousel. As you can see from the example when I start the Modal it just start from the first item but I need to start from current active slide.    Can you please let me know how to do this?
