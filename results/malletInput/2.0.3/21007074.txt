Adding search form to top navbar    I am trying to add search form to the top navbar code shown below so that it will appear just before the Logout link with a small space and aligned to the right side, but it always appear either after the logout link or it will expand the navbar and look bad.    So can someone please help me by telling me what I am missing here? Thanks for your time.    Head section:
