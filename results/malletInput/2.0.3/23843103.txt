I can't get the event from ace.min.js while using require.js in index.html  I am a new user in web developing especially using ace,backbone and require scripts. I have to create a web page as MVC/MV* structure by using backbone.js. I have successfully done that. After that I noticed require.js and try to use that. But, there is an event in one of my html template, that needs "ace.min.js". But that will not work after render that template in index.html. Following are the codes and screens of my application :-     1. index.html                 6. Page Screen with error
