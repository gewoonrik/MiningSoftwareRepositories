how do i trigger an onselect event in for an input box?  i'm using  -typeahead.js v2.0.3 to autocomplete an text input. i'm also using gravity form's dynamic population to add a value to the autocomplete text input. how can i trigger the autocomplete to look up data related to the dynamically populated value?    i've tried to add simple jquery trigger functions, with no luck.    here is a snippit of my autocomplete (typeahead) initialization:          any help would be much appreciated.    thanks y'all!
