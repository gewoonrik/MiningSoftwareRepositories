How do I trigger an onSelect event in for an input box?  I'm using  -typeahead.js v2.0.3 to autocomplete an text input. I'm also using gravity form's Dynamic Population to add a value to the autocomplete text input. How can I trigger the autocomplete to look up data related to the dynamically populated value?    I've tried to add simple jQuery trigger functions, with no luck.    Here is a snippit of my autocomplete (typeahead) initialization:          Any help would be much appreciated.    Thanks y'all!
