rake aborted couldn't find file twitter/  while deploying to heroku  i'm trying to deploy an app that works fine in development, but when I push it to heroku with $git push heroku master , the rake assets:precompile fails because  "couldn't find file twitter/ ". (error raised by application.js)     I've already googled the problem and found a huge variety of answers but none of these work for me:  Heroku deploy fails after upgrading to   2.0.1 via twitter- -rails gem      Rails app with Twitter Bootstrap works in Development, but not in Production      Rails3 couldn&#39;t find file &#39; &#39;     -i've tried to add config.assets.precompile = false    can anyone help me to figure out the problem? i can't really understand. Thank you.    here is the Gemfile
