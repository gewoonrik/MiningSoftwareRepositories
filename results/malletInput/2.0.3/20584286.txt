Internet Explorer 9. Bootstrap menu not collapsing  I am have nearly finished building a website with the twitter   framework when I started to test it on other browsers. It's looks and feels great on all browsers (If I may say so myself...) however, on IE9 and probably IE8, etc all fail to collapse the menu bar to expose the subcategories. What could be the cause of this and what could I do to fix it? Is it possible that this is being caused with JavaScript?     Thanks for your help in advance!    Please note that I have looked at similar questions within stack overflow, but they were mostly inconclusive.
