is all   javascript plugin integrate in one js file?  I just started learning   .I study the documentation of bersion 2.0.3 that i need to add  .js,  .css , if I need to implement anything I need to enter jquery and plugin from here.  http:// docs.com/v2.0.3/docs/javascript.html     But When I goes uper version 3.2 or 2.3.2    .com/2.3.2/javascript.html     .com/javascript/     there is that line return  Plugins can be included individually (though some have required dependencies), or all at once. Both  .js and  .min.js contain all plugins in a single file.     what does it mean ? if I include  .js .it will contain all plugin ? No need to add other plugin ?
