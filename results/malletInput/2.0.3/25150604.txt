is all   javascript plugin integrate in one js file?  i just started learning   .i study the documentation of bersion 2.0.3 that i need to add  .js,  .css , if i need to implement anything i need to enter jquery and plugin from here.  http:// docs.com/v2.0.3/docs/javascript.html     but when i goes uper version 3.2 or 2.3.2    .com/2.3.2/javascript.html     .com/javascript/     there is that line return  plugins can be included individually (though some have required dependencies), or all at once. both  .js and  .min.js contain all plugins in a single file.     what does it mean ? if i include  .js .it will contain all plugin ? no need to add other plugin ?
