stylesheet not loaded because mime type and file not found for node.js  i am fiddling with     using node.js and jade, however i am getting this stylesheet not loaded because mime type and file not found even though the directory is path is correct, i am speculating that i need to "set up" the route on the server side first like python's bottle framework code below    for python's bottle framework
