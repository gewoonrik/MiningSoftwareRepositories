stylesheet not loaded because mime type and file not found for node.js  i am fiddling with     using node.js and jade, however i am getting this stylesheet not loaded because mime type and file not found even though the directory is path is correct, i am speculating that i need to "set up" the route on the server side first like python's bottle framework code below    for python's bottle framework     @route('/static/js/ filename ') def js_static(filename):      return static_file(filename, root='./static/js')  @route('/static/img/ filename ') def img_static(filename):     return static_file(filename, root='./static/img')  @route('/static/css/ filename ')   def img_static(filename):     return static_file(filename, root='./static/css')      is there a node.js equivalent? or alternatively, is my set up for jade correct?    any hint would be much appreciated    jade file     !!! 5 html(lang='en') head     title title     link(rel='stylesheet', href='/static/css/ .css', type='text/css')   body     p the open items are as follows:     table.table.table-striped       tr         td "a"         td "a1"       tr         td "b"         td "b1"     script(src='/static/js/jquery-2.0.3.min.js')     script(src='/static/js/ .js')       .js is in directory     /static/js/
