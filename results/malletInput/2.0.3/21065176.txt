Bootstrap 2.3.2 styles not being found/applied  I'm trying to create a basic Hello World page in Bootstrap, but the styles in the .css file are not being applied to the content on the page. In chrome dev tools, the .js and .css files are successfully loaded and can be looked through in-browser, but the styles are not applied to the element.    html:         Is there a step that I'm missing?
