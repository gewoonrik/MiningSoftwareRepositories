ruby on rails with jquery.min.map: failed to load resource status 406  i am using a wrap   theme to style my rails 3.2 app. after including all the stylesheet files and javascript files, i see that some inline editing(which uses javascript and jquery) is not working as in the demo. i can run the sample pages on my system but after integrating with my rails application, i get the following error:        failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 406 (not acceptable)          although when i look for       in my browser(chrome), it exists. i tried hard but cant figure out what can cause this... please help.    thanks in advance!
