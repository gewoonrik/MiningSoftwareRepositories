Ruby on Rails with jquery.min.map: Failed to load resource status 406  I am using a wrap   theme to style my rails 3.2 app. After including all the stylesheet files and javascript files, I see that some inline editing(which uses javascript and Jquery) is not working as in the demo. I can run the sample pages on my system but after integrating with my rails application, I get the following error:        Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 406 (Not Acceptable)          Although when i look for       in my browser(chrome), it exists. I tried hard but cant figure out what can cause this... Please help.    Thanks in advance!
