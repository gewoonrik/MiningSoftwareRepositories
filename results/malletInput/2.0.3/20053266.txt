  modal won't show up  my   (3.0.2) modal won't show up. i've tried different buttons, links and all that but it simply won't show up. i appreciate any help!          update 1:  here's a screenshot of the warnings in the console.          update 2:  the button and the modal are located inside a container. maybe this could help on your path to a solution?
