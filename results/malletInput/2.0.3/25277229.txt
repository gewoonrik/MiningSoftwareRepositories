  ie 8 and under  i've been reading for days on ways to fix ie8 and under for  .    the site:       it works great in all other versions and all other browsers.  as soon as you hit ie8, it falls apart and reverts to a one column, mobile view.  also, am not viewing this site locally, it is on my server.
