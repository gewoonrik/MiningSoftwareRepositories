Bootstrap Menu not dropping or Collapsing  I am current building a parallax   theme. I am having trouble understanding what is preventing the menu dropping down and the menu collapsing when the screen is resized.     Has any body had this problem before? I have tried switching where the position of the style sheets, including the js files in the footer but not success. Does anybody see the problem here just form the html?
