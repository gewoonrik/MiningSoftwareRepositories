  menu not dropping or collapsing  i am current building a parallax   theme. i am having trouble understanding what is preventing the menu dropping down and the menu collapsing when the screen is resized.     has any body had this problem before? i have tried switching where the position of the style sheets, including the js files in the footer but not success. does anybody see the problem here just form the html?
