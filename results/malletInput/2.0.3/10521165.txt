Bootstrap JavaScript Carousel Doesn't Stop Cycling   Twitter Bootstrap Version:  2.0.3     Example HTML code:           CSS:  Provided with   .css      Problem:  As you can see, I've enabled  paused  mode, and disabled  cycling . But when I click the carousel's left or right controls, the carousel starts cycling at the default interval (5 seconds per cycle) on mouseleave.    How do I forcefully disable cycling? I want the images to be cycled manually by the user.     You can test the problem live on my test site  here .
