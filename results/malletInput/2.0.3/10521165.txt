  javascript carousel doesn't stop cycling       version:  2.0.3     example html code:           css:  provided with   .css      problem:  as you can see, i've enabled  paused  mode, and disabled  cycling . but when i click the carousel's left or right controls, the carousel starts cycling at the default interval (5 seconds per cycle) on mouseleave.    how do i forcefully disable cycling? i want the images to be cycled manually by the user.     you can test the problem live on my test site  here .
