  boot strap with jade template engine does not apply effect  i am trying to apply   css to my jade view, however the effect did not show up and as i inspect console, it seems like the browser cannot get the css, it listed 404 , but i am sure that the directory listing is correct, what could be the problem?     !!! 5 html(lang='en') head     title title     link(rel='stylesheet', href='/static/css/ .css', type='text/css')   body     p the open items are as follows:     table.table.table-striped       tr         td "a"         td "a1"       tr         td "b"         td "b1"     script(src='/static/js/jquery-2.0.3.min.js')     script(src='/static/js/ .js')
