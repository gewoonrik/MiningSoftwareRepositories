  3: nav dropdown not working  i am using a common menu containing a dropdown. the site is on     . the dropdown menu works perfectly for a month now and it just stopped working just a while ago. these are the thing i've tried so far:       checked the menu structure against   3 examples and it seem to have all the prerequisites.     checked for errors on firebug but found none.     pasted   example code in place of the original menu but likewise didn't work.     linked to the latest stable version of jquery at //codeorigin.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js     temporarily removed link to less.js and the drop down menus worked. i think some codes on main.less is silently causing the error as no errors appear on debugging mode.       any ideas guys? thanks.
