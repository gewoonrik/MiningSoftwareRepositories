  - default width extended slightly to the right  i'm having this strange behavior of    . i have a full-width layout which i divide a row into an 8:4 grid ratio.    now, it happens to me that there is a little bit of the width being extended to the right, causing the horizontal scroll bar to appear. the extending bit is just around 20px, but i can't seem to find where it comes from.    i tried to set any possible padding to 0px to my html and body tag, but there's no luck.    screenshot:          edit:     some code, though i'm pretty sure you will not find anything interesting, quite a basic code.     html:       body   div class="row"     div id="left-pan" class="col-md-8"       div id="control"          lorem      /div     /div     div id="right-pan" class="col-md-4"      lorem    /div   /div   script src="js/jquery-2.0.3.js"  /script   script src="js/ .min.js"  /script   script src="js/default.js"  /script   /body        css:      html, body {     background-color: darken(@slate, 10%);     font-family: 'carme', sans-serif;     width: 100%;     height: 100%; }  .row {     height: 100%; }  #left-pan {} #right-pan {}
