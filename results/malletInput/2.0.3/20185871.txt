Bootstrap - default width extended slightly to the right  I'm having this strange behavior of Twitter Bootstrap. I have a full-width layout which I divide a row into an 8:4 grid ratio.    Now, it happens to me that there is a little bit of the width being extended to the right, causing the horizontal scroll bar to appear. The extending bit is just around 20px, but I can't seem to find where it comes from.    I tried to set any possible padding to 0px to my html and body tag, but there's no luck.
