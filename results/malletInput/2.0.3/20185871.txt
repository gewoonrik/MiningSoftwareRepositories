  - default width extended slightly to the right  i'm having this strange behavior of    . i have a full-width layout which i divide a row into an 8:4 grid ratio.    now, it happens to me that there is a little bit of the width being extended to the right, causing the horizontal scroll bar to appear. the extending bit is just around 20px, but i can't seem to find where it comes from.    i tried to set any possible padding to 0px to my html and body tag, but there's no luck.    screenshot:          edit:     some code, though i'm pretty sure you will not find anything interesting, quite a basic code.     html:
