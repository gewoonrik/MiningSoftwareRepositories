  3.0 model window not working,  the following is the html produced by the mvc project, on index page, seems to be an issue with my modal form the create is a partial view but the window is not working.     is there some thing wrong with the order of the javascript loading?    i took bootswatch css insted of   css. i even replced the bootswatch css to original   css that did not make a difference also.    i also have a section in web.config.         thank you very much in advance.
