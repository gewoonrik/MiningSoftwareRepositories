Bootstrap 3.0 Model Window not working,  The following is the html produced by the mvc project, on index page, Seems to be an issue with my modal form the create is a partial view but the window is not working.     is there some thing wrong with the order of the Javascript loading?    i took bootswatch css insted of   css. i even replced the bootswatch css to original   css that did not make a difference also.    i also have a section in web.config.         Thank you very much in advance.
