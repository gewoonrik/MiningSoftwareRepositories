Twitter Bootstrap - Span Columns not displaying correctly  I am trying to get started with Twitter Bootstrap, but for some reason, anything I do, results in a div spanning the entire page. As such, I cannot get the grid system / navigation bar to look right as every div appears to have it's own line.    I am sure that this is a simple fix but I am completely baffled.
