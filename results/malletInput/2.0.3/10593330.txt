Bootstrap dropdown sub-menu not appearing correctly in tablet/phone view  I did search through the many   dropdown questions, but couldn't see any with the same specific problem as myself!    I'm having an issue with the Bootstap Dropdown Navbar sub-menu's...    I'm using the latest release of Bootstrap (v2.0.3)    Everything now appears to be working fine in standard desktop view - but when i shrink the browser width (or view on iPhone/iPad), the sub-menu's are not working correctly.    Best if you just go visit my test site at  TEST SITE     As you can see, the "Points Tables" drop down is fine in desktop view, but in 'mobile' view something is wrong. The 'pop up' does not work and the sub-menus are permanently on display.    I believe i have followed the example code exactly (other than figuring out via the 'upgrade doc' that the 'caret' needed to be implemented in a new different way to how the example shows)    Here is my current code:         I can't figure out what i have done wrong, the page started as one of their example pages, so should have all necessary code, and i have added the entire   framework to my server, even including the javascripts i won't actually be needing.    Any help would be appreciated  as i'm completely baffled by this    I only have very basic skills, so please keep it simple    Many Thanks - Ade
