  modal not blocking content below  i am using   to show a simple modal window, for some reason though the modal is not blocking any content below it, so i can still click, write and do whatever i want even when the modal shows. anyone knows how to change it so it actually blocks all other content?  that is all the code there is to this example (no js files or nothing):      html   head        link href="lib/ -2.3.2/css/ .css" rel="stylesheet" /       script src="lib/jquery-2.0.3/jquery.js"  /script       script src="lib/ -2.3.2/js/ .js"  /script    /head   body    div class="content"         div class="modal"            div class="modal-header"               h3 example title /h3           /div           div class="modal-body" example text /div           div class="modal-footer"               button class="btn" no /button               button class="btn" yes /button           /div       /div        !-- my form with fields etc is here --       label example field /label  input type="text"  /input    /div    /body   /html       here is the result:           i have   css and js files included, given the example below i can still see the text box even tho the modal is showing...
