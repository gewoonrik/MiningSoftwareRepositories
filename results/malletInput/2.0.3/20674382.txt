wrap  jquery not working with angularjs  I am using  wrap  theme - ace .    I have html page using  angularjs using yeoman, karma and grunt . There I am using the ace theme. The angularjs is working fine for me. But the wrap  theme is not working properly. Some Jquery works, but some not. Here is my  index.html  page structure.         I thought it is because the  href=#  interrupting by the  angularjs routing  so I removed the  #  from that. And it is still not working.      I removed 3 first 3 scripts imported inside    tag. So I get like following image. The top menus are working. But left menu is not able to minimize and showing JQuery error in console that  Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined .         How can I solve this?
