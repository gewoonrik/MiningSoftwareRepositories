can't get   tooltip to work in rails app  i have the following code in a partial in my rails app :        its working fine in the fiddle but i can't figure out why its not working in my app. i checked the loaded resources with web inspector in the browser and its loading  -tooltip.js. ( -tooltip.js v2.0.3). do i need a newer version? i've also tried moving the script into the application.js file and either way i'm getting the following error:
