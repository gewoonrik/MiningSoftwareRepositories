Bootstrap 3 application IE 9 rendering issue  I've developed an application with the following UI Stack      Jquery 2.0.3   Bootstrap 3   Highcharts   Jquery UI 1.10.3      No HTML 5 elements used.    Browsers on which app was successfully tested:      Chrome 31.0   Firefox 25.0   IE 10 and 11      But I've run into major rendering issues on IE9, despite it being supported by Bootstrap 3.    When I first render the application, there's no error but none of the elements display at all.    The moment I open up the Developer tools console tab(to check errors) and do a fresh request, the whole application renders completely.    In the Developer tools on IE9, the Browser mode is IE9 and Document mode is IE9 Standards.    I even tried adding  meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"  to my HTML, but to no success.    Any idea what I could be doing wrong?
