  3 application ie 9 rendering issue  i've developed an application with the following ui stack      jquery 2.0.3     3   highcharts   jquery ui 1.10.3      no html 5 elements used.    browsers on which app was successfully tested:      chrome 31.0   firefox 25.0   ie 10 and 11      but i've run into major rendering issues on ie9, despite it being supported by   3.    when i first render the application, there's no error but none of the elements display at all.    the moment i open up the developer tools console tab(to check errors) and do a fresh request, the whole application renders completely.    in the developer tools on ie9, the browser mode is ie9 and document mode is ie9 standards.    i even tried adding  meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge"  to my html, but to no success.    any idea what i could be doing wrong?
