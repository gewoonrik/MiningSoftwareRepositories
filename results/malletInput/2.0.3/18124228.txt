Nested Tabs - Twitter Bootstrap  So I am trying to develop a web page that has some nested tabs    That means I have two tabs and when I press on one of them I will be able to see two tabs.    The first level of tabs is working fine with me, however the nested tab is not. That mean you have two tab with completely different content and that is working properly.    But the issue when I press the first tab (The one that has nested tabs inside) I can see the content of both tabs directly. Although that I am setting only one of them as active.    I tried to make none of the nested tabs active which does not make any sense, however I tried and as expected it made no difference    Here is my Html page
