How to pass the image src to the   modal with javascript?  I have a while loop of images from my database. I get the src of the images using javascript. On click a modal must open with the image being clicked. My problem is that I can't pass the src of images to the modal to show the right image. As a matter of fact, I can't show any image at all. Here is my code. Thanks for the help.
