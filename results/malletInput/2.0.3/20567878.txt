  typeahead not desplaying all results  using: jquery 2.0.3,          2.3.2 (both as requested by my our client)    my typeahead code:     var type = $(".airportsearch").typeahead({     source: function(query, process) {          map = {};          $.ajax({             url: url_,             datatype: "json",             data: {                 n: 12, q: query             },             success: function(data) {                 airports = [];                  $.each(data, function (i, record) {                     map[record.airport] = record;                     airports.push(record.city + ", " + record.airport + " (" + record.iata + "), " + record.country);                 });                  console.log(airports);                  process(airports);             }         });     },     minlength: 1,     items: 12,     updater: function (item) {         selectedstate = map[item];         return item;     } });      the code seems to be working fine. i've also hit the url that the ajax hits myself, using  q=ist  which gives me this result:  ["ä°stanbul, tã¼m havalimanlarä± (ist), tã¼rkiye", "ä°stanbul, atatã¼rk havalimanä± (ist), tã¼rkiye", "ä°stanbul, sabiha gã¶kã§en havaalanä± (saw), tã¼rkiye", "ä°stankã¶y, ä°stankã¶y (kgs), yunanistan"]  (the order of the results is not always the same, but i  always  get these 4 results, which is correct according to the client)    my problem is this: the autocomplete box never shows more than 3 results. i have logged the results in the console, and even though the ajax results returns all 4, only 3 are displayed.    it also stops giving autocomplete suggestions for any string more than 3 characters, even though i know the ajax is receiving results(e.g it won't display any results for istanbul, even though it gets 3 back from the server)    can anyone please help me locate where i have made a mistake?
