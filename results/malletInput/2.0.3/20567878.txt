Bootstrap typeahead not desplaying all results  Using: JQuery 2.0.3,        Bootstrap 2.3.2 (Both as requested by my our client)    My typeahead code:      (The order of the results is not always the same, but I  always  get these 4 results, which is correct according to the client)    My problem is this: the autocomplete box never shows more than 3 results. I have logged the results in the console, and even though the ajax results returns all 4, only 3 are displayed.    It also stops giving autocomplete suggestions for any string more than 3 characters, even though I know the ajax is receiving results(e.g it won't display any results for istanbul, even though it gets 3 back from the server)    Can anyone please help me locate where I have made a mistake?
