yii   (v2.0.3) extension invalid path alias  i followed the yii-  installation instructions on    /setup.html  but the path alias set in config/main.php doesn't work for me:         it says "alias " .components. " is invalid. make sure it points to an existing directory or file. "    i tried lots of stuff but can't get it to work. any ideas?
