yii   (v2.0.3) extension invalid path alias  i followed the yii-  installation instructions on    /setup.html  but the path alias set in config/main.php doesn't work for me:      ?php // path alias for   yii::setpathofalias(' ',yii::getpathofalias(dirname(__file__).'/../extensions/ ')); // this is the main web application configuration. any writable // cwebapplication properties can be configured here. return array( ...      protected/extensions/ /... is my   directory.    if i want to use it in my layouts/main.php     yii::app()-  - register();      it says "alias " .components. " is invalid. make sure it points to an existing directory or file. "    i tried lots of stuff but can't get it to work. any ideas?
