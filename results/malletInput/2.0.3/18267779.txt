how do i switch from using the  - -rails gem to using normal    i have a rails app that was built with the   rails gem for development, but now i am going to start doing design and styling stuff and i would rather just move to referencing   normally/locally. the app is based on  the rails3- -devise-cancan template .    i tried just removing the  -sass gem and then deleting all of the stylesheets and .js files in /assets, and replacing the application.css and application.js with  .css and  .js. but when i launch the application, i can see it is grabbing certain things from  , but the formatting is wrong and a lot of interface things don't work.    what is the easiest cleanest way to make the switch?
