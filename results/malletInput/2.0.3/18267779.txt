How do I switch from using the twitter-Bootstrap-rails gem to using normal Bootstrap  I have a rails app that was built with the Bootstrap rails gem for development, but now I am going to start doing design and styling stuff and I would rather just move to referencing   normally/locally. The app is based on  the rails3- -devise-cancan template .    I tried just removing the  -sass gem and then deleting all of the stylesheets and .js files in /assets, and replacing the application.css and application.js with  .css and  .js. But when I launch the application, I can see it is grabbing certain things from  , but the formatting is wrong and a lot of interface things don't work.    What is the easiest cleanest way to make the switch?
