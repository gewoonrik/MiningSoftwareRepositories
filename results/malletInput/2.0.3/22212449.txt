Boostrap dropdown events not working with  -ui  According to    .com/javascript/#dropdowns  events (e.g., show.bs.dropdown, hide.bs.dropdown) are thrown when a drowdown is opened/closed. This works until module  -ui is active. I created a plunkr that shows the issue    . The events are thrown when the dependency to ui.boostrap is removed, that is          Versions are: Bootstrap 3.0.3, Angular 1.2.4 (also tested with 1.2.13), Angular UI Bootstrap 0.10.0, JQuery 2.0.3    Seems to be a bug in  -ui, any ideas for a workaround?
