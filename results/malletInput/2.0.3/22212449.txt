boostrap dropdown events not working with  -ui  according to    .com/javascript/#dropdowns  events (e.g., show.bs.dropdown, hide.bs.dropdown) are thrown when a drowdown is opened/closed. this works until module  -ui is active. i created a plunkr that shows the issue    . the events are thrown when the dependency to ui.boostrap is removed, that is          versions are:   3.0.3, angular 1.2.4 (also tested with 1.2.13), angular ui   0.10.0, jquery 2.0.3    seems to be a bug in  -ui, any ideas for a workaround?
