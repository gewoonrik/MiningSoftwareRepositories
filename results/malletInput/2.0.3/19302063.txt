e003 type error with   glyphicons and javafx webview  i'm have a really weird bug, heres the setup:    i have a web app running in openshift, all is good and runs great in chrome, firefox, internet explorer, safari and android webview.    but because i need some hardware level access for a few functions, i created a javafx application running a webview with a javascript interface for the hardware functions.    everything works and runs (although with low fps) except for the   3 glyphicons.     here is a screenshot from chrome:           here is a screenshot from javafx webview           the ria, client side is running:   -  3 and glyphicons (from the cdn)  -  modal (from the server)  -jquery 2.0.3 (from cdn)  -angularjs (from cdn)        update:   after some testing, it appears that glyphicons from   2.3.2 do work as expected inside javafx. but i'm not willing to go back to bs 2.3.2
