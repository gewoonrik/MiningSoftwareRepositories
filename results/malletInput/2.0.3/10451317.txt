Twitter Bootstrap Customization Best Practices  I'm working with Bootstrap 2.0.3 using LESS. I want to customize it extensively, but I want to avoid making changes to the source whenever possible as changes to the libraries are frequent. I am new to LESS so I don't know how its compilation entirely works. What are some best practices for working with LESS or LESS based frameworks?
