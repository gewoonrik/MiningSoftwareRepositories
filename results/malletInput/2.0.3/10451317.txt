    customization best practices  i'm working with   2.0.3 using less. i want to customize it extensively, but i want to avoid making changes to the source whenever possible as changes to the libraries are frequent. i am new to less so i don't know how its compilation entirely works. what are some best practices for working with less or less based frameworks?
