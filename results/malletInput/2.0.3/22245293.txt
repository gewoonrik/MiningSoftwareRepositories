Bootstrap conflict for modal and editable jQuery PHP  I am using   for my project.    Two things I want to do.      Display the book records.   On clicking on any book show a pop-up and this pop-up will have the record list which can be edited(inline edit)      I have two set of jQuery files (one is for modal window and the other one is for inline editable).          When I run both the js files seperately I see no issues. When I try to integrate the inline edit inside a modal window there is problem with the modal window close button and also with the inline edit is not working.    Is the issue related to version(version problem)    Any one have faced such problems. Can someone help me out or guide me with an example.    Thanks Kimz
