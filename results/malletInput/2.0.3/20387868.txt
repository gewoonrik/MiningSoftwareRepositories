extra files present when using a   enabled control?  i want to use  this   enabled timepicker , but i can't get the dropdown to appear when i click on the button. i'm very new to web development, so i assume i'm missing a step that is so obvious to everyone else that it isn't even mentioned in  the documentation .     this question  mentions that there are "relevant css files" that need to go in the  , and some of the other folders, but i'm not sure if these get compiled into the minified source later, or i need to somehow install them as well.
