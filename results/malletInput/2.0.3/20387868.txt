Extra files present when using a   enabled control?  I want to use  this   enabled timepicker , but I can't get the dropdown to appear when I click on the button. I'm very new to web development, so I assume I'm missing a step that is so obvious to everyone else that it isn't even mentioned in  the documentation .     This question  mentions that there are "relevant css files" that need to go in the  , and some of the other folders, but I'm not sure if these get compiled into the minified source later, or I need to somehow install them as well.
