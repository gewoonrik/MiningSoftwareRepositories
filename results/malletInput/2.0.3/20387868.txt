extra files present when using a   enabled control?  i want to use  this   enabled timepicker , but i can't get the dropdown to appear when i click on the button. i'm very new to web development, so i assume i'm missing a step that is so obvious to everyone else that it isn't even mentioned in  the documentation .     this question  mentions that there are "relevant css files" that need to go in the  css/   folder. is this true? what files are they?    so far i have done the following to install this control on my page.      html     head       meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /       link rel="stylesheet" href=" -2.3.2/css/ .css" media="screen"       link type="stylesheet" href=" -timepicker/css/ -timepicker.min.css" /       script src="jquery-2.0.3.js"  /script       script src=" -2.3.2/js/ .js"  /script       script type="text/javascript" src=" -timepicker/js/ -timepicker.min.js"  /script     /head     body       div class="input-append  -timepicker"         input id="timepicker1" type="text" class="input-small"         span class="add-on"  i class="icon-time"  /i  /span       /div        script type="text/javascript"  $('#timepicker1').timepicker(); $('#timepicker1').timepicker().on('show.timepicker', function(e) {     console.log('the time is ' + e.time.value);     console.log('the hour is ' + e.time.hour);     console.log('the minute is ' + e.time.minute);     console.log('the meridian is ' + e.time.meridian);     });      /script      /body   /html       i get the console log messages in chrome when clicking on the button that should open the dropdown, so i know it's getting the click event properly.    if i look in the   -timepicker/css  folder though, i see this file:      -responsive.css      do i need to do something with this file? there are also several other files in   -timepicker/assets ,   -timepicker/less , and some of the other folders, but i'm not sure if these get compiled into the minified source later, or i need to somehow install them as well.
