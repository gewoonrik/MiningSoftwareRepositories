Yeoman Bower including jQuery twice?  I'm using Yeoman for a simple site. When I look at the Resources pane in Chrome, I see jQuery is being included twice (which breaks some needed Bootstrap js)    Bower list outputs this:     ├─┬  #3.0.0 │ └── jquery#1.10.2 (2.0.3 available) ├── jquery#1.10.2 (latest is 2.0.3) ├── modernizr#2.6.2 ├── requirejs#2.1.8 └─┬ sass- #3.0.0   └── jquery#1.10.2     I've tried bower uninstall on  , sass- , jquery, doesn't seem to help.
