rails3, simple_form, twitter  : radio buttons break onto differnet lines  My rails 3.1.3 app is using simple_form 2.0.1 and twitter_ _rails 2.0.3.    All my form elements looks fine except when I use a radio collection         I have the "form-horizontal" class assigned to simple_form_for, and all the other form elements look fine.    Do I need a special class attached to the f.collection_radio_buttons?
