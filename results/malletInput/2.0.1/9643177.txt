rails3, simple_form,    : radio buttons break onto differnet lines  my rails 3.1.3 app is using simple_form 2.0.1 and  _ _rails 2.0.3.    all my form elements looks fine except when i use a radio collection         i have the "form-horizontal" class assigned to simple_form_for, and all the other form elements look fine.    do i need a special class attached to the f.collection_radio_buttons?
