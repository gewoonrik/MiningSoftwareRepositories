Bootstrap CSS issues in different browsers  For an unknown reason the Twitter bootsrap is displaying the scroll arrow buttons not the way it should be. Is this a known issue or something is wrong with my browsers? I have tested in different ones: Firefox 24.0 (windows os), and Chrome 31.0.1650.57 (windows os). The only one working is Chrome 22.0.1229.94 (ubuntu).    Any help is welcome.      Thanks in advance.
