rake aborted! couldn't find file twitter/   i'm following the Hartl tutorial about ROR 3.2, i build a simple app that works fine locally but when i try to deploy it to heroku wit $git push heroku master , the rake assets:precompile fails because  "couldn't find file twitter/ ". (error raised by application.js)  I've already google the problem but none of these answers work for me:  Heroku deploy fails after upgrading to   2.0.1 via twitter- -rails gem      Rails app with Twitter Bootstrap works in Development, but not in Production     can anyone help me to figure out the problem?  If i have to attach some files, or if you needother informations please tell me. Thank you    here the Gemfile
