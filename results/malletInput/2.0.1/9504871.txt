Twitter BootStrap TopBar and DropDown Menu  I am trying to build a topbar that has some links on the left and to the right, there will be a Login Link which would open the Login Form in a DropDown. I also want that the Login form should behave like a selected Tab when clicked (or when the dropdown is open)    My code looks like this :-             I've got 2 lists, one of them to the right as I wanted it to behave like tabs. My problem is that I can't remove the little arrow that points to the Login Link when the dropdown is open. I want it to look like a selected Tab with dropdown below it, without the pointing arrow.    Also, the tab looses it's rounded corners when selected. I am sure it's a CSS issue but not sure where to look for it..    Any ideas?    P.S. I am on BootStrap v2.0.1
