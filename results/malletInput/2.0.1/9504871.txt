    topbar and dropdown menu  i am trying to build a topbar that has some links on the left and to the right, there will be a login link which would open the login form in a dropdown. i also want that the login form should behave like a selected tab when clicked (or when the dropdown is open)    my code looks like this :-             i've got 2 lists, one of them to the right as i wanted it to behave like tabs. my problem is that i can't remove the little arrow that points to the login link when the dropdown is open. i want it to look like a selected tab with dropdown below it, without the pointing arrow.    also, the tab looses it's rounded corners when selected. i am sure it's a css issue but not sure where to look for it..    any ideas?    p.s. i am on   v2.0.1
