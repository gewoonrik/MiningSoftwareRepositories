simple_form +  , premature validation  my  simple_forms  are showing validation messages before the form is even submitted.    for example, right when you land on the signup page, it's as if you just tried submitting an empty form- the first_name and last_name fields are highlighted in red, with the  can't be blank  error messages next to them.    adding:     required =  true      (or false) on the simple_form has no effect.    i have validations in my user model. if i remove those model validations, the forms work as expected (adding required: true gives me properly-functioning client-side validation). however, i want to have both client-side and model validations.    does anybody have a clue as to why validations are triggered when the form is first loaded?    i'm using simple_form 2.0.1 with  -sass 2.0.1 in my rails 3.2.2 app. my user form uses the   styling ( 'form-horizontal' ), although when i remove that it still validates prematurely. also, adding  :novalidate =  true  to the form builder has no effect.    thanks!    edit: here is the new action is my doctors_controller:     def new     @doctor = doctor.new     @user = @doctor.build_user end      (user is a polymorphic association and can belong to multiple models.)    it seems like the user model is getting saved even though i'm using build_user rather than create_user.    solved    i updated my model validations to include  on: save , which solved the problem. it was validating the not-yet-saved user object.
