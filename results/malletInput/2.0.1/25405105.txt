Break a table row into multiple line (responsive layout)  I have a webpage that lists items. The default template uses a table for that, which i find very appropriate. In this table however, there is one column that contains much more text than the others:         While that works out on a large screen, it is very annoying to read on a small screen:         In order to use the available space better, I can only think of a fake-table layout using divs. I did a prototype, using   grid layout, that looks like a table row on large screens, but has a different layout on small and extra small screens:         While that improves the readability of the text by using the full width, I cannot use the utilities I've got for tables any more, and it breaks the user experience in subtle ways. For example, I use a nice script that enables sorting at the client. But that works only on real tables. Small inconsistencies between real tables and fake tables.    Is there any way that I can reformat a table row into a multi-line container similar to the one in the last image?    FYI: I am using jquery 2.1.1, Bootstrap 3.2.0.1 as GUI Framework and asp.net MVC on the server.    Bootply is here:        Edit: in case that did not come out clear enough: I want to keep the  and  and style them similar to the divs. I do not want to replace the table with divs.
