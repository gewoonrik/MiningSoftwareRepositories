break a table row into multiple line (responsive layout)  i have a webpage that lists items. the default template uses a table for that, which i find very appropriate. in this table however, there is one column that contains much more text than the others:         while that works out on a large screen, it is very annoying to read on a small screen:         in order to use the available space better, i can only think of a fake-table layout using divs. i did a prototype, using   grid layout, that looks like a table row on large screens, but has a different layout on small and extra small screens:         while that improves the readability of the text by using the full width, i cannot use the utilities i've got for tables any more, and it breaks the user experience in subtle ways. for example, i use a nice script that enables sorting at the client. but that works only on real tables. small inconsistencies between real tables and fake tables.    is there any way that i can reformat a table row into a multi-line container similar to the one in the last image?    fyi: i am using jquery 2.1.1,   3.2.0.1 as gui framework and asp.net mvc on the server.    bootply is here:        edit: in case that did not come out clear enough: i want to keep the  and  and style them similar to the divs. i do not want to replace the table with divs.
