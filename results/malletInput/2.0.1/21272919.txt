Using the Angular Seed Project Unable to Run Unit Tests   Updated     I am going through the karma modules looking for code that says chrome and trying to switch to firefox unsuccessfully, if anybody knows where I should look too I will be very happy as well.       I hope somebody is familiar with angular seed. I wrote a small angular js web app and I wanted to write some tests for it so I was learning jasmine and karma today. I found out that angular seed has these libraries installed, I spent the day moving my project to angular seed.     I am having trouble running the unit tests, I am getting the error below
