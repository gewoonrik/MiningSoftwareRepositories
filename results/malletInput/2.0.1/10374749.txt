simple_form &   validations not working  I want to setup a 'Create Account' page. The gems I'm using are:      rails (3.2.3)   simple_form (2.0.1)   omniauth-identity   twitter- -rails (2.0.6)   mongoid (2.2.3)      The form looks as follows:         If I don't fill in any of the text field of the form and then click on 'Sign Up', the form does not display any error messages from the validators, but instead redirects me to the home page!     Am I missing something obvious or could this be some problem with the gem versions I am using? I could of course implement the same form without simple_form using twitter-  markup, but would prefer it this way.
