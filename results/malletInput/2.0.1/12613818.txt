javascript animation behaves differently in updated chrome  okay, this one is  really  wierd.    currently i'm maintaining  rails 3.2.8  application and a couple of days ago i've noticed that js-animation began to behave differently in updated  chrome .    i'm using   -modal.js  and   -alerts.js  modules from   -  1.4 :    â€” when i'm trying to dismiss alert message, it fades out but the element remains in the code:      div class="alert-message block-message info fade in"   a href="#" class="close" ã— /a    lorem ipsum...  a href=" " a link /a   /div       so i have the blank space now with the size of dismissed block. and still can click that link other there (blindly).    â€” when i'm invoking   modal i'm getting only darkened background overlay, but there's no modal itself. checked the page source and it has only one new block since the moment event was triggered:      div class="modal-backdrop fade in"  /div       this happens  only  in  chrome  (tried  safari ,  firefox  â€” everything's fine) and  only  on  local machine . there's no such problem on remote server (it has identical code). i also tried to run application in production mode on local machine â€” same lacks.    and there's no errors or warnings in  chrome  console.    tried on    chrome 21.0.1180.89 m  /  22.0.1229.79 m  (windows 7)    chrome 22.0.1229.91 beta  (os x 10.6.8)    found a guy with similar problem but without answer â€”     (in case you doubt my sanity)
