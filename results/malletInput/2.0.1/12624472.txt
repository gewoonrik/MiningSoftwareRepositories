how can i remove a background tr color from a     table?  i'm using       v 2.0.1 and have given my table the table-striped class.  i'm trying to change a row color if clicked.  this works great except for every n:th row that doesn't have a stripe color.  i assume i need to remove the striped color first but my attempt is failing.  any idea what i'm missing?    html         what am i doing wrong?
