How can I remove a background tr color from a Twitter Bootstrap table?  I'm using  Twitter Bootstrap  v 2.0.1 and have given my table the table-striped class.  I'm trying to change a row color if clicked.  This works great except for every n:th row that doesn't have a stripe color.  I assume I need to remove the striped color first but my attempt is failing.  Any idea what I'm missing?    HTML         What am I doing wrong?
