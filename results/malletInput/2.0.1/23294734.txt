having trouble overriding bootsrap css for google maps api accesssed through gmaps4rails gem  i am following the gmaps4rails tutorial and trying to implement it in a   framework, but am having problems.  the map won't load correctly...   see here.   zooming in function does not work.     i tried the workaround  but it has only helped marginally.  this appears to be a problem with how   is set up, or perhaps my require tree is not correct.  see below for my relevant code.    views/layouts/application.html.erb         any help is much appreciated :)
