Having trouble overriding bootsrap css for Google Maps API accesssed through Gmaps4Rails Gem  I am following the Gmaps4Rails tutorial and trying to implement it in a   framework, but am having problems.  The map won't load correctly...   See here.   Zooming in function does not work.     I tried the workaround  but it has only helped marginally.  This appears to be a problem with how   is set up, or perhaps my require tree is not correct.  See below for my relevant code.    views/layouts/application.html.erb         Any help is much appreciated :)
