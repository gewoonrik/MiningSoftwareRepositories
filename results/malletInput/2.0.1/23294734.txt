having trouble overriding bootsrap css for google maps api accesssed through gmaps4rails gem  i am following the gmaps4rails tutorial and trying to implement it in a   framework, but am having problems.  the map won't load correctly...   see here.   zooming in function does not work.     i tried the workaround  but it has only helped marginally.  this appears to be a problem with how   is set up, or perhaps my require tree is not correct.  see below for my relevant code.    views/layouts/application.html.erb      !doctype html   html     head       title  %= full_title(yield(:title)) %  /title        %= stylesheet_link_tag "application", media: "all",                             "data-turbolinks-track" =  true %       %= javascript_include_tag "application",                                 "data-turbolinks-track" =  true %       %= csrf_meta_tags %       %= render 'layouts/shim' %       % flash.each do |key, value| %         %= content_tag(:div, value, class: "alert alert-#{key}") %       % end %     /head       ...    custom.css.scss --> this is the main stylesheet for my app, and i added the workaround code here just to see if it would make a difference, but it did not.     @import " ";  /*map*/  #map img {    max-width: none; } #map label {    width: auto; display:inline;  }       ...    application.css     ...  * you're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the  * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.  *  *= require_self  *= require_tree .  */      index.html.erb --> home page where map is displayed      head  link rel="stylesheet" href="reports.css.scss" /  /head    script src="//maps.google.com/maps/api/js?v=3.13 amp;sensor=false amp;libraries=geometry" type="text/javascript"  /script   script src='//google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerclustererplus/2.0.14/src/markerclusterer_packed.js' type='text/javascript'  /script   script src='//google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/richmarker/src/richmarker-compiled.js' type='text/javascript'  /script   ...   %= link_to 'new report', new_report_path %    div style='width: 800px;'     div id="map" style='width: 800px; height: 400px;'  /div   /div    script type="text/javascript"  handler = gmaps.build('google'); handler.buildmap({ provider: {}, internal: {id: 'map'}}, function(){   markers = handler.addmarkers( %=raw @hash.to_json % );   handler.bounds.extendwith(markers);   handler.fitmaptobounds(); });      reports.css.scss --> the name of my model is reports, as opposed to 'user' in the gmaps4rails demo     // place all the styles related to the reports controller here. // they will automatically be included in application.css. // you can use sass (scss) here:   img {    max-width: none; } #map label {    width: auto; display:inline;  }       application.js     //= require jquery //= require jquery_ujs //= require   //= require turbolinks //= require underscore //= require gmaps/google //= require_tree .      any help is much appreciated :)
