Remove/Uninstall old version of ruby gem  I updated a gem whilst I had the rails server running and now I have 2 versions of the gem installed in my gemset.     I updated using  .    The server seems to be serving up the 2.0.1 version so I assume it should have removed the 2.0.1 version when it did the update and didn't because the gem was in use at the time.    Can someone tell me how to either update it properly so that the server will use 2.0.2 instead of 2.0.1 or how to remove the 2.0.1 version of the gem.
