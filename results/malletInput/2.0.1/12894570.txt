Twitter Bootstrap Modal scrolling the page up on show  Clicking on a link which triggers a Twitter Bootstrap Modal to pop up is causing the browser to scroll up the page.  This behavior is only occurring in Chrome.    Here is a demonstration page:           The page has 600 rows of links, causing the page body to exceed window height. If any of these links is clicked, it displays the modal dialog.  When in Chrome, clicking any of the links below the initial view will cause the background page to scroll up (not always entirely to the top).    I am use the following function to trigger the display of the Modal:         Now, if the  Launch Demo Modal  button is clicked, the page will scroll up when the modal is shown.    Again, this is using Chrome.
