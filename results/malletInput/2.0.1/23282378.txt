Google Maps API View and populate issues with Gmaps4rails Gem in Rails 4  I am trying to follow  this tutorial here  to add a new scaffold to my app.  In the video, the model was called User but my model is called Reports.  I have made it to 4:14 but the map is not loading properly;  see here for screenshot.  It does not zoom in, only shows blue.  When I drag it one way or the other, it turns gray.       I have followed along with the tutorial at this point precisely, but I am wondering if perhaps the scaffold is incompatible with my other models?  OR, is the   CSS template messing up the view of this map.      The problems are twofold--the view is not loading correctly, and the reports are not populating on the map.  I have pasted some of my source code below, let me know if you would like to see other files and thanks much for your help!
