google maps api view and populate issues with gmaps4rails gem in rails 4  i am trying to follow  this tutorial here  to add a new scaffold to my app.  in the video, the model was called user but my model is called reports.  i have made it to 4:14 but the map is not loading properly;  see here for screenshot.  it does not zoom in, only shows blue.  when i drag it one way or the other, it turns gray.       i have followed along with the tutorial at this point precisely, but i am wondering if perhaps the scaffold is incompatible with my other models?  or, is the   css template messing up the view of this map.      the problems are twofold--the view is not loading correctly, and the reports are not populating on the map.  i have pasted some of my source code below, let me know if you would like to see other files and thanks much for your help!
