Play 2.0.1 custom field constructor... Extra parameters?  I am new to the play framework and want to write my own twitter   field constructor, which includes the usage of the    icon-classes . To make this dynamic I need to pass the icon-class via extra parameter. Is that even possible? I tried the following and some other variations:     index.scala.html          How can I pass other arguments if that doesn't work?
