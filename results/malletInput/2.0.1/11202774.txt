play 2.0.1 custom field constructor... extra parameters?  i am new to the play framework and want to write my own     field constructor, which includes the usage of the    icon-classes . to make this dynamic i need to pass the icon-class via extra parameter. is that even possible? i tried the following and some other variations:     index.scala.html          how can i pass other arguments if that doesn't work?
