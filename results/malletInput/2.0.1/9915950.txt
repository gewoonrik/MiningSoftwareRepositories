 -sass: undefined variable: "$baselineheight"  i've integrated   into my app using  -sass.  the app works fine on my local machine, but when i go to deploy via capistrano, i get this error:     undefined variable: "$baselineheight". (in /var/www/collegesportsbluebook/shared/bundle/ruby/1.9.1/gems/ -sass-2.0.1/vendor/assets/stylesheets/ /_accordion.scss)      when the capistrano attempts to run  assets:precompile     i think this variable is throwing the error because it is the first variable in the first scss file that is attempted to be precompiled.    something isn't loading up right.  any ideas what it might be?     edit     full trace here         edit 2     added application.rb and production.rb to gist
