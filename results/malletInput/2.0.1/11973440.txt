form in condensed tablerow increasing row height  i noticed that after using a form in a tabledata-element of a condensed table that the rowheight is getting increased.    refer to following screenshot of a table that contains a form (for the delete button) and a table without form:    .    how could i get rid of this extra space that gets added when using a form? i'd like to maintain the rowheight of a condensed table.    table with only the tabledata containing the form looks like this:      table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed"           thead               tr                   th  /th               /tr           /thead           tbody               tr                   td                      @form(routes.clubs.deleteclub(club.clubid.get), 'onsubmit -  "return confirm('bent u zeker dat u dit club wilt verwijderen?')") {                         @if(!permissions.contains(clubs.club_delete) || club.isused){                              a disabled="disabled" type="submit" class="btn"  i class="icon-remove"  /i  /a                          }else{                              a type="submit" class="btn"  i class="icon-remove"  /i  /a                          }                     }                  /td                  /tr          }       /tbody       /table       i'm using     v2.0.1.    thanks!
