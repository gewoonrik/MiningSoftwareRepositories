Form in condensed tablerow increasing row height  I noticed that after using a form in a tabledata-element of a condensed table that the rowheight is getting increased.    Refer to following screenshot of a table that contains a form (for the delete button) and a table without form:    .    How could I get rid of this extra space that gets added when using a form? I'd like to maintain the rowheight of a condensed table.    Table with only the tabledata containing the form looks like this:         I'm using Twitter Bootstrap v2.0.1.    Thanks!
