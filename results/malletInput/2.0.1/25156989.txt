" -sass" doesn't load javascript on production  i am using   -sass  gem for rails  3.2.12  application.    in the gemfile is following:     gem 'jquery-rails' gem ' -sass', '~  3.2.0.1' gem 'sprockets-rails', '=2.0.0.backport1' gem 'sprockets', '=2.2.2.backport2'      on the localhost the   javascript seems to be working, but when i deploy it on the server, it doesn't (  css works well though).     application.css.scss      /*  *= require_self  *= require_tree .  */ @import " -sprockets"; @import " "; @import "font-awesome";       application.js      //= require jquery //= require jquery_ujs //= require rails.validations //= require  -sprockets //= require_tree .      any ideas why it doesn't work on production?    thank you
