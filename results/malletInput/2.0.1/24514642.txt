Using Gmaps4Rails: Failed to execute 'write' on 'Document' error  So, I must admit I'm a newbie to rails, so I fear I might be missing something extremely obvious, but I keep getting error messages with the Gmaps4Rails gem. Looking around, I can't find this problem anywhere so I think I've forgotten something so fundamentally important that no-one else seems to have this issue.     I know I'm close because whenever I refresh the page the whole thing magically works, so, I know its an issue of timing. I'm also using Bootstrap, if that helps.    The error message I keep getting is:    Failed to execute 'write' on 'Document': It isn't possible to write into a document from an asynchronously-loaded external script unless it is explicitly opened.     View Code:          So, some of the things I have tried, have included:      Including 'callback=initialize' into the google maps api script, and subsequently calling onload after the page has loaded.   Putting the scripts in just about every place you could imagine      And a fair few others from around the internet, but none of them work, sigh. Please advise.
