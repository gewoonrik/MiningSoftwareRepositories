using gmaps4rails: failed to execute 'write' on 'document' error  so, i must admit i'm a newbie to rails, so i fear i might be missing something extremely obvious, but i keep getting error messages with the gmaps4rails gem. looking around, i can't find this problem anywhere so i think i've forgotten something so fundamentally important that no-one else seems to have this issue.     i know i'm close because whenever i refresh the page the whole thing magically works, so, i know its an issue of timing. i'm also using  , if that helps.    the error message i keep getting is:    failed to execute 'write' on 'document': it isn't possible to write into a document from an asynchronously-loaded external script unless it is explicitly opened.     view code:          so, some of the things i have tried, have included:      including 'callback=initialize' into the google maps api script, and subsequently calling onload after the page has loaded.   putting the scripts in just about every place you could imagine      and a fair few others from around the internet, but none of them work, sigh. please advise.
