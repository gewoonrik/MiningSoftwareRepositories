adding popover data-content inside html page,      i use     2.0.1. i have such a button:      a class="btn btn-info" rel="popover"   title="today 12:11"   data-content="i'm the content of the button 1 heyoo" last text /a   a class="btn btn-info" rel="popover"   title="yesterday 10:20"   data-content="i'm the content of the button 2 heyoo" last text /a       but when i use this code, search engines doesn't take "data-content" into account. but i want "data-content" to be seen by spiders.    if i make this, button becomes to big:      a class="btn btn-info" rel="popover"   title="today 12:11" i'm the content of the button 1 heyoo /a       this is also alternative, but creates duplicate data:      a class="btn btn-info" rel="popover"   title="today 12:11"   data-content="i'm the content of the button 1 heyoo"    last text   div style="display: none;"    span i'm the content of the button 1 heyoo /span    /div   /a       another alternative is putting "data-content" into page but writing it with font 1 point. but i don't think that's a good idea.
