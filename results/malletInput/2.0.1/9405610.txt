How to change navbar collapse threshold using Twitter  -responsive?  I'm using Twitter Bootstrap 2.0.1 in a Rails 3.1.2 project, implemented with  -sass. I'm loading both the   Javascript.    I have a fluid layout with a navbar similar to the  example . This follows the navbar "responsive variation" instructions  here .  It works fine: if the page is narrower than about 940px, the navbar collapses and displays a "button" that I can click on to expand.    However my navbar looks good down to about 550px wide, i.e. it doesn't need to be collapsed unless the screen is very narrow.    How do I tell Bootstrap to only collapse the navbar if the screen is less than 550px wide?    Note that at this point I do  not  want to modify the other responsive behaviors, e.g. stacking elements instead of displaying them side by side.
