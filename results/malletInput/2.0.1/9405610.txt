how to change navbar collapse threshold using    -responsive?  i'm using     2.0.1 in a rails 3.1.2 project, implemented with  -sass. i'm loading both the   javascript.    i have a fluid layout with a navbar similar to the  example . this follows the navbar "responsive variation" instructions  here .  it works fine: if the page is narrower than about 940px, the navbar collapses and displays a "button" that i can click on to expand.    however my navbar looks good down to about 550px wide, i.e. it doesn't need to be collapsed unless the screen is very narrow.    how do i tell   to only collapse the navbar if the screen is less than 550px wide?    note that at this point i do  not  want to modify the other responsive behaviors, e.g. stacking elements instead of displaying them side by side.
