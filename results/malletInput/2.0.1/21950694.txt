Why does Twitter Bootstrap Carousel stop after first switch?  I am trying to create a Carousel with Twitter Bootstrap but I get the error below, referencing to line 388 of  .js, after the first switch/slide of the Carousel.        Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'slice' of undefined      I am using the Chromium browser on Ubuntu, Version 32.0.1700.102 Ubuntu 12.10.    Here is the HTML I am using. It is pretty much a copy from    .com/javascript/#carousel              Here is the  JSFiddle  to the HTML above.    Could someone please let me know what am I doing wrong?
