are two copies of  .css supposed to be generated by compass when using  -sass?  i am trying to set up a ruby web project using  sinatra  (1.4.5),  slim  (2.0.3),  sass  (3.4.0) and   -sass  (3.2.0.1) gems.    since i am using sass, i decided to try out the  compass  (1.0.1) gem to automatically generate   desirable? if not, how can i get compass to stop generating 2 copies?
