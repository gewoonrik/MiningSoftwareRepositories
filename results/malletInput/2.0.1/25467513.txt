Are two copies of  .css supposed to be generated by Compass when using  -sass?  I am trying to set up a ruby web project using  sinatra  (1.4.5),  slim  (2.0.3),  sass  (3.4.0) and   -sass  (3.2.0.1) gems.    Since I am using Sass, I decided to try out the  compass  (1.0.1) gem to automatically generate   desirable? If not, how can I get compass to stop generating 2 copies?
