Trouble using  _form gem - couldn't find file 'rails_ _forms' error  I'm trying to use the  _form ~> 2.0.1 gem (see    -ruby/rails- -forms ) but it's giving me fits. I've installed is as per the instructions on their github page, adding it to my Gemfile:         But, when I try to run my app I get:        couldn't find file 'rails_ _forms' (in /path/to/my/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss:12)      I'm obviously missing something. I checked lib/assets/ and vendor/assets/stylesheets/ but there's nothing there. Likewise, there's nothing in app/assets/stylesheets/.    What the fudge?
