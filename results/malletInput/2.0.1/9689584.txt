buttons run together in   2.0.1  i'm using   2.0.1, and in my pages i often have a couple of buttons next to each other:      a class="btn btn-primary btn-large x-create-quiz" create quiz /a   a class="btn x-cancel" cancel /a  /div       the buttons render next to each other, with no spacing between them.    i've had to add a   nbsp;  between the two.    looking at the source of the     documention, they do the same thing, but get a small space between the buttons.    any idea why?  i'd prefer to eliminate the  .  could there be some enclosing   div   somewhere that provides the gap?    i've gotten the same results in chrome and firefox.
