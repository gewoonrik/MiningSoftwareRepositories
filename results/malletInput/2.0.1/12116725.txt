executing functions before   popover is displayed?  i've recently started using  's new   2.0.1 and its javascript popovers.     i want to write a script so that no more than one popover can be displayed at one time. in other words, when a new popover is generated for whatever reason (e.g. the client clicks or hovers over a new element with a popover), all of the previously displayed popovers are hidden first.    here's the function that initially sets up all of the popovers for my webpage:         but my problem is figuring out where (or how) to call this hidepopovers function. i want to call it when a popover is triggered, but before the popover is displayed. help?    oh, and just to clear up any confusion, the new   now has a 'click' trigger that allows you to display popovers upon clicking.  more details about it can be found here .    thank you so much!
