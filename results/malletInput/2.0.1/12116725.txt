Executing functions BEFORE Bootstrap popover is displayed?  I've recently started using Twitter's new Bootstrap 2.0.1 and its Javascript popovers.     I want to write a script so that no more than one popover can be displayed at one time. In other words, when a new popover is generated for whatever reason (e.g. the client clicks or hovers over a new element with a popover), all of the PREVIOUSLY displayed popovers are hidden first.    Here's the function that initially sets up all of the popovers for my webpage:         But my problem is figuring out WHERE (or HOW) to call this hidePopovers function. I want to call it when a popover is triggered, but before the popover is displayed. Help?    Oh, and just to clear up any confusion, the new Bootstrap now has a 'click' trigger that allows you to display popovers upon clicking.  More details about it can be found here .    Thank you so much!
