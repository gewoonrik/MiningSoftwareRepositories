link_to renders incorrectly after moving to  -sass from blueprint  May seem related to  Switching from Blueprint to Twitter Bootstrap  but that didn't fix my issue.    I have cleaned up all blueprint references, cleared cache   temp, gems ( -sass and jquery) are installed, and restarted the server.    All my link_to statements render with the reference next to my text. Also my bulleted menu content stands vertical as opposed to being horizontal.     This is the code from my pre-compiled layouts.css.scss that should make my header menu lie flat and more to the right.    Help.
