link_to renders incorrectly after moving to  -sass from blueprint  may seem related to  switching from blueprint to      but that didn't fix my issue.    i have cleaned up all blueprint references, cleared cache   temp, gems ( -sass and jquery) are installed, and restarted the server.    all my link_to statements render with the reference next to my text. also my bulleted menu content stands vertical as opposed to being horizontal.     this is the code from my pre-compiled layouts.css.scss that should make my header menu lie flat and more to the right.    help.
