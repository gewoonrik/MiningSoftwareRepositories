search box in header using      i am trying to place a search text box on the right hand side of the header and i can't seem to figure out how to do it using   2.0.1. the code i am trying is         but it the search text box is not being pushed to the right with the spans and offsets and the line on the bottom of the header is not being pushed to the bottom of the  tag.  any ideas?
