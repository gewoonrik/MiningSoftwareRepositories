    form inline stretch  i've got a inline form with   2.0.1 - this form has 3 labels and 3 dropdowns...    what i am trying to do is stretch the dropdowns in a way that the first one is to the left and the third one is to the right of the containing div....i can do this via some float left and right but i was wondering if there is something like this built-in already?    thoughts?    the code looks like this
