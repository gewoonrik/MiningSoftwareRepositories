    drop down suddenly not working  i was wondering if someone could help me. my   drop down menu suddenly stopped working. i have no idea why. it was working before. i didn't touch my views my layouts views so i think the problem is not there. im pretty sure it has to do with my javascript but i dont know where its coming from.    my gem file is...     gem 'rails', '3.2.3' gem ' -sass', '2.0.1' gem 'bcrypt-ruby', '3.0.1' gem 'faker', '1.0.1' gem 'will_paginate', '3.0.3' gem ' -will_paginate', '0.0.5' gem 'devise' gem 'carrierwave' gem 'rmagick' gem 'delayed_job_active_record' gem 'daemons' gem 'make_voteable' gem 'admin_data' gem 'indextank'      and my application.js is...     //= require jquery //= require jquery-ui //= require jquery_ujs //= require  -dropdown //= require   //= require_tree .      im guessing maybe it has to do with my config files somehow?
