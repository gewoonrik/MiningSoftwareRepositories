twitter   .hidden-lg less not working       I decided to change div class="promo-pod" to div class="span4 hidden-lg" and it hid the div, but when it is just div class="promo-pod", all the rules apply except the .hidden-lg;    The less file compiles correctly each time I save the file, any help is appreciated.    Changed the name to promo, as in , very long, so search for promo in this gist
