  3: missing gutters  just started playing around with   3 and i can't get gutters between columns to work.    i created the most basic code to test with:      !doctype html   html lang="en"   head       title test /title       script src=" "  /script       script src="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.0-rc1/js/ .min.js"                                                                                                                                    /script       link href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.0-rc1/css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" /       style          .box1 {             background-color: green;         }         .box2 {             background-color: blue;         }      /style   /head   div class="container"       div class="row"           div class="col-lg-4 box1"               h1 test /h1           /div           div class="col-lg-8 box2"               h1 test2 /h1           /div       /div   /div   /html       and the result is just one big green/blue box without any gutter in between the two columns. i have also tried it on a fiddle with no luck     what am i missing?
