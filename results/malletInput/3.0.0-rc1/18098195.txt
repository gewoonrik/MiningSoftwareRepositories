  3: how to scale a centered image  i have the following html/css page that successfully centers an image file in the exact middle  of a   3 page:      tag, but it pushes the image to the right for some reason, and then kind of scales in a hurky-jerky kind of way.    is there a way to set up the code above so that the image will rescale as the browsre window resizes?
