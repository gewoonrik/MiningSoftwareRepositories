   3 carousel not working?  i seem to be having problems with  's carousel. the last time i implemented one was when i was using   2.xx. ripping from the 2.xx example code pages worked fine. but when i do the same, the carousel does not seem to work. doesn't slide, nothing. i have included   3 cdn and the paths work. i have also included jquery at the bottom of the page, the one they gave with the code, that is also still a live link.  any solutions/advice is highly appreciated.    thankyou
