  mobile nav gets cut off by window shade when applying roll over  I am using the Modern Business   theme:    .com/templates/modern-business/  and when I apply the CSS code to have the main menu do rollover menus:         In mobile view the bottom menu gets cut off by the 'navbar-collapse' container. I have tried going through all of the CSS code multiple times using z-index and position but nothing is changing. Does anyone know how to make the drop down menu appear above the parent container. The flip side to this when I use this CSS (   cdn.com/ /3.0.0-rc1/css/ .css ) it works fine but I cannot find the specific place where the code is different from the CSS I am using (   .com/templates/modern-business/css/ .css ), I mean I know it is different but the nav tags are all pretty similar.
