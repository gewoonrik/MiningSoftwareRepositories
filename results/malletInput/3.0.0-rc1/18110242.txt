Bootstrap 3 Carousel won't work. (Yes, I have jQuery loaded before Bootstrap)  I'm converting an application to Bootstrap 3.  Here's the code to my sample carousel page, in its entirety.  Yes, I have jQuery loaded before the Bootstrap.js gets loaded.  For whatever reason, the carousel simply will not work.  Specifically: the previous/next buttons don't work and the carousel doesn't automatically slide to the next slide.    Tested against:      Safari 6.0.5   Chrome 28.0.1500.95   Firefox 23.0      ...on Mac OS X 10.8.4         Anyone have an insight on why this is not working?
