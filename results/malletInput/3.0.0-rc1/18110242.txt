  3 carousel won't work. (yes, i have jquery loaded before  )  i'm converting an application to   3.  here's the code to my sample carousel page, in its entirety.  yes, i have jquery loaded before the  .js gets loaded.  for whatever reason, the carousel simply will not work.  specifically: the previous/next buttons don't work and the carousel doesn't automatically slide to the next slide.    tested against:      safari 6.0.5   chrome 28.0.1500.95   firefox 23.0      ...on mac os x 10.8.4         anyone have an insight on why this is not working?
