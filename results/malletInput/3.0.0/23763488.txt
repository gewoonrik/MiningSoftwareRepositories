How can I do to show up a confirmation modal from   validation js file?  I'm having a hard time here. Let me explain.    I have a form and a js validation. If validation is ok a confirmation modal appears to submit (or not) some info to the database:         So is submitHandler function the one that is not letting me submit the form because after checking validation and after modal appears, if clicking in modal's submit button then it does AGAIN the validation and post never gets to the function in the controller.    So my question now is how can I do to avoid this second validation and to submit the form? I'm burned right now
