Bootstrap 3 vertical menu example as used in the documentation - resizing issue  I am trying to use Bootstrap 3 vertical scrollspy, however I cannot find any examples included in the source.    I went ahead and stripped out the documentation pages from here    .com/javascript/  but I am getting some very strange resize bugs with the sidebar - specifically:       On page refresh the nav bar is positioned and works OK, but on page resize it can drop off past the footer, or disapear before the end of the content.     When refreshed and the browser view port shows the footer (and not the content), the side nav bar shows in the footer whereas is should stop and be aligned with the end of the content.     If the browser window is maximized, clicking on the navigation items does not scroll to the corresponding header element.       Video demo of my issues are here         Pastebin post here  and code below:
