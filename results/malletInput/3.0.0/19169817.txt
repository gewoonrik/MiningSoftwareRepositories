Bootstrap 3.0 responsive change and links  I have a portion of a page in columns of 5 that is Bootstrap responsive.  Each of those 5 sections is split up into 2 columns.  The idea is that when the container responds to be smaller, each of the 5 columns stack on top of each other, and the 2 columns stack on each other:         That works fine.  My issue is that when it's horizontal, my links work, but once it becomes responsive and stacks, the links are no longer there.  Or, put more clearly, the text is there, according to Chrome's element selector, it's there, but I can't click on the link anymore.  This JSFiddle     displays the issue I'm having.
