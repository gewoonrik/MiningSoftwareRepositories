Carousel stops after last slide and doesn't cycle  I am making a site for a client and using   to build a carousel. I'm using Bootstrap 3.0 for this. I looked on here for a similar situation to mine, but the two similar cases I found have no answers to them.    Here's the url:        Everything is working fine, except in the js there must be something stopping the carousel from cycling when it hits the last slide. Pretty sure this is a simple fix but I'm not too great at js yet.     Thanks in advance and let me know if you need any code!    EDIT:    Honestly the only thing I changed from the original   js was the interval
