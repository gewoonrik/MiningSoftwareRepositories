carousel stops after last slide and doesn't cycle  i am making a site for a client and using   to build a carousel. i'm using   3.0 for this. i looked on here for a similar situation to mine, but the two similar cases i found have no answers to them.    here's the url:        everything is working fine, except in the js there must be something stopping the carousel from cycling when it hits the last slide. pretty sure this is a simple fix but i'm not too great at js yet.     thanks in advance and let me know if you need any code!    edit:    honestly the only thing i changed from the original   js was the interval     carousel.defaults = { interval: 7000,  pause: 'hover', wrap: true }      here's the code for the markup:      div id="main-slider" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel"         !-- wrapper for slides --         div class="carousel-inner"           div class="item active span12"             div class="slider-imagery fadein fadein-3s fadein-delay-3s"               img src="  /img/slider-1.png" width="100%" /             /div           /div           div class="item span12"             div class="slider-imagery fadein fadein-3s fadein-delay-3s"               img src="  /img/slider-2.png" width="100%"/             /div           /div         /div          !-- controls --         a class="left carousel-control" href="#main-slider" data-slide="prev"           span class="icon-prev"  /span         /a         a class="right carousel-control" href="#main-slider" data-slide="next"           span class="icon-next"  /span         /a      /div
