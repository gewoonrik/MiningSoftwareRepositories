carousel stops after last slide and doesn't cycle  i am making a site for a client and using   to build a carousel. i'm using   3.0 for this. i looked on here for a similar situation to mine, but the two similar cases i found have no answers to them.    here's the url:        everything is working fine, except in the js there must be something stopping the carousel from cycling when it hits the last slide. pretty sure this is a simple fix but i'm not too great at js yet.     thanks in advance and let me know if you need any code!    edit:    honestly the only thing i changed from the original   js was the interval
