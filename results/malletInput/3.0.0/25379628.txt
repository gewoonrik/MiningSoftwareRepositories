Responsive horizontal navigation on hover jumps and underline the container  I have a  responsive  horizontal menu created using Bootstrap, ul and li. The items in the menu should always stretch as the viewport changes.    Fiddle here:        Problems:      On hover, I need the links to get bolder  WITHOUT JUMPING .   On hover, I need the links to underline, but  only the text, not the whole container .   The circles between   li >s should always be in the middle between   li >s. As if they r on the place of right border.      HTML:
