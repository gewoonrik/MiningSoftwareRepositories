angularjs ng-click broken by {{$index}}  i'm having an issue with angularjs where when i use $index it breaks the ng-click function.    this is being done within a div that uses ng-repeat, the repeat code works correctly...      a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse"  data-parent="#acc{{$index}}" ng-click="sayhi('{{ $index }}');"  href="javascript:void(0);"  test  /a       when i click, it does nothing.  i check the generated html and it does have ng-click="sayhi('0')", but the click event doesn't work.    alternatively, if i change the ng-click to be:     ng-click="sayhi('0');"       without using {{$index}} to generate the zero, it works perfectly...    i've tried with angular 1.0.6 and 1.2.0    also, i'm using jquery 1.7 and   3.0 if that makes a difference.    has anyone run into this?  if so, what am i doing wrong?
