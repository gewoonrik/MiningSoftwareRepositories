AngularJS ng-click broken by {{$index}}  I'm having an issue with AngularJS where when I use $index it breaks the ng-click function.    This is being done within a div that uses ng-repeat, the repeat code works correctly...         without using {{$index}} to generate the zero, it works perfectly...    I've tried with angular 1.0.6 and 1.2.0    Also, I'm using jQuery 1.7 and   3.0 if that makes a difference.    Has anyone run into this?  If so, what am I doing wrong?
