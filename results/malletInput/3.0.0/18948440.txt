when navigating to #id, element is hidden under fixed position header  i have a   3.0 navbar with that is always visible at the top of the page, but this could represent anything for which the  position  property is  fixed .      nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-fixed-top"        because fixing it takes it out of the document flow, i need to add some padding to the body element so the content isn't hidden when the page is first display     body {     padding-top: 70px; }      the problem is that when i click a menu item to navigate to a section, like  #about  then the top of the section is cut off.     jsfiddle      q:  is there a way to adding padding so that the full item will come into view when navigated to?
