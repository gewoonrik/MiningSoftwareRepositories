  css editing  i just recently installed   3.0 onto my site and have been playing around with. i've got a couple questions regarding it;    i want to change certain specifications for the jumbotron (and other classes) in my own .css file. i have a file called "mycss.css" and have added the following code into it     .jumbotron {     background-image: url();     padding: 30px;     margin-bottom: 30px;     font-size: 21px;     font-weight: 200;     line-height: 2.1428571435;     color: inherit;     background-color: #eeeeee; }      in my index.htm i have declared my .css as follows (after the  .min.css declaration);      link href="css/my.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen"       however, these changes are not being reflected on my site. is there anything else i need to change?
