Bootstrap dropdown menu works only once  This has got to be something simple, but I cannot figure out how to correct it. I am using the Bootstrap 3 dropdown menu CSS and JS.    The problem: I click the dropdown menu, it works. I select a link from the dropdown menu and when it takes me to that page, the dropdown menu does not work on that page.    The dropdown menu only works for 1 time.    HTML in application.html.erb:
