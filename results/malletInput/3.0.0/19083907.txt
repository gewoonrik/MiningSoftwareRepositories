  dropdown menu works only once  this has got to be something simple, but i cannot figure out how to correct it. i am using the   3 dropdown menu css and js.    the problem: i click the dropdown menu, it works. i select a link from the dropdown menu and when it takes me to that page, the dropdown menu does not work on that page.    the dropdown menu only works for 1 time.    html in application.html.erb:
