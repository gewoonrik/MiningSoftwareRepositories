backstretch blank bottom bar on mobile scroll  so i am using backstretch jquery plugin for my website and so far it's working great. the only problem i see is that on mobile vertical screens a blank white bar appears on the bottom when i start scrolling down - right after the top url and bottom browser menus shrink/disappear. it looks like the background in the body tag doesn't register that it needs to resize when the top and bottom browser bars disappear. any idea on how to fix this? i'm using boostrap 3.0 and was having some issues with a white bar on the vertical scroll bar but i was able to fix that with overflow-x:hidden. any ideas would be greatly appreciated. the website is located at     - you can see the problem on the about     and contact     pages.    here's the css i have for the body and container divs:
