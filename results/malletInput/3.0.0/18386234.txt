is there a solution for using asp.net mvc 5 html.editorfor() and   3.0?   question:     is there a way to make the asp.net mvc 5 html.editorfor() form helpers work with the changed    3 form syntax .*?     discussion  (of what i have looked into already):    it appears there are a many so questions regarding hacks to override the built in mvc helpers. in general, it doesn't look like there is a supported solution to modify the helper html. (please correct me if i'm wrong)    therefore, is it possible to build a shim css file that adapts the helper's 2.3.x html to the look of the   3 form css? it seems that most other aspects of mvc 5 are   3 compatible except for the auto form fields.    the benefit of a css shim, is that it could be removed when asp.net mvc is updated to support the newer   syntax natively.    *i acknowledge that asp.net mvc 5 is still in beta and has been developed for   2.3.x since 3.0 was also in beta at the time.
