Is there a solution for using ASP.NET MVC 5 Html.EditorFor() and Bootstrap 3.0?   Question:     Is there a way to make the ASP.NET MVC 5 Html.EditorFor() form helpers work with the changed  Bootstrap 3 form syntax .*?     Discussion  (of what I have looked into already):    It appears there are a many SO questions regarding hacks to override the built in MVC helpers. In general, it doesn't look like there is a supported solution to modify the helper HTML. (please correct me if I'm wrong)    Therefore, is it possible to build a shim CSS file that adapts the Helper's 2.3.x HTML to the look of the Bootstrap 3 form CSS? It seems that most other aspects of MVC 5 are Bootstrap 3 compatible except for the auto form fields.    The benefit of a CSS shim, is that it could be removed when ASP.NET MVC is updated to support the newer Bootstrap syntax natively.    *I acknowledge that ASP.NET MVC 5 is still in beta and has been developed for Bootstrap 2.3.x since 3.0 was also in beta at the time.
