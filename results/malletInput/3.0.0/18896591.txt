Make Bootstrap 3.0 NavBar content always collapsed  I need to make a section of a NavBar of Bootstrap 3.0 always collapsed.    Actual sections of the navbar:      Links   Search Form   Login Form      When I open the website in a phone I see the three sections collapsed and I have three icons to collapse each of this content.    When I open the page in a PC i see the three sections in the bar visibles (not the buttons to collapse). What I need? In PC view only hide the Login form and show the button to collapse that login form. No matter the resolution i need to have the login button always visible and the section collapsed. This is my actual code:
