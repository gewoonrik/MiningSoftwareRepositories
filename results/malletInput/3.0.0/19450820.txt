  datepicker from eternicode not selecting date  i'm working on this input right now using   3.0 and  -datepicker from eternicode.     the problem is that i'm having by default the input to be disabled, because i do not want the user to be modifying the date by his hand.    i'm assigning an input addon with a glyphicon of a calendar to show the datepicker. the problem though is that whenever i select a date, the input doesn't receive the date. i've been going through the docs and there's a way to do it, but it is with   2.3.2 only.     here is my code, does anybody know how can i transfer the selected date from the datepicker into my disabled input?    help will be much appreciated!     html       div class="form-group"        label class="control-label" for="fechatandas" fecha /label         div class="input-group"        span class="input-group-addon date" id="trigger-datepicker"  span class="glyphicon glyphicon-calendar"  /span  /span      input type="text" class="form-control" name="fechatandas" disabled="disabled" id="fechatandas" placeholder="seleccione una fecha"    /div        js      //js to trigger the datepicker $('#trigger-datepicker').datepicker({      format: "yyyy/mm/dd",     language: "es"     });      this is the link to eternicodes datepicker plugin:       -datepicker
