getting rid of white space below footer  i'm using the   3.0 framework and no matter what i do i cannot get the little white space after the footer to disappear.it only shows in chrome though, in ie it's fine.    i've used  min-height, overflow:hidden,different margins  still nothing.           i'm sure there is some simple fix that eludes me.however it is driving me mad.    can anyone offer a solution to this?
