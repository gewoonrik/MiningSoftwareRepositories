how to use  3 theme with yiistrap extension in yii framework (  version 2)  i am using an admin theme in my backend which uses   3.0 css (used as main layout). while i have the yiistrap extension installed which uses   2 css files(for my grids and other widgets), now if i use both at the same time, every thing breaks (usually theme), it is obviously because both versions are used, and one overrides the css of another.    i need to know if there is a way where i can differentiate both css, or render one after another is some way? or would i have to make my own template/theme using yiistrap files?    let me give you an example, i have theme layout in my main.php (layout), all theme files added on this file, next, i render my user/admin view, which contains a gridview of yiistrap, now as you can see my problem, both css files are needed to render everything correctly, hance lies my problem. i want to add both files at the same time, but not to conflict with each other. does yii provide a solution for this? becuase this can happen to any theme i use, not only  .
