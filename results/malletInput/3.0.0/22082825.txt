data-binding using ko into a text box  so, i'm trying to place a knockout data-binding attribute to my text box- which is using  s 3.0.0 class with no luck.    any suggestions?         thank you in advance for an suggestions!     note  i know the data-bind works because i can see the correct data displayed when the data-binding attribute is removed from the input tag.
