input-group controls resize within nested rows in ie9 and     3  i've got a problem with this piece of code in ie9:             the problem appears when the mouse hovers over the input group buttons on the right. the input controls are suddenly increase their size. on the other hand, when you click on inputs, the size resets to normal. i've tested this code in ie10 and there is no such a problem. so, the question is is this a bug or maybe the layout is wrong and causes the problem. if it's a bug then is there any work around?
