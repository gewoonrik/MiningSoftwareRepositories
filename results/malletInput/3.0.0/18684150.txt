Bootstrap 3.0 responsive css for large element classes  I would like to have all input and button elements to appear normal size for   767px screens. If it is a > 767px screen though I need the .btn-lg and .input-lg classes be applied to all buttons and inputs. This allows for an easier touch experience on larger screens. How can this be done? Can it be done with purely CSS??
