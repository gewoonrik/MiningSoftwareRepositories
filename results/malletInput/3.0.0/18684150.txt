  3.0 responsive css for large element classes  i would like to have all input and button elements to appear normal size for   767px screens. if it is a > 767px screen though i need the .btn-lg and .input-lg classes be applied to all buttons and inputs. this allows for an easier touch experience on larger screens. how can this be done? can it be done with purely css??
