  3.0.0 switch off responsive whilst being able to use the grid system  this is a tricky one. i have built a website using   and its brilliant. brilliant for mobile/tablets. when it comes to desktop that's where the problem kicks in.    when the browser size is eg. 1000px (width of the body) then the site looks how it should. when the browser window is resized and is smaller, once it passes the sizes for tablet eg767px then the layout changes to make everything responsive.     is there a way to keep the layout of the website exactly the same no matter what the window size, whilst being able to use  s grid system?
