Bootstrap 3.0 textinput is shorter in chrome compare to firefox  I am using Bootstrap 3.0    Why is it in chrome the width of textinput is shorter compare to the firefox.    Here's the screenshot.     This is for Chrome        This is for Firefox       As you can see the Firefox has a longer textinput. Basically, I am not sure if what's the problem with this one, is it Firefox or Chrome? but overall, I wanted to follow Firefox's style(longer textinput).    This is the HTML:         Any help will be greatly appreciated! Thank You!
