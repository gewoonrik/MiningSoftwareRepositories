change   3.0 navbar default resize to custom resize  i am trying to make a dynamic mobile website which adjusts depending on screen size.    here is what the navbar does at the moment:    at 766px width:      768px width:      990px width:      992px width:      i basically want to cut out the 768 - 990px stage as it doesn't look very good!    i have inspected the element and found this code in the   default css this appears at the screen width of 768px:
