  3 - grid with fixed wrapper - prevent columns from stacking up  as the title says i'm trying to use   3 grid system with a fixed wrapper. but when i resize the browser the columns stack up even if the wrapper stays the same size?    btw: i'm using version 3 so that i can move to a responsive layout after i have ported the site. (which is huge and i'm alone, so step by step is the only option ...)
