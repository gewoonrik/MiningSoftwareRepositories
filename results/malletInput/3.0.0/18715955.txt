Bootstrap 3 - grid with fixed wrapper - Prevent columns from stacking up  As the title says I'm trying to use Bootstrap 3 grid system with a fixed wrapper. But when I resize the Browser the columns stack up even if the wrapper stays the same size?    BTW: I'm using version 3 so that I can move to a responsive layout after I have ported the site. (Which is huge and I'm alone, so step by step is the only option ...)
