Why did Bootstrap 3 switch to box-sizing: border-box?  I'm migrating my Bootstrap themes from v2.3.2 to v3.0.0 and one thing I noticed is that a lot of dimensions are calculated differently, due to the following styles in  .css.         Can anyone explain why Bootstrap switches the box-sizing of all elements to border-box? I suspect it has to do with the new grid system being percent-based, but the selector above does not only apply to the grid elements obviously.    Seems a bit radical imho :-)    Anyone care to give some insight?
