  glyphicons without changing fonts  i am using  s glyphicons, including them like this:       !-- load   css (flatly) and javascript --   link rel="stylesheet" href="  .min.css"   script src="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.1.1/js/ .min.js"  /script   link href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.0/css/ -glyphicons.css" rel="stylesheet"       before i loaded the glyphicons css file my fonts were fine. i did not set the font, instead using whatever   or jquery sets the font by default.    now i have included that glyphicon css file, my fonts have changed. can i utilize the glyphicons whilst ignoring the fonts?
