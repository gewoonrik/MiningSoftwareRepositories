  and leaflet performance issues in google docs?  is there any reason why a google docs would be a bad idea for hosting an html with   and leaflet? i've been scouring the web, but not quite connecting the dots...    locally -- leaflet loads fine -- but   (particularly the .container class) is not working out for me...    in google docs --   (particularly the .container class) is running, but leaflet is not. firebug returns a major error saying that 'jquery is not defined' (really?). if you want to see the 8 error page --  here it is .    i have a hunch this all has to do with my calls -- which are:          !--   core javascript ================================================== --     !--   core css --   link rel="stylesheet" href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.0/css/ .min.css"/    !-- custom styles for this template --   link href="viewer.css" rel="stylesheet"  href="leafquickcss.css" /    !-- leaflet css --   link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href=" " /     !-- html5 shim and respond.js ie8 support of html5 elements and media queries --   !--[if lt ie 9]     script src="../../assets/js/html5shiv.js"  /script     script src="../../assets/js/respond.min.js"  /script   ![endif]--     !-- javascript --   !-- include jquery first!!! --   script src=" "  /script   script src=" "  /script   script src="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.0/js/ .min.js"  /script
