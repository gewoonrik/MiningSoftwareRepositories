angularjs service to create   3.0 popup same as jquery mobile popup  i would like a   3.0, angularjs service that provides similar functionality as jquery mobile's popup.      i suppose what i am looking for is a modeless dialog.      the popup should allow me to place a form as content and ideally support transitions in/out.    i would like it to support triggers on pre-open, opened, pre-closed and closed events.    a usecase that i would love to be able to support is to be able to drag a field value from an active popup down to an existing field on the parent element then closing on the drop event.       ideally i would like it to be as simple as the $modal service (leverage it if possible) in which i can pass in the content and some configuration parameters.      i should be able to click out to close, or enforce a modal like behaviour.       like $modal, there will only ever be a single popup active.    just like in jqm,  i would need to support positioning of the popup anywhere within the page.     can i get this all from just the  -ui $modal service or some of this functionality? if so can you show me how.
