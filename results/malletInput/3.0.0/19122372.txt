AngularJS Service to create BootStrap 3.0 Popup same as JQuery Mobile Popup  I would like a BootStrap 3.0, AngularJS service that provides similar functionality as JQuery Mobile's Popup.      I suppose what I am looking for is a Modeless dialog.      The Popup should allow me to place a form as content and ideally support transitions in/out.    I would like it to support triggers on pre-open, opened, pre-closed and closed events.    A usecase that I would love to be able to support is to be able to drag a field value from an active Popup down to an existing field on the parent element then closing on the drop event.       Ideally I would like it to be as simple as the $Modal service (leverage it if possible) in which I can pass in the content and some configuration parameters.      I should be able to click out to close, or enforce a Modal like behaviour.       Like $modal, there will only ever be a single popup active.    Just like in JQM,  I would need to support positioning of the popup anywhere within the page.     Can I get this all from just the  -ui $Modal service or some of this functionality? If so can you show me how.
