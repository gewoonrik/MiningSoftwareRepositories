Bootstrap 3.0 Removing Double Tap on Dropdowns  I'm moving from Bootstrap 2.3 to Bootstrap 3.0 and want to remove the double tap functionality from the li elements in a dropdown in a navbar.      So for example:         In the above I don't want to have to double tap to select the Action line link.      I have tried restructuring my anchors, but it appears to be tied to the class name.  I suspect I will have to modify the   js file, and this isn't an issue.  Just can't figure out which I have to edit.      Does anyone know if this will be possible?
