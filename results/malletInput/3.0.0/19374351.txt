  3.0 removing double tap on dropdowns  i'm moving from   2.3 to   3.0 and want to remove the double tap functionality from the li elements in a dropdown in a navbar.      so for example:         in the above i don't want to have to double tap to select the action line link.      i have tried restructuring my anchors, but it appears to be tied to the class name.  i suspect i will have to modify the   js file, and this isn't an issue.  just can't figure out which i have to edit.      does anyone know if this will be possible?
