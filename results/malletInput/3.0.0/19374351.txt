  3.0 removing double tap on dropdowns  i'm moving from   2.3 to   3.0 and want to remove the double tap functionality from the li elements in a dropdown in a navbar.      so for example:      ul class="nav navbar-nav"     li class="active"  a href="#" link /a  /li     li  a href="#" link /a  /li     li class="dropdown"       a href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" dropdown  b class="caret"  /b  /a       ul class="dropdown-menu"         li  a href="#" action /a  /li         li  a href="#" another action /a  /li         li  a href="#" something else here /a  /li         li  a href="#" separated link /a  /li         li  a href="#" one more separated link /a  /li       /ul     /li   /ul       in the above i don't want to have to double tap to select the action line link.      i have tried restructuring my anchors, but it appears to be tied to the class name.  i suspect i will have to modify the   js file, and this isn't an issue.  just can't figure out which i have to edit.      does anyone know if this will be possible?
