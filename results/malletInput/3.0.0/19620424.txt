Bootstrap Popover Reinitialization (To refresh Content)  So i managed to find a way to do what i want, but I'm not sure it's exactly the smartest and most efficient way....    What I'm currently doing is using a popover to show whether or not the user has met the password conditions to set a password. Because there are 5 fields, i decided it would be easier to create it in a hidden html (using the hide class), and then use JQuerys  , Then call this function whenever i want to update the popover's content.    I was wondering if this is the most efficient way of updating the content of a   3.0 popover, that has been created from JavaScript...?
