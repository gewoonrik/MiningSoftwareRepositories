  popover reinitialization (to refresh content)  so i managed to find a way to do what i want, but i'm not sure it's exactly the smartest and most efficient way....    what i'm currently doing is using a popover to show whether or not the user has met the password conditions to set a password. because there are 5 fields, i decided it would be easier to create it in a hidden html (using the hide class), and then use jquerys  , then call this function whenever i want to update the popover's content.    i was wondering if this is the most efficient way of updating the content of a   3.0 popover, that has been created from javascript...?
