Bootstrap Carousel Not Scaling, Ends up squishing images, Same Height  Bootstrap Carousel Images are squishing with the same height.  They are not scaling properly.  I have searched and tried several solutions, however, they have not solved my problem.  Here is my html.      I tried adding adding links to several different css files.  I also tried adding several links to different js files.  I tried to change the height from 500px to auto.  I tried changing min-width 100% to width 100%.      I am using Bootstrap 3.0, however most of the solutions refer to earlier versions.  The solutions that referred to 3.0 did not work.  I just started learning BS.  I have a good working knowledge of html and css.  I believe that this has to do with js, but I cannot figure out my specific issue.  Thank you in advance for any help.
