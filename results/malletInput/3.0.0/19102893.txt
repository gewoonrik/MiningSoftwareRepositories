horizontal scroll bar displays on website even after css reset  i have superfluous/erroneous width on my website even after a css reset that displays the horizontal scroll bar. i am using boostrap 3.0 and can't seem to find any broken html, notice too it is on every page of the website. i tried a "heavy" css reset and that didn't even fix the issue.     this is the website .
