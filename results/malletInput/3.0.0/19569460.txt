  3 remote modal appears to do nothing  i found i can include my modal markup in the body of my  index.php  and load it via this line without any problems:      a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal-add" add /a       assuming, of course, that there's a div somewhere in that page called  #modal-add . when i moved that out to its own file ( modal-add.html ) and try this:      a data-toggle="modal" href="modal-add.html" data-target="#modal-add" add /a       ...i can't see that anything is happening. chrome's developer tools don't register any activity when i click the link. i've created a basic fiddle to demonstrate:        according to the docs (   .com/javascript/#modals ) that should just work, right? where am i going wrong? (i'm referencing the   js and css files from netdna, and jquery from their site, and everything else on my site is behaving normally, minus this.)     edit     since it appears that fiddle has a built-in cross-domain request, here's a bare-bones setup that anyone with a wamp server can try:    modal.html:      !doctype html   html lang="en"       head           link rel="stylesheet" href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.0/css/ .min.css"       /head       body           p  a href="modaltest.html" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#modal" click here /a  /p           script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery.js"  /script           script src="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.0/js/ .min.js"  /script       /body   /html       modaltest.html:      div id="modal" class="modal fade" role="dialog"       div class="modal-dialog"           div class="modal-content"               div class="modal-header"                   button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal"  times; /button                   h4 class="modal-title" add new designation /h4               /div               div class="modal-body"                   form                       fieldset                           div class="form-group"                               label for="add-designation" designation description: /label                               input type="text" name="add-designation" id="add-designation" class="form-control" /                           /div                       /fieldset                   /form               /div               div class="modal-footer"                   button type="button" class="btn btn-default" id="resetdesignation" reset /button                   button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" id="adddesignation" add designation /button               /div           /div       /div   /div
