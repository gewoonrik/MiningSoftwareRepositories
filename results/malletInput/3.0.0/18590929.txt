Setting the width of a dropdown list in Bootstrap 3.0  How can I set the width of a dropdown triggering button in   3.0 to be equal to the width of the dropdown list? Similar to what is achieved when using  -select (   -select/ ). I have tried to wrap the whole list in a div with a col-* class, but that doesn't seem to work:             Thus, I would like: button width = dropdown menu list = col-* width.
