pin   col-md-2 div to the top  i am trying to have my   3.0 layout pin the content of the right column to the top, thus staying in place as the main content scrolls on.  i have arrived at the following code, which blows up as i re-size the browser.  is there a way to do this?         i am not really (engineer learning these techniques) a   or css guy, so if   doesn't support this - that is valuable information for me as well.
