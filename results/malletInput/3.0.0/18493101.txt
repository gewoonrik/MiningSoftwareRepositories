  3.0 and font awesome  i have been using   and font awesome for a while now with no problems. it seems that when i changed over to   3 the font awesome icons are no longer showing up in ie10 and firefox. but it works fine in chrome and safari.    i have the same icons in a project i did in rc1/rc2 and that still works fine. anyone know what happened?
