Bootstrap3 Typeahead - Calling a function in 'Remote'  I upgraded to Bootstrap version 3.0 and I do see that the typeahead module does not exist. I am using web services and I had used the following method to call my function and populate my dataset. However, with the twitter typeahead.js, how do I call my function or how do I still use the old typeahead module? Your help is much appreciated. Thanks.
