  3.0 input type of file in an input group  with   3.x i can create a form with an input field type of "file" as shown in the   documentation:      form role="form"     div class="form-group"       label for="exampleinputfile" file input /label       input type="file" id="exampleinputfile"     /div   form       however, i can't figure out a way to put the "file" input field within an input group so the input field is on the left and the browse button on the right, all inline.  something like the following just places the above inside a text box with the browse button to the left of the input field:      div class="row"       div class="col-lg-12"           div class="input-group"               input type="file" class="form-control"           /div       /div   /div       i suspect i can't use the standard   css to do put a file input field inline, but thought i would ask.
