  3 responsive classes change display property  when upgrading my project from   2.3 to   3.0 i noticed that adding a responsive class, e.g.  hidden-sm  to an element, changes its css display property to  block .    to make things worse, the new display property is set as  !important , making it difficult (or at least ugly) to overwrite by custom css rules.    for example, the code (view result here:    )      h1    heading    small sub-heading /small   /h1       gives a different result than the code (view result here:    )      h1    heading    small class="hidden-sm" sub-heading /small   /h1       namely adding a line-break between the heading and the sub-heading.    of course, this strange behavior also applies to much more complicated cases, making it very hard for me to upgrade my project without major markup and css changes just to compensate for this new   behavior.    what did the   team try to accomplish by changing the  display  behavior of those elements? and is there an easy workaround to restore the behavior known from   2.3 and earlier?
