  3 affix header for table?  i am working with   3.0 and angularjs 1.2.      i have a large table, and above the table i have a row with controls for filtering the data in the table.  i am trying to use the "affix" feature of bs3 to stick this row to the top of the screen on scroll. i must be missing something in this instance, because although i've successfully used affix on side navs, this row will not fix.    the header is      as the page is scrolled.    what am i missing here?
