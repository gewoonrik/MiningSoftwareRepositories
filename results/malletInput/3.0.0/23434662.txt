  3 affix header for table?  i am working with   3.0 and angularjs 1.2.      i have a large table, and above the table i have a row with controls for filtering the data in the table.  i am trying to use the "affix" feature of bs3 to stick this row to the top of the screen on scroll. i must be missing something in this instance, because although i've successfully used affix on side navs, this row will not fix.    the header is      !-- table controls --   div class="row affix-top" data-spy="affix" data-offset-top="15" id="data-grid-header"  ... columns...   /div       and, following a tutorial i found, i have also added to the  body  tag:      body ng-cloak class="design-system" ng-class="{'fixed-header': settings.isfixed}" data-spy="scroll" data-target="#data-grid-header"       the relevant parts being the  data-spy  and  data-target  attributes. the body tag is in the root app document and the datagrid and other content are loaded as angular views, if that matters here.    anyway, no matter what i have tried, the class in the row does not toggle from  affix-top  to  affix  as the page is scrolled.    what am i missing here?
