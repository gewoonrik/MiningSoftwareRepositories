jquery is not defined      i am getting this error that says jquery is not defined. i want to use     and jquery-ui. in my   head   i've added the css and js necessary. i noticed that the jquery-ui page uses 1.9.1 jquery and the latest version is 1.10.2. so i'm assuming there is some sort of conflict going on.     requires jquery so that might be causing the error. or perhaps i am doing something wrong.    head:      head       meta charset="utf-8" /       link rel="stylesheet" href="  cdn.com/ /3.0.0/css/ .min.css" /       link rel="stylesheet" href="  cdn.com/ /3.0.0/css/ -theme.min.css" /       link rel="stylesheet" href=" " /       script src="  cdn.com/ /3.0.0/js/ .min.js"  /script       script src=" "  /script       script src=" "  /script       script src=" "  /script    /head       error:     uncaught referenceerror: jquery is not defined           .min.js:6 (anonymous function)                                     .min.js:6
