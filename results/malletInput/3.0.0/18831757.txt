Bootstrap 3 dropdown in navbar immediately hides after toggle - show  As demonstrated in this jsFiddle, I've a nav bar with 2 dropdowns. A link in the first drop down fires a JS click event where I manually show the second drop down. It works, except that after being shown, the second drop down automatically and immediately hides. I've added an alert to give you time to see the second dropdown before it hides.           Copy/paste of the JsFiddle code:              In case you wonder why I'm doing that: In our application the DropDown2 shows a login form. Sometimes, clicking the menu link in the DropDown1 should make the login form appear.    jQuery 1.9.1 - Bootstrap 3.0.0 Happens on both Chrome and Firefox.    I'm a Bootstrap newbie, and I'm convinced that I'm doing it wrong. Many thanks for your help. John.
