why does this javascript line contain just the function name and the function call?  i'm reading the source code for the      tabs plugin  and there's a line that appears to be short hand for something, but i don't understand what it is. here's a snippet from the source (version 3.0.0):      operator.    i'm guessing this is short hand. what is it and what is it meant to do? and how does it work?
