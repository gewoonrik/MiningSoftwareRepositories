why does this javascript line contain just the function name and the function call?  i'm reading the source code for the      tabs plugin  and there's a line that appears to be short hand for something, but i don't understand what it is. here's a snippet from the source (version 3.0.0):     tab.prototype.activate = function (element, container, callback) { var $active    = container.find('  .active') var transition = callback      $.support.transition      $active.hasclass('fade')  function next() {   $active     .removeclass('active')     .find('  .dropdown-menu   .active')     .removeclass('active')    // some code removed for conciseness    callback    callback() }      the line in question is this:  callback    callback() .    i've never seen a function or variable name just typed out like that and then a function being called after the      operator.    i'm guessing this is short hand. what is it and what is it meant to do? and how does it work?
