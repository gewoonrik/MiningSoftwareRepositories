Why does this Javascript line contain just the function name and the function call?  I'm reading the source code for the  Twitter Bootstrap Tabs Plugin  and there's a line that appears to be short hand for something, but I don't understand what it is. Here's a snippet from the source (version 3.0.0):      operator.    I'm guessing this is short hand. What is it and what is it meant to do? And how does it work?
