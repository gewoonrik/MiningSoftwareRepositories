    3 horizontal scrolling issue  building a portfolio site with tb v3.0.0 and encountered a horizontal scrolling issue that i can't seem to figure out.    trying to achieve a full bleed for the images on mobile devices so i striped the left/right padding, but horizontal scrolling occurs. here's the css i added that's causing the problem:     @media (max-width: 767px) {     .container {          padding-right: 0;          padding-left: 0;          margin-right: auto;          margin-left: auto;     } }      here's the staging site i'm working off of:
