  tooltip causing screen to jump on ipad  so i am using the knockout- .js lib to assist with   tooltip initialization when using knockout.js to apply tooltips to some ko binded html elements.          i am using trigger: 'click' instead of hover because hover tooltips do not hide themselves again once display using an ipad. when i tap a tooltip icon the tooltip shows fine but if the page is scrolled it jumps back to the top. i am not sure what direction to take with this issue.    i am currently using   3.0 but had the same issue with boostrap 2.3 thanks!
