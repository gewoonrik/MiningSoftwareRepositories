Bootstrap tooltip causing screen to jump on iPad  So I am using the knockout- .js lib to assist with   tooltip initialization when using Knockout.js to apply tooltips to some KO binded HTML elements.          I am using trigger: 'click' instead of hover because hover tooltips do not hide themselves again once display using an iPad. When I tap a tooltip icon the tooltip shows fine but if the page is scrolled it jumps back to the top. I am not sure what direction to take with this issue.    I am currently using Bootstrap 3.0 but had the same issue with Boostrap 2.3 Thanks!
