  3 support for smaller tablets  i am unable to find any reasons why   3.0 lumps phones and smaller tablets (with  768 resolution) together in their grid system.       .com/css/#grid     a group between phones(xs) and tablets(sm) could provide a better ux on even more devices.    are there any good reasons to not add a 5th group?
