    (3.0.0) dropdown & prototypejs  i have an application that i'm slowly working to convert to jquery   was going to use   as well.    however when using   3, after clicking the drop down, the menu displays correctly.  however after click off the menu or "closing" the menu.  the button/link completely disappear and doesn't reappear until page refresh.    same as this:    /issues/8379     the above link says to contact the google group, but i haven't seen anything requests regarding this in the group.    any help would be greatly appreciated!    thanks, -david    so using @geeknum88's guidance, if you comment out these lines, the dropdown works, not sure the total effects of it yet:
