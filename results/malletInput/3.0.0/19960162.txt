Bootstrap 3 modal fires and causes page to shift to the left momentarily / browser scroll bar problems  I am working on        If you click Login at the top (or sign up now anywhere on the page) it fires a standard   3.0 modal window.     You'll notice when the modal window opens, the browser scroll bar just disappears for a split second, then comes back. It does the same when you close it.    How can I make it so that it just open and closes with no browser scroll bar interaction. I have seen posts on stack where people were having problems, but I can't find an answer specific to my problem, so if someone else has made this request and someone knows about it and wants to link me to it, I'd appreciate it. I've searched for about 2 hours for this before posting up.
