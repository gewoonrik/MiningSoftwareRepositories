Layout messed up after upgrading from Bootstrap 2 to Bootstrap 3  I just updated my project from TB2 to TB3 and I'm using this   -datetimepicker  for picking date/times.    As you can see on that site, the calendar pops up if you click in the input field of it. This is how it used to work for me as wel before the upgrade. Now it looks like this:         The calendar is by default popped up, and the date's are still clickable but the input field does not get filled when you're done clicking the date and time. Even the   too for it to work.    If anyone could help me out with my messed up layout, I'd really appreciate it!
