Navigation items not collapsing into menu with Twitter Bootstrap  I'm very new to Bootstrap and I'm currently working on a navigation bar. When I make the window narrow, the navigation links collapse and the button for the drop-down appears. When I click the button, nothing happens--no menu of the collapsed links (home/about, etc). I've double checked to make sure the css files and js files are all properly called. It's odd because I'm going line-by-line from the navbar-static-top page example. Comparatively, my code looks exactly the same save for the submenu nav links.     Here's what I have:         Edit: I got it working in jsFiddle:     Still doesn't work on my actual page--still can't figure out why
