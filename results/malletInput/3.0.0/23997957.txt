  3.0 grid responsivity inside div  i looked around on the internet, but found no satisfying answer. i am new to using the   3 grid, which i enjoy a lot. however, for an animation on a page i am creating, i would like to shrink a row to some small width and while this animation plays, i want the   grid to do its work on this div instead of on the entire viewport. does anyone know a way to do this? i found the following suggestion by someone who was also wondering about this:       grid system responisve utility in resizable divs     however, i would prefer a css solution for this.
