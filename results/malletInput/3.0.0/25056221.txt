different   behaviour on localhost and development server environment  i'm working with modals of   3.0.0 and jquery 1.10.1.    at some point of my website i need to show a form inside a modal, and i want that form to be like a form wizard. to do so i use a  formtowizard pluggin  (well, it is not a plugin but it is what i need).    i call it as follows, so it works on initially loaded forms, and also on forms inside modals.         this  works perfectly fine in localhost , however in production environment (i use heroku) it doesn't.    using chrome's inspector i noticed some things:       first, when i open the modal for the first time the event is triggered, so a breakpoint in the 3rd line of my excerpt above stops the execution.  i can go step by step until the form is transformed into what i want . however, while returning from inner functions, i see that at some point (inside jquery) it gets stuck (like in an infinite loop).    i imagine that without going step by step, this would occur asynchronously and the error would come before the     second, when instead of going step by step, i open the modal for the first time, and  resume the execution, the form is not transformed . the weird part is that opening the modal a second time no longer stops in the breakpoint.        why is this working differently on production?  since it is a front-end library i thought i should work the same way.    updated    as requested, i duplicated my app, and remove the login system to provide an example of the error.  here it is .    there, both buttons show the same form. the one displayed as a modal doesn't convert the form into a wizard (and doesn't display the slider properly either). the form displayed at full view works as it should.    if you use the inspector, you'll notice the issues i explained before.    thanks for your help!
