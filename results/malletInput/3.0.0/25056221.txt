Different   behaviour on localhost and development server environment  I'm working with modals of   3.0.0 and jQuery 1.10.1.    At some point of my website I need to show a form inside a modal, and I want that form to be like a form wizard. To do so I use a  formToWizard pluggin  (well, it is not a plugin but it is what I need).    I call it as follows, so it works on initially loaded forms, and also on forms inside modals.         This  works perfectly fine in localhost , however in production environment (I use Heroku) it doesn't.    Using Chrome's inspector I noticed some things:       First, when I open the modal for the first time the event is triggered, so a breakpoint in the 3rd line of my excerpt above stops the execution.  I can go step by step until the form is transformed into what I want . However, while returning from inner functions, I see that at some point (inside jquery) it gets stuck (like in an infinite loop).    I imagine that without going step by step, this would occur asynchronously and the error would come before the     Second, when instead of going step by step, I open the modal for the first time, and  resume the execution, the form is not transformed . The weird part is that opening the modal a second time no longer stops in the breakpoint.        Why is this working differently on production?  Since it is a front-end library I thought I should work the same way.    UPDATED    As requested, I duplicated my app, and remove the login system to provide an example of the error.  Here it is .    There, both buttons show the same form. The one displayed as a modal doesn't convert the form into a wizard (and doesn't display the slider properly either). The form displayed at full view works as it should.    If you use the inspector, you'll notice the issues I explained before.    Thanks for your help!
