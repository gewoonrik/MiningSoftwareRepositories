yeoman bower including jquery twice?  i'm using yeoman for a simple site. when i look at the resources pane in chrome, i see jquery is being included twice (which breaks some needed   js)    bower list outputs this:     ├─┬  #3.0.0 │ └── jquery#1.10.2 (2.0.3 available) ├── jquery#1.10.2 (latest is 2.0.3) ├── modernizr#2.6.2 ├── requirejs#2.1.8 └─┬ sass- #3.0.0   └── jquery#1.10.2     i've tried bower uninstall on  , sass- , jquery, doesn't seem to help.
