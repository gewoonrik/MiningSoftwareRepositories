  3.0 text is coming after 2 input elements when it is coded before.  with   3.0, i am have a couple of questions/issues:    1) for learning, how is possible to have the div with class col-sm-5 small than the child div elements that are specified longer with class="col-sm-4" + class="col-sm-4" which equals 8?    2) i want "pick a date" text to come before the 2 input elements. however, it's coming after them which makes no sense to me.      form name="datefrom"       div class="form-group well col-sm-5"           div class="form-group"               pick a date              div class="col-sm-4"                   input type="text" class="form-control datepicker" placeholder="from date" name="search" class="form-control"               /div               div class="col-sm-4"                   input type="text" class="form-control datepicker" placeholder="to date" name="search1" class="form-control"               /div           /div  !-- /input-group --       /div  !-- /.col-lg- --   /form
