Bootstrap 3.0 Text is coming after 2 input elements when it is coded before.  With Bootstrap 3.0, I am have a couple of questions/issues:    1) For learning, how is possible to have the div with class col-sm-5 small than the child div elements that are specified longer with class="col-sm-4" + class="col-sm-4" which equals 8?    2) I want "Pick A Date" text to come before the 2 input elements. However, it's coming after them which makes no sense to me.
