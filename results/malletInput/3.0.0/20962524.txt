  3.0 affix doesn't work when body has overflow-x:hidden  i don't know why but when you have the css style  overflow-x:hidden  on the body element then the affix plugin does not work. it simply refuses to switch between affix, affix-top and affix bottom.    i'm guessing it fails to detect or measure the scroll position but i have no idea why  overflow-x:hidden  could be causing this.    unfortunately i need  overflow-x:hidden  so removing it is not a good work-around.    any ideas on how/where to look?
