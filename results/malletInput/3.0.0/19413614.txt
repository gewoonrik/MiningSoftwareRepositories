viewport size, huge whitespace new on responsive site  i am working on an existing fixed-width desktop site, and the client wants no changes to the existing desktop layout whatsoever, and they want it to be "responsive".    the problem:    when viewed on a phone (my android, anyhow), the 'mobile' site loads as expected.  however, if you touch, move, scroll, etc, or happen to "zoom out", there is a huge amount of whitespace like this:          background:    for the record: the new specs for the "mobile" view contains some new content, new menu options, etc., which don't always correlate consistently with the existing content.    so, my approach has been to add a css class to elements i want to keep, then use jquery.clone(), .append(), and appendto() to re-use as much of the existing content as possible, moving elements into my new "mobile scaffold":     $('.mobile-header').appendto($('#ph_mobile_header')); $('.mobile-content').appendto($('#ph_mobile_content')); $('.mobile-footer').appendto($('#ph_mobile_footer'));      the simplified scaffold:      div id= "ph_mobile_wrapper" class="mobile-wrapper mobile visible-xs"       div class="row row-offcanvas row-offcanvas-left"           div id="main" class= "col-xs-12"             div id="ph_mobile_header" class="visible-xs"               !-- header --             /div             div id="ph_mobile_content" class="container visible-xs"               !-- content --             /div             div id="ph_mobile_footer" class="visible-xs"               !-- footer --             /div           /div       /div   /div       i also rely on 2 sections of a new less stylesheet to tweak a few things.  for example:     //desktop: @media(min-width:768px){    h1{     font-size: 2em !important;   }    body{     background-color: @ltgrey;   }    .navbar{     width:1000px;     margin: auto;     border-right: solid black 1px;   }    .mobile{     display: none;   } }  //mobile: @media(max-width:768px){    li.inverse{     background-color: @dkgrey;     color: white;      a{       color: white;        :hover,  :focus{         background-color: @olacred;       }     }    }  }      for the record, i'm using   3.0 and php if that's relevant.  i just mention that in case   is related to this somehow.    i started with the standard       meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"      and i've tried      meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no,maximum-scale=1"      also read about css @viewport, but it doesn't seem to do the trick either.    i've even tried explicitly doing this at the end of my stylesheet:     #layout_wrapper, #layout_container,.dashboard_home_highlights, .collapse-wrapper,#alpha,#beta,.dashboard_col_1_rotonator,  .orbit   a   img, .orbit   a{   // display: none !important;   max-width:300px !important; }      blah.    so the questions are:     a. how do i fix this "viewport" issue, and b. is this all-around approach ok?    edit: here is a partial demo:        grrr...i have failed to completely reproduce the entire problem, but here you can see the approach, and one bug: if you pull this up on a phone, then zoom in, the text correctly squeezes into the view. then, zoom back out... the text does not expand again as it should, leaving extra whitespace so to speak, and scrolling down is thereafter "wobblely". this is kind of what i think is going on on a larger scale in the full project- since the 1000px site loads 'first', then the 'layout viewport' is still 1000px. thank you so much for your time   effort
