model validation error ui notification  newbie in Web UI. have a validation on some field, I manage to show the error message and everything is ok.    How do I have UI change in validation error - for example circle the field with red box so user will immediately see that? Is there some IF in the .cshtml that I miss?         BTW - I see I have some   3.0.0 reference in the project so if it will be easier hint me how to circle my form with red box...
