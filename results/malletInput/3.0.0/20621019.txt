twitter-  glyphicons bug with firefox  Currently using   3.0 for a project, I've got a weird bug with firefox: Instead of the glyphicons I get some weird characters.. when I refresh it goes back to normal..         Here is how I use glyphicons:         is this the right way to use them or is there something special I have to do ?
