  3.0 navbar-brand enlarges navbar  i'm having troubles using navbar-brand when including my logo. first of all, i am using the latest   css (get .com) and my website i am working on can be found at tensation.de/airtrade2/index.php?p=home - and the problem is also viewable there: the navbar is a bit to big whenever the logo is included. if i only use text, it's perfectly fine. you can see of how much when hovering a navbar element, it still shows a bit "lighter" color (so no hover-area) under the navigation element.    i have tried to edit it in any ways, also to take a look at the css although i am not so sure about changing it, so i rather ask here first before changing anything.    the following code is the part of the navigation bar i have problems with:          thanks for any help!
