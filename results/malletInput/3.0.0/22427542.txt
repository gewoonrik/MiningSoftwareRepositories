Bootstrap 3.0 navbar-brand enlarges navbar  I'm having troubles using navbar-brand when including my logo. First of all, I am using the latest   CSS (get .com) and my website I am working on can be found at tensation.de/airtrade2/index.php?p=home - and the problem is also viewable there: The navbar is a bit to big whenever the logo is included. If I only use text, it's perfectly fine. You can see of how much when hovering a navbar element, it still shows a bit "lighter" color (so no hover-area) under the navigation element.    I have tried to edit it in any ways, also to take a look at the CSS although I am not so sure about changing it, so I rather ask here first before changing anything.    The following code is the part of the navigation bar I have problems with:          Thanks for any help!
