Twitter Bootstrap 3.0 Responsive IMG Height Issue  I'm building a quick HTML prototype in Twitter Bootstrap 3 and hit a small snag with the height of a responsive image.     I defined three columns across with an image in each column. I set the images to be responsive and modified the padding in between each column from default  . My problem is the image in the center column is slightly larger than the images in the column to the left and right of it. Here's a quick screenshot of my problem:        How can I fix so that all three images in each column are the same height?    HTML:         Any help would be appreciated on this!
