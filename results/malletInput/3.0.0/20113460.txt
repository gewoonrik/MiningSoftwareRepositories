    3.0 responsive img height issue  i'm building a quick html prototype in     3 and hit a small snag with the height of a responsive image.     i defined three columns across with an image in each column. i set the images to be responsive and modified the padding in between each column from default  . my problem is the image in the center column is slightly larger than the images in the column to the left and right of it. here's a quick screenshot of my problem:        how can i fix so that all three images in each column are the same height?    html:         any help would be appreciated on this!
