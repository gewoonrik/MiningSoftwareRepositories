    3.0 responsive img height issue  i'm building a quick html prototype in     3 and hit a small snag with the height of a responsive image.     i defined three columns across with an image in each column. i set the images to be responsive and modified the padding in between each column from default  . my problem is the image in the center column is slightly larger than the images in the column to the left and right of it. here's a quick screenshot of my problem:        how can i fix so that all three images in each column are the same height?    html:      div class="container"     div class="row"       div class="col-sm-4 item-left"         img class="img-responsive" src="img/ -android.jpg"       /div       div class="col-sm-4 item-center"         img class="img-responsive" src="img/ -android.jpg"       /div       div class="col-sm-4 item-right"         img class="img-responsive" src="img/ -android.jpg"       /div     /div   /div       css:     img {     max-width: 100%;     height: auto;     margin: 0; } .item-left {     padding-right: 1px; } .item-center {     padding: 0 1px; } .item-right {     padding-left: 1px; }      any help would be appreciated on this!
