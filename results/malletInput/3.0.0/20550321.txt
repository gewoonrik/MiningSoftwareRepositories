Pseudo-Dynamic News Section in a static web site  currently I am rebuilding the static website of my employers and I need to integrate a news section. I am building the site using Bootstrap 3.0 framework.    I want to use the following approach:    Have a JavaScript that reads data from a .txt file with some JSON in it. For Example:         Basically I want the JSON data to be parsed and the corresponding div's to be populated in the news section of website. I think jQuery can do, its already in the Bootstrap framework.    So that whenever the news are updated (maybe twice a year) there is no need to touch the HTML but simply replace the .txt file.    And here my problem starts: I am no programmer and have no idea how such a JavaScrip would look like. If anyone has a JavaScrip JSON parser at hand and also some code examples how to populate div id="xyz" with the appropriate news data.    Also, if there is a better solution available, please let me know. CMS is not an option.  Maybe the easiest way is to integrate the news data within the JavaScript in a .js file, so in that case only the .js file needs to be updated when new news appear. As said, I am no programmer and am open to all suggestions and help.     Thanks in advance!    -Markus
