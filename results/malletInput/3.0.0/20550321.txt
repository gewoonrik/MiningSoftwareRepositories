pseudo-dynamic news section in a static web site  currently i am rebuilding the static website of my employers and i need to integrate a news section. i am building the site using   3.0 framework.    i want to use the following approach:    have a javascript that reads data from a .txt file with some json in it. for example:         basically i want the json data to be parsed and the corresponding div's to be populated in the news section of website. i think jquery can do, its already in the   framework.    so that whenever the news are updated (maybe twice a year) there is no need to touch the html but simply replace the .txt file.    and here my problem starts: i am no programmer and have no idea how such a javascrip would look like. if anyone has a javascrip json parser at hand and also some code examples how to populate div id="xyz" with the appropriate news data.    also, if there is a better solution available, please let me know. cms is not an option.  maybe the easiest way is to integrate the news data within the javascript in a .js file, so in that case only the .js file needs to be updated when new news appear. as said, i am no programmer and am open to all suggestions and help.     thanks in advance!    -markus
