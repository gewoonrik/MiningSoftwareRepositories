twitter   3.0 responsive utilities classes to display in medium and large view only  I want to display only in medium and large breakpoints and based on twbs 3.0 documentation, its not possible using their breakpoint utilities class as seen here    .com/css/#responsive-utilities     I can hide the divs when not in medium and large views         But is there a way to accomplish it using their utilities classes like .visible-lg, etc?
