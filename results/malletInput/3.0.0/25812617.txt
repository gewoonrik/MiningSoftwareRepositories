Reducing the number of items in a Bootstrap 3 carousel for mobile  I'm currently making a website in Bootstrap 3.0 with a carousel.    In mobile mode (xs) I have 4 items in the carousel, but when it gets to tablet size (sm or md) the client wants to drop this to just 2 items instead of 4.    Hiding the indicators is easy enough, you can use hidden-sm to get rid of 2 of the dots, and I've also added hidden-sm to the items themselves, but the JS that controls the carousel ignored the fact that the items are set to display: none, and it scrolls through them anyway.    Does anyone know of a way to get Bootstrap to ignore items at certain responsive breakpoints?
