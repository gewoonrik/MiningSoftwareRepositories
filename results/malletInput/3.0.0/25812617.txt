reducing the number of items in a   3 carousel for mobile  i'm currently making a website in   3.0 with a carousel.    in mobile mode (xs) i have 4 items in the carousel, but when it gets to tablet size (sm or md) the client wants to drop this to just 2 items instead of 4.    hiding the indicators is easy enough, you can use hidden-sm to get rid of 2 of the dots, and i've also added hidden-sm to the items themselves, but the js that controls the carousel ignored the fact that the items are set to display: none, and it scrolls through them anyway.    does anyone know of a way to get   to ignore items at certain responsive breakpoints?
