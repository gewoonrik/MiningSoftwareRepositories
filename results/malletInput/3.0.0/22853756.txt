mvc 5.1 should i install   for mvc 5.1  i installed vs 2013 express for web and started to create mvc 5 project.    in mvc 5,   is applied by default (i see in package folder there is   3.0.0) and i updated to mvc 5.1 in order to get   compatibility (i can apply css for @html.editorfor only in mvc 5.1 so that i decided to update the mvc 5 to mvc 5.1).    there is   for mvc 5.1 package, but if by default   3.0.0 is already applied when we first create asp.net mvc 5 project, should i install   for mvc 5.1 package? why? what are the advantages by installing this package?
