MVC 5.1 Should I Install Bootstrap for MVC 5.1  I installed VS 2013 Express for Web and started to create MVC 5 project.    In MVC 5, Bootstrap is applied by default (I see in package folder there is   3.0.0) and I updated to MVC 5.1 in order to get   compatibility (I can apply css for @Html.EditorFor only in MVC 5.1 so that i decided to update the MVC 5 to MVC 5.1).    There is Bootstrap for MVC 5.1 package, but if by default   3.0.0 is already applied when we first create ASP.NET MVC 5 project, should I install Bootstrap for MVC 5.1 package? why? what are the advantages by installing this package?
