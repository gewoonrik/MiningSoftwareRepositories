Bootstrap 2.x to 3.0 Carousel  I'm upgrading from Bootstrap 2.x to 3.0. My home page is:     .     I have two issues with the new carousel:      I want to eliminate the gray gradient on the right, so that only the image and caption are displayed (as in the old carousel).   Each item is displaying ~1745px wide, far wider than my container, which is about 1140px wide.      I searched through the CSS and tried tweaking some of the parameters, but I can't figure out the specific ones for this problem.
