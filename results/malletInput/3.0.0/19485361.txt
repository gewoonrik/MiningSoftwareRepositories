  2.x to 3.0 carousel  i'm upgrading from   2.x to 3.0. my home page is:     .     i have two issues with the new carousel:      i want to eliminate the gray gradient on the right, so that only the image and caption are displayed (as in the old carousel).   each item is displaying ~1745px wide, far wider than my container, which is about 1140px wide.      i searched through the css and tried tweaking some of the parameters, but i can't figure out the specific ones for this problem.
