    3.0 - centered search box  i'm working in   3.0 trying to make a google-style search box that has a "search help" link after the submit button.     my problem: when i go responsive i lose my offset margins and the button wraps to the next line.      media query, but i don't know how to keep the input, button, and text all together.    thanks!
