    3.0 - centered search box  i'm working in   3.0 trying to make a google-style search box that has a "search help" link after the submit button.     my problem: when i go responsive i lose my offset margins and the button wraps to the next line.      div class="row search"     div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"       form class="form-inline" role="form"         div class="form-group"           label class="sr-only" for="" enter search terms /label           input type="search" class="form-control" id="k" name="k" placeholder="enter search terms"           input id="cn" name="cn" type="hidden" value="false" /         /div         button type="submit" id="s" class="btn btn-default"           span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search"  /span         /button         a href="#" search help /a       /form     /div   /div       c.f.:        everything's fine at >991px.  but at 991 and below i lose the offset.    this is certainly related to the  #media (min-width: 992px)  media query in  .css, but i don't know how to keep the offset.    and to make matters worse: when the viewport is  768px the button and the link wrap to the next line.     again, i'm drawn to  .css and the  min-width: 768px  media query, but i don't know how to keep the input, button, and text all together.    thanks!
