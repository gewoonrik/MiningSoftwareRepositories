how to achieve a particular width using col-mds in   3.0?  i'm using   3.0 and it provides widths in terms of  col-md-value (value-1-12).i have to design a page using it.the total page width is 1000px and its divided into 2 sections of width 280 and 720 respectively.    to achieve 1000px i have changed the max-width of the 'container' to 1000px but to achieve 280px if i use col-md-3 it gives 25% width in terms of pixels 250px ans if i use col-md-4 it give 300 somethng    so my question here is how to achieve these two widths by using col-mds because if we make our own custom style to achieve that then   will not provide us its responsive nature?         the mark looks like this as hown below:         div class="container"  ---1000px max-width--        div class="col-md-12"   --100% width---           div class="col-md-value"             /div           div class="col-md-value"            /div         /div       /div
