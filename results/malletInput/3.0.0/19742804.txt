Twitter Bootstrap 3 Removing RIGHT margin and padding on a row and col-12  I'm using Twitter Bootstrap 3.0 LESS source in my Asp.Net MVC 5 project. I use a Top Navbar ( as given here ) and then few more rows in the the layout page.    I use following for rows to take 100% page width:         But this adds an extra padding on the right of each row. This also adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page and a blank vertical gutter throughout the page is visible when scrolled the page to its right.     Removing margin-right on each row and padding-right on all col-md-12 corrects the layout. However, I don't feel this is the correct way to do it.    Any idea how to remove those unnecessary margin and padding on right once for all, throughout the resultant  .css?
