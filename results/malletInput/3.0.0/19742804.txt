    3 removing right margin and padding on a row and col-12  i'm using     3.0 less source in my asp.net mvc 5 project. i use a top navbar ( as given here ) and then few more rows in the the layout page.    i use following for rows to take 100% page width:         but this adds an extra padding on the right of each row. this also adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page and a blank vertical gutter throughout the page is visible when scrolled the page to its right.     removing margin-right on each row and padding-right on all col-md-12 corrects the layout. however, i don't feel this is the correct way to do it.    any idea how to remove those unnecessary margin and padding on right once for all, throughout the resultant  .css?
