focusing a   button for keyboard enter  i have a   3.0 button on a web page.  the button is not part of a form.  when this page renders, i would like for the button to be clicked if the user hits return on the keyboard.  i have a marionette event listener set up to handle the click event.    here is my button:      button class="btn btn-primary js-new pull-right" new facility /button       how do i do this?    i have tried several things - including what i thought was the obvious solution: executing  $(".js-new").first().focus() .  this does not work.
