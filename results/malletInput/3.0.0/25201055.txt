changing size of  s navbar  so i am using this navbar class :  navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-bottom  which i use to display a bar at the bottom of the page.    is it possible to somehow make it smaller in height than 40px?  saw a lot of posts about similar thing like this for exaple:  decreasing height of   3.0 navbar     but none of them worked for my navbar after modifiyng the names.
