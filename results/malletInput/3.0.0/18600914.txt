  2 or   3 for ie 7 performance wise  while i know so does not like a vs b topics hear me out.      3 has just been released with countless improvements. the one potential deal breaker is it drops ie 7 compatibility. for site's that cater to corporate users this unfortunately isn't practical since that in one particular use case is roughly 10% market still.    so supporting ie7 is a must which one would think that simply means choosing to stick with   2. however, with this    -ie7  one can easily add ie7 support back while keeping all the benefits of   3.    the one issue their is you must use boxsizing.htc polyfill for ie 7 users (   )    so my question would it be better to stick with   2 or switch to   3.0 with boxsizing.htc? b3 with .htc will be slower for the 10% ie7 users than with b2, but if barely noticeable (especially if server is caching) it would be worth it for the benefits to the rest of the 90%.    if know one knows, the next thing i guess i could test is installing the default b2 and b3 with .htc demo sites and comparing the speeds in ie7.    ps if there is a better polyfill for adding boxsizing to ie7 than the one listed above performance wise let me know.
