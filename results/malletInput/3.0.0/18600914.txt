Bootstrap 2 or Bootstrap 3 for IE 7 Performance Wise  While I know SO does not like A vs B topics hear me out.    Bootstrap 3 has just been released with countless improvements. The one potential deal breaker is it drops IE 7 compatibility. For site's that cater to corporate users this unfortunately isn't practical since that in one particular use case is roughly 10% market still.    So supporting IE7 is a must which one would think that simply means choosing to stick with Bootstrap 2. However, with this    -ie7  one can easily add IE7 support back while keeping all the benefits of Bootstrap 3.    The one issue their is you must use boxsizing.htc polyfill for IE 7 users (   )    So my question would it be better to stick with Bootstrap 2 or switch to Bootstrap 3.0 with boxsizing.htc? B3 with .htc will be slower for the 10% IE7 users than with B2, but if barely noticeable (especially if server is caching) it would be worth it for the benefits to the rest of the 90%.    If know one knows, the next thing I guess I could test is installing the default B2 and B3 with .htc demo sites and comparing the speeds in IE7.    PS If there is a better polyfill for adding boxsizing to IE7 than the one listed above performance wise let me know.
