double line behind header stops working when   applied  the stack overflow community helped me figure out how to add two different sized lines behind my section title on my website. the method can be viewed in this js fiddle:        it was working properly, until i included the     3.0 css in my layout. now, the two lines appear right on top of each other, making one thick line behind the text. this can be seen here:        if anybody could advice me on what could be causing this hiccup, it would be greatly appreciated.    the css for the header is below:         (in the jsfiddle, it is simply defined as h1, but i changed it in my layout)    thanks in advance for any help offered!
