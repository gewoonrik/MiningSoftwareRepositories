  3.0 inline headings tags  i have the following piece of code:        div class="row"       div class="col-md-12"         div class="well"           div class="clearfix"             h2 class="pull-left" heading /h2             h4 second heading /h4          /div           /div       /div     /div       the goal is to have both the h2 and the h4 next to each other, on the same base line. at this point the h4 is way above the line.    ive tried to putt this into spans, and other 'tricks' like vertical-align bottom. for some reason i just simply cannot get this on the same line, and same 'line-height like this:    heading  second heading
