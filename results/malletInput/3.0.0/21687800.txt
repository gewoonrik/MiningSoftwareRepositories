  3 - navbar collapsible until 990px  i've got this problem.   3 framework changes my navbar into collapsible version (mobile version) when it reaches 767px screen wide. i would like to change it that mobile version exists until 991px. i've seen a similar question but the correct answer is unusable for me. it says that it can be set up while downloading custom version of  , putting required value for collapsible navbar. the problem is, i use it with drupal 7 and the   version is provided autamtically form this url: netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.0/css/ .css.    so i have to override this value in my custom css file, but i've know idea what to change - i believe there are many of classes to change. by the way, it might be important, i don't use less version.    regards,  david
