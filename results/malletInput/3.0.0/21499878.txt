Width of form elements inside an inline form in Bootstrap 3.1  I'm migrating the application that I'm working on from version 3.0 to 3.1. The application is in an initial phase (almost a prototype) with few pages implemented. So was not expecting much trouble with the migration given that it is a minor version number update and the preliminary phase of the application.    One thing that puzzled me on this migration was that the controls inside inline forms were no longer occupying 100% of the width available.    Debugging on a browser I could notice that the  . Plus, you should stretch the viewport to "unstack" elements and see the problem when the form is inline.    Anyone to help?
