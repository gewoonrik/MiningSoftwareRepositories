width of form elements inside an inline form in   3.1  i'm migrating the application that i'm working on from version 3.0 to 3.1. the application is in an initial phase (almost a prototype) with few pages implemented. so was not expecting much trouble with the migration given that it is a minor version number update and the preliminary phase of the application.    one thing that puzzled me on this migration was that the controls inside inline forms were no longer occupying 100% of the width available.    debugging on a browser i could notice that the  width: 100%;  property of  .form-control  class was being overriden by this:         .form-inline .form-control {         display: inline-block;         width: auto;         vertical-align: middle;      }      i don't understand much of css, but putting  width: 100%;  on each form element solves the problem although it does not seem to be the best solution. i couldn't figure out why the selector  .form-inline .form-control  was created with  width:auto; .    here is a fiddle with the problem:    . notice that the first element is forcefully set with  width: 100%; . plus, you should stretch the viewport to "unstack" elements and see the problem when the form is inline.    anyone to help?
