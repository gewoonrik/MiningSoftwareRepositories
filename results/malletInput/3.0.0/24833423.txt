is there anyway to change the font color of the navbar for different screen sizes  i'm using   3.0 and i want to change the color of my navigation menu for different screen sizes(e.g. red for iphone, black for tablet e.t.c).i have tried doing this using media queries but have no luck so far.    i have tried numerous methods:     @media(max-width:480px) {     .navbar-brand{          position: absolute;     top: 0;     left: 0;     width:170px;     height:70px;      }     navbar-nav{      color:#000000;       }     }   @media(max-width:480px) {     .navbar-brand{          position: absolute;     top: 0;     left: 0;     width:170px;     height:70px;      }     ul{      color:#000000;       }     }      i 've tried assigning different id's still no luck.can anyone help?    edit: added     with whole css and the html part, maybe i missed something.
