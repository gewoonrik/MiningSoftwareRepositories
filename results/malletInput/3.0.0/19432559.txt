  mobile nav gets cut off by window shade when applying roll over  i am using the modern business   theme:    .com/templates/modern-business/  and when i apply the css code to have the main menu do rollover menus:     ul.nav li.dropdown:hover   ul.dropdown-menu {     display: block;  }      in mobile view the bottom menu gets cut off by the 'navbar-collapse' container. i have tried going through all of the css code multiple times using z-index and position but nothing is changing. does anyone know how to make the drop down menu appear above the parent container. the flip side to this when i use this css (   cdn.com/ /3.0.0-rc1/css/ .css ) it works fine but i cannot find the specific place where the code is different from the css i am using (   .com/templates/modern-business/css/ .css ), i mean i know it is different but the nav tags are all pretty similar.
