modal not working  i am working on a personal project with   3 but when i add things like modals/dropdowns they dont work. i have looked at the code and it is all fine so i am assuming that it is an issue with the linking of the files    header links:          i also have the modal which is an exact copy from the   website and all of the code for that is correct.    do i have to delete all of the other local css/js files or something?    would appreciate if someone could fix it and then send it to me as i have posted before and was unable to fix it:/    html for site:
