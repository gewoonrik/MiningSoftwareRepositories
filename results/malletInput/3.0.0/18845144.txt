Modal not working  I am working on a personal project with   3 but when i add things like modals/dropdowns they dont work. I have looked at the code and it is all fine so i am assuming that it is an issue with the linking of the files    Header links:          I also have the modal which is an exact copy from the   website and all of the code for that is correct.    Do i have to delete all of the other local css/js files or something?    Would appreciate if someone could fix it and then send it to me as i have posted before and was unable to fix it:/    Html for site:
