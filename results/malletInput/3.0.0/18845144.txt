modal not working  i am working on a personal project with   3 but when i add things like modals/dropdowns they dont work. i have looked at the code and it is all fine so i am assuming that it is an issue with the linking of the files    header links:       meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"    link href="css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen"   link href="css/carousel.css" rel="stylesheet"       footer links:       link href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.0/css/ -glyphicons.css" rel="stylesheet"     link rel="stylesheet" href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.0/css/ .min.css"     link rel="stylesheet" href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.0/css/ -theme.min.css"     script src="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.0/js/ .min.js"  /script       i also have the modal which is an exact copy from the   website and all of the code for that is correct.    do i have to delete all of the other local css/js files or something?    would appreciate if someone could fix it and then send it to me as i have posted before and was unable to fix it:/    html for site:
