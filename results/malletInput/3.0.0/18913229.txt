how to create a gmail like layout with     3.0  is it possible to create a gmail-like layout using     3.0, so that the layout always fits to the viewport (window height) and the sidebar as well as the content area are separately scrollable?     -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |                                                                        | |                    fixed top navbar                                    | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |         |                                                              |    | sidebar |       content area scrollable                                | | scrollable                                                             | |         |                                                              | |         |                                                              | |         |                                                              | |         |                                                              | |------------------------------------------------------------------------|       p/s : funny that of all the examples on the   3.0 site, none has a left-side navigation menu.     yes, i have an example   (   ) that is close to what i want but for some reason in ie10, everything is right-aligned.
