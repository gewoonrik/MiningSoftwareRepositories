How to create a Gmail like layout with Twitter Bootstrap 3.0  Is it possible to create a GMail-like layout using Twitter Bootstrap 3.0, so that the layout always fits to the viewport (window height) and the sidebar as well as the content area are separately scrollable?     -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |                                                                        | |                    Fixed top navbar                                    | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |         |                                                              |    | Sidebar |       Content area scrollable                                | | scrollable                                                             | |         |                                                              | |         |                                                              | |         |                                                              | |         |                                                              | |------------------------------------------------------------------------|       P/S : Funny that of all the examples on the Bootstrap 3.0 site, none has a left-side navigation menu.     Yes, I have an example  (   ) that is close to what I want but for some reason in IE10, everything is right-aligned.
