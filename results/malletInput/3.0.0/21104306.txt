Trouble with nav-justified in Bootstrap 3.0 on responsive devices  I am using the Bootstrap 3.0 framework and Modern Business theme (   .com/modern-business ). When using the default Modern Business nav settings, the main menu dropdowns work brilliantly as they should on mobile devices. However, when I change the menu to be "nav-justified" in the HTML code (using Bootstrap's "nav-justified" CSS class), the menu does not work as expected.    When you tap any menu item with dropdowns, it shows a navigation dropdown on the far left side, which runs outside of the parent CSS frame:         I am also using the Sticky Nav solution found here:  How to use the new affix plugin in twitter&#39;s   2.1.0?     Here is my HTML code for the menu:         Here, also, is the obligatory JSFiddle to examine (JS and CSS code linked in the JSFiddle panel on the left):        I'm sure I'm somehow dancing around the answer, but this thing has had me stumped for two days now, and I need a fresh brain to look at things. I'm happy to provide whatever extra code is needed to help find the answer.
