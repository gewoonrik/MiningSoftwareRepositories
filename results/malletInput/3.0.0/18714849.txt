jquery missing from boostrap.min.js 3.0.0  i've been running into a a few problems getting my     to work properly on my django site. currently my     partially works.     for example, my html file is:          !doctype html      {% load staticfiles %}       head        link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static " /css/ .min.css" %}" type="text/css" media="screen" /        script type="text/javascript" src="{% static " /js/ .min.js" %}"   /script        /head        html       body        span class="badge badge-success"  hi! /span       span class="badge" 1 /span       span class="badge badge-warning" 4 /span       span class="badge badge-important" 6 /span       span class="badge badge-info" 8 /span       span class="badge badge-inverse" 10 /span        /body       /html       this code will display badges, however the color of the badges is not displayed. only a grey badge with some text in each of them is displayed. i ran my code and checked it with firebug and it said:         uncaught referenceerror: jquery is not defined                   .min.js:6      i assume that i am missing jquery in this project.     could someone provide a step by step process on how to fix the issue? i'm new to web development. thank you for all the input! much appreciated!
