    3.0 row wider than window  i was fiddling around with     and noticed that my      i have been glaring at this for hours without making any progress on  why or how i am  fooling myself   and searching has not been helpful.     i'm sure i am missing the obvious. i would like to understand why there is this space beyond the window width (forcing a scroller) and how to avoid it. i thought that a row would match 100%
