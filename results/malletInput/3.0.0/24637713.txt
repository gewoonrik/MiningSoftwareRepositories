  modal displays first rows data only and off centered  update: i have fixed the row data display. i had an error in my sql/php where i called the response from sql to early. still have an issue with modal not centering.    i have set up a table and the first row is a button to a   modal. the link attached to it seems to work correctly  but when you select the button the modal display only partially on  screen and always displays the first rows data even when selecting other rows in the table.     link to page  using   3.0.0 jquery 1.11.1    php script
