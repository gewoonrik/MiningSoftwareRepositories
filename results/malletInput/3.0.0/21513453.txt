  3.0 - how do i make 2 buttons the same width?  i've got two buttons.  one with the text that is very long, and the other with text that has a short length.     the default with bs is to vary the length of the button based on the length of the text.  my question is: how can i make them both the same length, irregardless of text length.      see my example here:          thank you!
