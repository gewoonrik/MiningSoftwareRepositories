Bootstrap 3.0 - How do I make 2 buttons the same width?  I've got two buttons.  One with the text that is very long, and the other with text that has a short length.     The default with BS is to vary the length of the button based on the length of the text.  My question is: how can I make them both the same length, irregardless of text length.      See my example here:          Thank you!
