why isn't   device-width using the entire width of my browser?  i'm trying to follow a   tutorial but the first div i'm creating, that should be spanning the entire width of my browser/device, seems to be limited at ~1000 pixels. any ideas as to why this is?    here's my code:      !doctype html   html lang="en"   head       meta charset="utf-8"       title testing the   3.0 grid system /title       meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"       !--   --       link href="css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen"       style      .col-xs-12 {         height: 100px;         background-color: blue;         color:white;         text-align: center;     }      /style   /head   body       div class="container"       div class="row"           div class="col-xs-12" .col-xs-12 /div       /div   /div    /body   /html       thanks in advance for any help.
