Bootstrap 3.0.0 nav vertical collapse responsive  After many search without results, I try to send a post.     I'm looking for a way for the nav-stacked (vertical menu) from   3.0.0 (   .com/components/#nav-pills ) or my sidebare becomes collapsed when tablet or smartphone is used (such as navbar).     I'm agree to use other component that nav-stacked if the result is a vertical responsive menu.    My code         Thank you in advance for your help :-)
