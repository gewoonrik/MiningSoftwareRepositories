  fixed container with parent width  i'm developing a web with   3.0 and it has the following structure:     - sidebar: width 220px, position fixed and top:0 - content: margin-left:220px (because of the sidebar width).      - topbar: position fixed and top 0      the problem is that the fixed topbar doesn't get parent width, you can see my css in this codepen:        the topbar is on .main-content header {} as you can see i added width:inherit, but it doesn't seem to work
