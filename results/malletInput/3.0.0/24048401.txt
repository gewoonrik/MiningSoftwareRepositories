how do i allow the tabs of a   tab to work within the ckeditor editor?  here is the challenge i'm struggling with.  i have a user that wants to be able to tab through the different tabs with   tabs that are in a single ckeditor instance.  i understand the reasons why links are disabled for most a tags, but would like to allow the event to occur for just these tab links.  i've attached a screenshot showing the editor with a   tab region in the content.         basically, if the user hits "facilities", "products", "partners" or "sustainability" i would like the associated view below to show so the user could edit the content for each tab-pane.    link to fiddle showing the issue:  jsfiddle sample
