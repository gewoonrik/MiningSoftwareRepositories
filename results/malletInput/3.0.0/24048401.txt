How do I allow the tabs of a   tab to work within the ckeditor editor?  Here is the challenge I'm struggling with.  I have a user that wants to be able to tab through the different tabs with   tabs that are in a single ckeditor instance.  I understand the reasons why links are disabled for most a tags, but would like to allow the event to occur for just these tab links.  I've attached a screenshot showing the editor with a   tab region in the content.         Basically, if the user hits "Facilities", "Products", "Partners" or "Sustainability" I would like the associated view below to show so the user could edit the content for each tab-pane.
