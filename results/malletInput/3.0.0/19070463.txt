using  , but text not responsive  i am working on a school project :        and i am using the framework   3.0 - and almost everything is responsive, but the text.     i've tried using percentages and ems for font sizes..but nothing is working. i know i'm missing something, but can't figure it out.     any help is appreciated.     thanks.
