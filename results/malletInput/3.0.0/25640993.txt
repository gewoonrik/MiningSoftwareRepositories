integrating     3.2 on a symfony 2.3 project  i tried to integrate     3.2 on my symfony 2.3 project.    just found tutorials for   3.0 with leafo/lessphp , but this is not supported anymore and in addition it is not working for   3.2 . i found nothing similar to leafo/lessphp that supports the latest   version.    is there any way to integrate   3.2 on a symfony 2.3 project ?    regards
