Integrating Twitter Bootstrap 3.2 on a Symfony 2.3 project  I tried to integrate Twitter Bootstrap 3.2 on my Symfony 2.3 project.    Just found Tutorials for Bootstrap 3.0 with leafo/lessphp , but this is not supported anymore and in addition it is not working for Bootstrap 3.2 . I found nothing similar to leafo/lessphp that supports the latest Bootstrap version.    Is there any way to integrate Bootstrap 3.2 on a Symfony 2.3 project ?    Regards
