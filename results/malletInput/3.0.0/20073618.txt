using   3.0 modals to load dynamic, remote content within an iframe  i have tried several of the suggestions posted here on other questions and on stackexchange, and nothing is working to my satisfaction.     i am trying to load dynamic content into a modal. specifically, youtube videos or soundcloud audio within an iframe. so that any user who visits the site, can enter links for videos or audio.  the modal then dynamically loads that users links.  each subsequent user can see each others links, all within a modal. (separate modal loads up for each user)     i can't get this to work quite right. i have created a separate html file called "modal.html" to test this out, which includes an iframe with the proper youtube/soundcloud clip.      i am also confused about whether i need to use "data-remote=" inside my tag, or does the href suffice? or do i use the data-remote inside the first of the modal. or both, or either? neither has worked.    here's my code:      a data-toggle="modal" href="modal.html" data-target="#mymodal" click me /a    div class="modal fade" id="mymodal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" data-     remote="modal.html" aria-labelledby="mymodallabel" aria-hidden="true"      div class="modal-dialog"   div class="modal-content"     div class="modal-header"       button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true"  times; /button   h4 class="modal-title" id="mymodallabel" modal title /h4     /div     div class="modal-body"      /div     div class="modal-footer"       button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-dismiss="modal" close /button       button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" save changes /button     /div   /div  !-- /.modal-content --     /div  !-- /.modal-dialog --   /div  !-- /.modal --
