col-xs-6   stacked as col-xs-12  I'm using Bootstrap 3.0 with Wordpress and my columns are not working in my second row. I want them to be displayed as 2 divs in the same row. Instead they are stacked and I can't seem to figure out where I'm going wrong. I'm just getting started and using internal styles in my header to make tweaks to my grid and get my layout down.     I'm running this on localhost using MAMP and Chrome. Any help will be greatly appreciated!    Here's the code so far:    index.php
