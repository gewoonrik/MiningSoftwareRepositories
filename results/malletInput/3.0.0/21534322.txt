glyphicons become corrupted if   css file is hosted locally  i'm using     3.0 on a project. there's a fixed requirement of not hosting any files externally. but when i host the  .css  and  .js  files locally, the  glyphicons  become corrupted.    here's what it should look like:         using    .min.css  from the original cdn  issues no errors, but placing the same file on the local server will affect the icons rendering, like in the image below:         it doesn't seem to matter if i download and save the original file using wget, downthemall, or open it on firefox and use the "save as" feature. it doesn't matter if the   link   href is  href="/css/ .min.css ,  href="  .min.css  or  href="  .min.css .    my dev machine is running linux. i can only use it to browse the site, both on my dev machine and in production. i'm using firefox 26,  but changing the value of  security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy   has no effect. as far as i can tell, the only difference that causes the render error is the css file location.    the issue happens both on my dev machine and in the live server.
