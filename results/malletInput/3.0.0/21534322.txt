glyphicons become corrupted if   css file is hosted locally  i'm using     3.0 on a project. there's a fixed requirement of not hosting any files externally. but when i host the    has no effect. as far as i can tell, the only difference that causes the render error is the css file location.    the issue happens both on my dev machine and in the live server.
