Unable to Install or Update Packagist package "twbs/ " with composer  I work on a French version of WindowsNT (I stated that you are not surprised by the names in French like "Mes Documents").    I want to add the  "twbs/ "  package in my symfony2 project. Like I've done a hundred times before, I've add the line :         So it seems that the download of the package has been completed and the only problem come from the update of the composer cache and I've no idea why.    For your information my composer still working when I try to update other package or install new ones.  "twbs/ "  is the only one that cause this problem.    If you can give me ideas to solve this problem I would be very grateful to you.
