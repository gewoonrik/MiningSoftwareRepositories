  3.0 - fluid grid that includes fixed column sizes  i am learning how to use  . currently, i'm wading my way through layouts. while   is pretty cool, everything i see seems dated. for the life of me, i have what i think is a basic layout that i can't figure out. my layout looks like the following:     --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |       |       |                                                         | |       |       |                                                         | | 240px | 160px | all remaining width of the window                       | |       |       |                                                         | |       |       |                                                         | --------------------------------------------------------------------------|      this grid needs to take up the full height of the window. from my understanding, i need to mix fixed and fluid widths. however,   3.0 doesn't seem to have the fluid class anymore. even if it did, i can't seem to figure out how to mix fluid and fixed column sizes. does anyone know how to do this in   3.0?    thank you
