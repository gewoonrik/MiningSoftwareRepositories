Bootstrap 3.0 - Fluid Grid that includes Fixed Column Sizes  I am learning how to use Bootstrap. Currently, I'm wading my way through layouts. While Bootstrap is pretty cool, everything I see seems dated. For the life of me, I have what I think is a basic layout that I can't figure out. My layout looks like the following:         This grid needs to take up the full height of the window. From my understanding, I need to mix fixed and fluid widths. However, Bootstrap 3.0 doesn't seem to have the fluid class anymore. Even if it did, I can't seem to figure out how to mix fluid and fixed column sizes. Does anyone know how to do this in Bootstrap 3.0?    Thank you
