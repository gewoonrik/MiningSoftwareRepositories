jQuery / HTML5 select and style parent and all children  I'm using   3.0 to make a nifty looking sidebar. I'm looking to clone the  current little bit of HTML with jQuery and append it to the page:         Currently, I'm not getting the behavior I hoped, and you can see that  here     I know that HTML4 doesn't allow divs inside of anchor tags, but I'm using Chrome and I still can't get the styling right (notice that   CSS and  .js are included in the fiddle).  I've got a couple questions:      Why isn't the newly appended jQuery object being styled the same way as the one that's included in the source?   Why is jQuery appending the an extra copy of the initial jQuery object?
