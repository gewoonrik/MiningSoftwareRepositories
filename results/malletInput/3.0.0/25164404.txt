jQuery.dialog() is not doing anything  I've got a simple list of thumbnails that link to a larger version of that image, which I want to display in a jQuery modal dialog window:         I am using the following files:      jquery-1.10.2.js (v1.10.2 - comes with ASP.NET MVC5 by default)   jquery-ui.min.js (v1.11.0 - latest version)    .js (v3.0.0 - comes with ASP.NET MVC5 by default)      Any suggestions on how to fix this please? I'm not getting any errors at all in Chrome's console.    Thank you
