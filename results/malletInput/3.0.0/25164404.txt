jquery.dialog() is not doing anything  i've got a simple list of thumbnails that link to a larger version of that image, which i want to display in a jquery modal dialog window:     $('a.modal').bind('click', function() {     var $this = $(this);     var outputholder = $(' div id="modal-output"  /div ');     $("body").append(outputholder);     outputholder.html(' img src="'+$this.attr("href")+'" ', null, function() {         outputholder.dialog();     });     return false; });      the outputholder div is being added to the page correctly, and it's being populated by the image, which is great... however, the  .dialog()  command is not doing anything, it isn't adding the dialog tags and the html just looks like this:      div id="uimodal-output"        img src="image.jpg"   /div       i am using the following files:      jquery-1.10.2.js (v1.10.2 - comes with asp.net mvc5 by default)   jquery-ui.min.js (v1.11.0 - latest version)    .js (v3.0.0 - comes with asp.net mvc5 by default)      any suggestions on how to fix this please? i'm not getting any errors at all in chrome's console.    thank you
