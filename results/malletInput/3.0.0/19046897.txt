ajax and   modal windows  i have a     project and i am loading a view into it when the modal appears:         i did originally assume that since the page is loaded already, i don't need to load jquery and all the   js in the modal view as they are available in the main page already, however, this doesn't seem to be the case.      when i load the view without any calls to libraries, the ajax fails   however, loading the view and calling the libraries means my ajax form works      does this mean i have to sacrifice speed of modal loading and reload the libraries or is there another way to re-use the jquery already loaded to the page?    ps. sorry if this has been asked before - i couldn't find it. pps. no code snippets as this seems more abstract than specific (but not too abstract to get the question closed, i hope!), but happy to update my question if this would help ppps. i'm using   3.0.0
