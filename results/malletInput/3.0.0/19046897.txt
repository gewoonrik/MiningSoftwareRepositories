Ajax and Bootstrap Modal windows  I have a Twitter   project and I am loading a view into it when the modal appears:         I did originally assume that since the page is loaded already, I don't need to load JQuery and all the Bootstrap JS in the modal view as they are available in the main page already, however, this doesn't seem to be the case.      When I load the view without any calls to libraries, the ajax fails   However, loading the view and calling the libraries means my ajax form works      Does this mean I have to sacrifice speed of modal loading and reload the libraries or is there another way to re-use the JQuery already loaded to the page?    PS. Sorry if this has been asked before - I couldn't find it. PPS. No code snippets as this seems more abstract than specific (but not too abstract to get the question closed, I hope!), but happy to update my question if this would help PPPS. I'm using Bootstrap 3.0.0
