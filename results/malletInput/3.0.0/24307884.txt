Eonasdan datetimepicker for   3 in xPages  I'm having a problem with the   dateTimePicker control in my xpage application and I suspect this is to do with the way xPages generates a control id.    The following code works fine without an id on the inputText element.               UPDATE #1:    Sounds like there's a bit of misunderstanding going on so I'll try to explain further...      In testing, I wrote the code in pure html giving the field an ID and it works fine.    If I use an xpage field (where domino generates the ID using colons) the date picker fails with the error described above.    I do not use the ID to bind the event to the field, I use a class get the field then bind the datetimepicker control to it.      The problem appears to be the datetimepicker using the field id. Even though I obtain the field through the class name (Not the id) the datetimepicker code seems to want to use an id if one is found in the field. The datetimepicker binds to the field without any problems. When you attempt to select a time the model box displays and allows you to select a time, the error occurs when you try to click away from the field to close the model time control.
