Sortable & Droppable JQuery Navigation  I am trying to create a navigation menu with   3.0 that has sortable "Tabs" which is working. What I am trying to implement is the ability to drag the sortable "Tabs" into the "drop down" menu and back again which also contains sortable list items.    Can anyone tell me how to do this?    I have created a Fiddle here:          to try and explain a little better.    I hope someone can help me!     Thanks
