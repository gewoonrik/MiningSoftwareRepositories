what happened to nav-header class?  with   2.3.2 you could use the  nav-header  class as follows to create a grouped list.      ul class="nav nav-pills nav-stacked"       li class="nav-header" group a /li       li  a href="/items/1" item 1 /a  /li       li  a href="/items/2" item 2 /a  /li       li  a href="/items/3" item 3 /a  /li       li class="nav-header" group b /li       li  a href="/items/4" item 4 /a  /li       li  a href="/items/5" item 5 /a  /li   /ul        reference     in   3.0.0 the  nav-header  class seems to have been removed, though i can't find any mention of it being removed in the docs. i also can't find a replacement.    is this kind of functionality still present?  if so, what's the new way?
