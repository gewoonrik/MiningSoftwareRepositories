rails 4.0 btn-btn-danger button issues  when i add the     3.0  danger button to my code and run it in heroku it looks shaded out. however when i run the app in  localhost it looks normal. the code i am using is as follows      %= link_to "post a job today: $169 for 45 days", new_listing_path , class: "btn btn-danger btn-lg" %       button in heroku/production mode:         button displayed in localhost:          .css file      @import ' ';   .btn-lg {     font-size: 20px; }      also remove the default scaffold.css file    updated 17/06    inspect element on chrome shows #fff (white) - correct on firefox it shows #666 (dark)    so how would i change this as not come across this before
