  v. 3.0 with octopress or jekyll  i am experimenting with octopress and jekyll and want to implement  s   in version 3.0. i found some themes for octopress that are based on   version 2.3. now i am wondering how to use version 3.0 with octopress.    is there a script to implement  sass    or from the  original sources ?
