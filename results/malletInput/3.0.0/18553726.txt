Twitter Boostrap Modal - Grey background but no window  I'm having a bit of an odd problem with Twitter Bootstrap and the non-JS examples of modal, what happens is that the modal background appears (greys) but the window does not.    I've found if I remove the "hide" class from the modal windows div, it will load but not correctly.    The Fiddle is here:             The code has come from this tutorial on Bootstraps website    .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#modals
