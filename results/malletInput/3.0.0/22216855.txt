Jquery Conflict in Bootsrap Drop Down with External Plugin  I am working on a Website where I am facing a conflict issue between BOOTSTRAP DROP DOWN and a new Plugin Drop Down to select Country Name   Flag. It is created using BOOTSTRAP 3.0 and my drop Down was working fine till I implemented the COUNTRY FLAG SELECTION drop down.    The source from where I downloaded Country Flag Drop Down can be found here :
