  3.0 text disappears on refresh  i'm trying to use   3.0 as a template to create a website. the issue i'm having is that when you refresh the page all of the text disappears. it does not do it every time but 8/10 times it does. here is the demo i have put on my website for you guys to check it out.        please let me know if you have any questions or need to see any code.
