Bootstrap 3.0 Text Disappears on refresh  I'm trying to use Bootstrap 3.0 as a template to create a website. The issue I'm having is that when you refresh the page all of the text disappears. It does not do it every time but 8/10 times it does. Here is the demo I have put on my website for you guys to check it out.        Please let me know if you have any questions or need to see any code.
