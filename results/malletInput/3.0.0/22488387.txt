why are my   column classes stacking instead of sitting alongside one another in a row?  i've just setup   3.0 and following a tutorial by william helfi:  william helfi   tutorial     the issue i'm having is that my columns of class 'col-md-6 are stacking on top of each other instead of being located alongside one another in the same row. this is despite me copying and pasting the exact code from the tutorial. 6+6=12 so i expect them to fit on one row but they do not. it's really frustrating. what am i missing? i've tried two tutorials, exactly, and i get the same result.      screenshot of issue
