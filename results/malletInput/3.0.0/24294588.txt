set css @media min-width value with javascript  i am using   3.0 for my website and i use @media queries in css to create a responsive design. i would like to add a button that allows someone on a phone to view the site as they would see it on a larger desktop screen.     is there a way i can force css to think that the max-width/min-width is a certain size? i don't want to actually show scrollbars, just change what rules are applied to match what would be shown for larger screen sizes.
