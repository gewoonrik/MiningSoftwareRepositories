Set CSS @Media min-width value with javascript  I am using   3.0 for my website and i use @media queries in CSS to create a responsive design. I would like to add a button that allows someone on a phone to view the site as they would see it on a larger desktop screen.     Is there a way i can force CSS to think that the max-width/min-width is a certain size? I don't want to actually show scrollbars, just change what rules are applied to match what would be shown for larger screen sizes.
