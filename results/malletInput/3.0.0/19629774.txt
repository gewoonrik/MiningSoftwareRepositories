How to center align   progressbar?  I'm trying to center the text inside a progressbar using twitter-  framework v3.0.0.    I've tried  this solution , but I'm afraid not working on the new version of the framework.    So I tried this:         Here is the fiddle:        As you can see it centers the text in the filled part or in the empty part, but not respect all the content.    Do you have any idea, or advice advice to do it?
