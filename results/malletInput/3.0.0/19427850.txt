Disabled a list-group-item in Bootstrap 3.0  I've been using the   3.0 and I was wondering how can I disable a list-group-item.    What I tried was to put the disabled atribute in the "a" tag but this not had any effect. I also tried to add the disabled class with the same result.    Here some example:         Thanks
