disabled a list-group-item in   3.0  i've been using the   3.0 and i was wondering how can i disable a list-group-item.    what i tried was to put the disabled atribute in the "a" tag but this not had any effect. i also tried to add the disabled class with the same result.    here some example:      div class="list-group"     a href="#" class="list-group-item" add new entry /a     a href="#" class="list-group-item disabled" delete entry /a   /div       thanks
