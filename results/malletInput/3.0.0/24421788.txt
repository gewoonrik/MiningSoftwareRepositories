Active tab wont deactivate when another is linked  I am using   3.0 and have done a link to tab number 4 called "Installer Resources" on the bottom of tab number 1 called "Overview." The link is "apply."    However you will not the page does not scroll nor does the 4th tab "Installer Resources" become active even though the content of tab 4 does show after the link is clicked.    I would say that I have a special javascript for this, but it's just   3.0.0    Any ideas what could be wrong?    Thank you. :)     link
