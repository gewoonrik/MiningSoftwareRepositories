active tab wont deactivate when another is linked  i am using   3.0 and have done a link to tab number 4 called "installer resources" on the bottom of tab number 1 called "overview." the link is "apply."    however you will not the page does not scroll nor does the 4th tab "installer resources" become active even though the content of tab 4 does show after the link is clicked.    i would say that i have a special javascript for this, but it's just   3.0.0    any ideas what could be wrong?    thank you. :)     link
