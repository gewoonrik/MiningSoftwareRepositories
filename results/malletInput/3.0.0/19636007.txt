how to make background of madal scrollable while modal is open?  i have created a   modal,when it pops up the vertical scrollbar of the background page gets disable and contents of the background page move to their right side in the same amount of scrollbars width.so i want to avoid that move of the contents of page, and make background scrollable while modal is open? (note that i am using   3.0.0 modal) so,please give me some hint to do that.thank you in advance . . .
