boostrap 3 modals not working on rails 4  i am using     3 for my project but cannot seem to get the modals to work correctly when loading remote content.    my "application" layout is the following:         for some odd reason i get the modal displayed without a background when adding the "remote-data" attribute.       i have tried removing "turbo_links" but it has been futile. this only seem to happen in rails though, as i have tried a similar example in jsfiddle and it works fine! please see        please help and thanks in advance !
