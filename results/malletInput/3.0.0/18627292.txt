Boostrap 3 modals not working on Rails 4  I am using twitter   3 for my project but cannot seem to get the modals to work correctly when loading remote content.    My "application" layout is the following:         For some odd reason I get the modal displayed without a background when adding the "remote-data" attribute.       I have tried removing "turbo_links" but it has been futile. This only seem to happen in rails though, as I have tried a similar example in jsfiddle and it works fine! Please see        Please help and thanks in advance !
