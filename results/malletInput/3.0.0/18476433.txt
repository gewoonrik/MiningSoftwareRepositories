Strange behavior from   with element immediately following legend  So I'm using Twitter's   3.0 and have a div immediately following a   tag in Chrome.    Here's a jsFiddle that demonstrates the effect:        You'll notice the second item the legend is moved down 50 pixels instead of the div below it.    And in the third item the legend is moved up 50 pixels instead of the div above it.    Is there anyway to change the margin of the item immediately following the legend  without  having it affect the location of the legend?
