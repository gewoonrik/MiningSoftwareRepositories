strange behavior from   with element immediately following legend  so i'm using  's   3.0 and have a div immediately following a   legend   inside of a   form  .    the weird thing is that when i change the margin top of this div, it actually moves the legend up and down (with reference to the enclosing   form   tag in chrome.    here's a jsfiddle that demonstrates the effect:        you'll notice the second item the legend is moved down 50 pixels instead of the div below it.    and in the third item the legend is moved up 50 pixels instead of the div above it.    is there anyway to change the margin of the item immediately following the legend  without  having it affect the location of the legend?
