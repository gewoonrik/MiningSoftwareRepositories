font awesome(4.0.3) +  (3.0.0) + asp.net: changing font family  I am using font awesome(4.0.3) and  (3.0.0) and I just want to change the font. But there is a problem. All the css-classes like "fa fa-group" from "font awesome" are not going to be displayed anymore,instead there is a small rectangle with the Unicode sign in it like "F06E"(seperated in 2 lines) (The text is formated, but the symbols are going to be converted to unicode-text).    HTML:         What can I do ?!     Live-example on JSFiddle     Best regards Martin
