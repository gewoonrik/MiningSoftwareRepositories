using   3.0 with browserify  i am trying to use   3.0 with browserify 5.9.1, but getting the following error:     uncaught referenceerror: jquery is not defined      what's the correct way to do this?    here are the relavant portions of my package.json:     {   ...   "scripts": {     "bundle": "browserify main.js -o bundle.js --debug --list"   },   "dependencies": {     "backbone": "~1.1.x",     "jquery": "~2.1.x",     "underscore": "~1.6.x"   },   "devdependencies": {     "browserify": "^5.9.1",     ...   },   ... }      the module that requires   is shown below:     var $ = require('jquery'); var backbone = require('backbone'); backbone.$ = $; require('../../../../bower_components/ -sass-official/assets/javascripts/ ');      two things that i don't like here are:        is downloaded using bower. afaik there is no way to get it using npm. this makes the path very long and awkward. is there a way to make   npm friendly?     is not a direct dependency of this module, it is sort of a jquery plugin. when it is loaded, it simply creates some event handlers on the document to handle events from bootstarp's widgets. i have to require just so that these event handlers are created. is this the right way?      of course after all this, i still get the "jquery is not defined" error. i am pulling my hair out trying to get this to work. please help!    p.s. earlier i had the grunt-browserify plugin in the picture and quickly realized that it was using browserify version 4.x with no source map capability. this was making it even harder to debug, so i quickly took it out of the picture and running browserify straight from npm.
