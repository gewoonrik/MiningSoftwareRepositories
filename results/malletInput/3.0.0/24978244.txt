Using Bootstrap 3.0 with Browserify  I am trying to use Bootstrap 3.0 with Browserify 5.9.1, but getting the following error:         Two things that I don't like here are:      Bootstrap is downloaded using Bower. AFAIK there is no way to get it using npm. This makes the path very long and awkward. Is there a way to make Bootstrap npm friendly?   Bootstrap is not a direct dependency of this module, it is sort of a jQuery plugin. When it is loaded, it simply creates some event handlers on the document to handle events from Bootstarp's widgets. I have to require just so that these event handlers are created. Is this the right way?      Of course after all this, I still get the "jQuery is not defined" error. I am pulling my hair out trying to get this to work. Please help!    P.S. Earlier I had the grunt-browserify plugin in the picture and quickly realized that it was using browserify version 4.x with no source map capability. This was making it even harder to debug, so I quickly took it out of the picture and running browserify straight from npm.
