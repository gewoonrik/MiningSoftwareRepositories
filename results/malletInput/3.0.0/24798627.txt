Functions.php wordpress not working for stylesheets or jquery  I am making my first custom wordpress theme and am running into problems with functions.php    I am using   too so i want to include   stylesheets to wp i currently do it this way-:         This does not seem to work. Neither does functions.php load the wp jquery or the  .js    Can anyone shed some light onto this matter for me? I would be ever grateful. This is not a child theme its a custom theme.
