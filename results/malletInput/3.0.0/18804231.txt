Position a Bootstrap 3.0 label directly on top of an input field without pushing content down  I have a   3.0 horizontal form.    I am appending, using jquery, a Bootstrap label directly before the form-group div.         Id like to position this label directly over the input field so that the error message looks like it is being displayed inside the input text field.    I can do this using some css but it keeps pushing the content down between each field where the span would normally be show in the html.    I need to be able to position relatively and float at the same time.     Can this be done?
