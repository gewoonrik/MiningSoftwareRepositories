position a   3.0 label directly on top of an input field without pushing content down  i have a   3.0 horizontal form.    i am appending, using jquery, a   label directly before the form-group div.         id like to position this label directly over the input field so that the error message looks like it is being displayed inside the input text field.    i can do this using some css but it keeps pushing the content down between each field where the span would normally be show in the html.    i need to be able to position relatively and float at the same time.     can this be done?
