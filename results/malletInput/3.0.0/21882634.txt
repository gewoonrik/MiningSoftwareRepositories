Sidebar implemented in   3.0 overlaps my content and when page is refreshed it switches back to normal working position  I have successfully implemented a nested sidebar from     in my website built from twitter  .The nested sidebar is fully responsive but however whenever i load the website for first time the sidebar overlaps my content as shown in this pic          And after i refresh my website the sidebar shifts to its normal position and starts working as expected.    This is sidebar's CSS code          'content' is a div that contains all my text portion and 'menu' contains the nested sidebar menu.    Please help as i can't complete my website without this.
