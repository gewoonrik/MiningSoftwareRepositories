    3.0 carousel formatting with text  i am trying to get     carousel working (3.0+) with some formatting so i cycle through image on the right/text on the left- image on the left, then text on the right.    when rendered (rails 3.13) it seems as if the grid system is suspended-images are jammed on the left border here is my fiddle:           but the example is lifted straight out of the   website:         is this by design?  (this is my first post)
