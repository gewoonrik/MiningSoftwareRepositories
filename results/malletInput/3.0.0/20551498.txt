Twitter Bootstrap 3.0 Carousel formatting with text  I am trying to get twitter   carousel working (3.0+) with some formatting so I cycle through image on the right/text on the left- image on the left, then text on the right.    When rendered (rails 3.13) it seems as if the grid system is suspended-images are jammed on the left border here is my fiddle:           but the example is lifted straight out of the   website:         Is this by design?  (This is my first post)
