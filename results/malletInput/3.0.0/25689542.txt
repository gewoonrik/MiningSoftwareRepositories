  3.0 grid newbie problems  i am trying to construct a form using   grid but ran into some problems. the page can be found on  input-page     the first problem is the section width. the form is 5,5,2 = 12 but in the two 5 columns the element doesn't show correctly.    second how do i get the input fields nearer, vertically, to each-other?    third how do i get the columns the same vertical size so it doesn't show the main background colour?
