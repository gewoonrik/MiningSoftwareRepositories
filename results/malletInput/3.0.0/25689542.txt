Bootstrap 3.0 grid newbie problems  I am trying to construct a form using Bootstrap Grid but ran into some problems. The page can be found on  input-page     The first problem is the section width. The form is 5,5,2 = 12 but in the two 5 columns the element doesn't show correctly.    Second how do I get the input fields nearer, vertically, to each-other?    Third how do I get the columns the same vertical size so it doesn't show the main background colour?
