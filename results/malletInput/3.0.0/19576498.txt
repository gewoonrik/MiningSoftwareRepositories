  3.0 responsive collapsible list  i wonder whether it is possible by using the core   3.0 functionality to create a responsive list with a header and not related to navbar (e.g.    .com/components/#list-group-linked ) which would on a breaking point be transformed into a collapsible list with the header (i.e. first list item) displayed. i.e. very similar to what happened with links in the footer on this page
