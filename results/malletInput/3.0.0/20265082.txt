Ember routing out from modal doesn't render correct content into the outlet  I have problem with Ember.js and Bootstrap 3.0 modal. Here is the sample jsfiddle:        My modal is implemented as subroute for the dynamic segment.    If you enter the   route.    Can anyone give me a hint if the problem here is Bootstrap's modal or Ember itself? Should I file a bug report for Ember or Bootstrap, or I did something wrong?    Thanks    Damian
