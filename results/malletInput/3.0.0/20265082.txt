ember routing out from modal doesn't render correct content into the outlet  i have problem with ember.js and   3.0 modal. here is the sample jsfiddle:        my modal is implemented as subroute for the dynamic segment.    if you enter the  test  route and then open the modal, everything works ok.    but if you follow the route directly to the  test.contact  (clicking second link from  test.index  path), and then follow the link to  other  route from modal, the content of  test  is not removed and  other  route is inserted before the content of  test  route.    can anyone give me a hint if the problem here is  's modal or ember itself? should i file a bug report for ember or  , or i did something wrong?    thanks    damian
