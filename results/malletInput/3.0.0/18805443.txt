  navbar-form width issue on chrome  i'm using   3.0.0.    while using  default navbar  example, with some custom css, i found search form text box is taking full width on chrome, due to which my navbar is broken into three lines. it is running fine on firefox and ie.    issue is, calculated width in firefox is 236px but in chrome, it is 1110px. both firefox   chrome screenshot are attached at the end. code is given after screen shots as well as at  jsfiddle  but output cant be seen there. its just for reference.    is it a known bug in chrome or more probably am i doing some mistake. if yes, can someone please figure out what mistake i did?           custom css         however i see this as hack. isn't there and better way to fix the issue?
