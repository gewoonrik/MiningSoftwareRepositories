Twitter Bootstrap V 3.0 dynamically centering navigation  Using   v3.0    Id like to dynamically center the navigation bar. i.e. A fix that doesnt hardcode a width.    How is this achieved? Below is a sample of the standard navigation code with excess tags removed.       ... shown here    .com/components/#navbar-component-alignment .    Having followed the methodology of this question:  twitter   -- center brand in nav bar  I cannot centralize the navigation using margin-left: auto; and margin-right: auto;    Any help is greatly appreciated.
