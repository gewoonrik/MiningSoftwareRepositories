Selenium WebDriver with Bootstrap menu  I need to test such situation: Call modal window by click link, fill 2 fields (login/pass) and click button ok.    Catch strange problem: I test   3.0 menu with selenium webdriver using python. When I click link showing modal window - everything ok, menu is showed. But then it hides so I can't complete test because selenium doesn't fill hidden elements. I tried different ways: sleep, thread and WebDriverWait - result negative. Have anybody the same problem? Was this problem solved?
