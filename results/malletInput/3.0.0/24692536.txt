selenium webdriver with   menu  i need to test such situation: call modal window by click link, fill 2 fields (login/pass) and click button ok.    catch strange problem: i test   3.0 menu with selenium webdriver using python. when i click link showing modal window - everything ok, menu is showed. but then it hides so i can't complete test because selenium doesn't fill hidden elements. i tried different ways: sleep, thread and webdriverwait - result negative. have anybody the same problem? was this problem solved?
