how do i close a modal window and automatically navigate to anchor using the same link?  i'm using   3.0 and i have an open modal window with two 'buttons' at the bottom, one says 'contact us' and the other says 'close'.    when someone clicks the 'contact us' button i want the modal window to close and the user to be automatically taken to a specific anchor on the same page.    the following doesn't work. it does scroll the page to the desired anchor, but the user can't see this because it doesn't close the modal window...      a class="btn btn-info" data-dismiss="modal" href="#section-contact" contact us /a
