  3.0:responsive column resets section of the documentation  hey so in the   3.0 documentation if you look under the subheading "responsive column resets" it says the following:         "with the four tiers of grids available you're bound to run into issues where, at certain breakpoints, your columns don't clear quite right as one is taller than the other. to fix that, use a combination of a .clearfix and our responsive utility classes."      now what do they mean by this? i thought floats cleared-or didn't-based on width. what am i missing here?
