  3.0, rails 4, simple_form & page generation  i'm a total beginner to programming and i'm attempting to build a form using   3, rails 4   simple_form.    problem is, every bit of help i find online relates to either   2 or rails 3.      so far, this is where i am:      html is ready to go in   3.   created new application (rails new app_name)    installed gem  -rails               now, i don't know where to go.        i don't know how to confirm that   is installed (where are the files?)   i don't know how to confirm simple_form is installed (same problem).   i don't know how to create a page to place my html in (and what sort of markup should be on that page, aside from the html i already have).      i would so appreciate anyone's explicit help (beginner - as i said! :)) and any information i may need that i just don't realize i need.      thanks in advance!
