Bootstrap 3.0, Rails 4, simple_form & Page Generation  I'm a total beginner to programming and I'm attempting to build a form using Bootstrap 3, Rails 4   simple_form.    Problem is, every bit of help I find online relates to either Bootstrap 2 or Rails 3.      So far, this is where I am:      HTML is ready to go in Bootstrap 3.   Created new application (rails new app_name)    Installed gem  -rails               Now, I don't know where to go.        I don't know how to confirm that   is installed (where are the files?)   I don't know how to confirm simple_form is installed (same problem).   I don't know how to create a page to place my HTML in (and what sort of markup should be on that page, aside from the HTML I already have).      I would so appreciate anyone's explicit help (beginner - as I said! :)) And any information I may need that I just don't realize I need.      Thanks in advance!
