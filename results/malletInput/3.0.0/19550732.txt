    is screwing up my imagemap - anyone else have this issue?  first off - this is my first question ever (i'm still a beginner) and i can't say how much i appreciate this site and all the help i've found on here. hopefully every question i ask can help someone else too :)    i realize not many people use imagemaps any more but i have one and     (version 3.0.0) is screwing up my coordinates - putting the links in the wrong places. i can make it work with the following code but then it wont resize to fit the screen. any tips?      style   !driving me nuts - without this the imagemap links are in the wrong places - with this it wont resize  #img_id {     max-width:none;     width:auto;     display: inline;  }   /style       here is a snippet of the actual imagemap code       div style="width:100%"   img id="img_id" src="newmatguide.png" usemap="#map" border="0" class="" width:100% alt=""   /div    map id="map_id" name="map"      area shape="rect" coords="80,151,258,252" href="placementresults.php?chosenarea=a"      area shape="rect" coords="80,328,258,432" href="placementresults.php?chosenarea=b"      area shape="rect" coords="80,521,258,620" href="placementresults.php?chosenarea=c"
