    is screwing up my imagemap - anyone else have this issue?  first off - this is my first question ever (i'm still a beginner) and i can't say how much i appreciate this site and all the help i've found on here. hopefully every question i ask can help someone else too :)    i realize not many people use imagemaps any more but i have one and     (version 3.0.0) is screwing up my coordinates - putting the links in the wrong places. i can make it work with the following code but then it wont resize to fit the screen. any tips?
