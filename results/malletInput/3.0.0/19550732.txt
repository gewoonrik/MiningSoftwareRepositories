Twitter Bootstrap is screwing up my imagemap - Anyone else have this issue?  First off - this is my first question ever (I'm still a beginner) and I can't say how much I appreciate this site and all the help I've found on here. Hopefully every question I ask can help someone else too :)    I realize not many people use imagemaps any more but I have one and twitter   (version 3.0.0) is screwing up my coordinates - putting the links in the wrong places. I can make it work with the following code but then it wont resize to fit the screen. Any tips?
