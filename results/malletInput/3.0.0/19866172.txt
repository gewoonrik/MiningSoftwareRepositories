  3 accordion collapse does not work on iphone  these "accordion submenus" work in chrome and firefox, but not on an iphone.    i have built a site which includes an "offcanvas" navigation menu on smaller screens.  the user clicks "the hot dog button", and the navigation menu slides onto the screen from the left... that works great so far.    some of the navigation elements contain submenus. for those, i used  's accordion markup.  the user clicks an arrow, and the "submenu" expands.          the problem     i develop using chrome on linux.  this mechanism works  perfectly  in chrome, firefox, and every browser i can get my hands on, as well as on my personal android phone.  it also works on  responsinator.com .  however, since i don't have safari, nor an iphone, i have not been able to test this functionality directly on an iphone.  i am working on getting an iphone emulator...    until then, some other people have looked at this on an iphone, and i am told the "submenus" do not work at all.  when the user clicks the arrow, nothing happens...    here is an excerpt of a "menu item" containing a "sub-menu": please note i am using the 'data-toggle' and 'data-target' attributes:         which is ' .js v3.0.0' .    does anyone have any other clues? any recent direct experience with an issue like this?    thanks in advance for your help.
