Rails 4 form builder with comprehensive support for Twitter Bootstrap 3  Is there any Rails 4 compatible form builder gem(s) that provide comprehensive support for Twitter Bootstrap 3.0.0 forms?    Here's a benchmark for what I'd consider 'comprehensive' support:      Support for all 3 layouts (basic, horizontal, inline)   Support for basic input types (input, textarea, select, etc.)   Support for both stacked   inline checkboxes/radio buttons   Support for all input states (focus, disabled, validation)   Support for help text/error messaging   Support for input-append/prepend (now referred to as input-group in TWBS3).   Support for dealing with Rails' specific form 'elements' e.g. date_select (inline select boxes)      See the TWBS3  docs  and  WIP github issue  for details on TWBS3 forms.     I've had a look at both  simple_form  and  twitter_ _form_for  and whilst both are making progress neither appear to offer a sufficient solution at the moment.     Simple form     Appears to have a solution for the basic layout, however from what I can see horizontal forms are not currently possible due to the additional grid markup required by TWBS3.                 Twitter   form for     This pull request looks promising, but I can see some inaccuracies in the markup and classes being used.        _form_for/pull/84
