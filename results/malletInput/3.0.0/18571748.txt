rails 4 form builder with comprehensive support for     3  is there any rails 4 compatible form builder gem(s) that provide comprehensive support for     3.0.0 forms?    here's a benchmark for what i'd consider 'comprehensive' support:      support for all 3 layouts (basic, horizontal, inline)   support for basic input types (input, textarea, select, etc.)   support for both stacked   inline checkboxes/radio buttons   support for all input states (focus, disabled, validation)   support for help text/error messaging   support for input-append/prepend (now referred to as input-group in twbs3).   support for dealing with rails' specific form 'elements' e.g. date_select (inline select boxes)      see the twbs3  docs  and  wip github issue  for details on twbs3 forms.     i've had a look at both  simple_form  and   _ _form_for  and whilst both are making progress neither appear to offer a sufficient solution at the moment.     simple form     appears to have a solution for the basic layout, however from what i can see horizontal forms are not currently possible due to the additional grid markup required by twbs3.                     form for     this pull request looks promising, but i can see some inaccuracies in the markup and classes being used.        _ _form_for/pull/84
