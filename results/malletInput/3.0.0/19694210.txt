  site mobile view not using full viewport  i'm currently making a responsive blog using the   3.0 framework. i'm using the 1197 max-width container for my content and it renders fine on desktops. however, when i try opening the site on my phone (i'm using an android galaxy note 2), there is a lot of extra padding on the right and left sides of the viewport. i've tried following the api docs and guides as close as possible, but still can't get this to work.    here is the site i am working on        does anyone know what is going on with this? am i doing something wrong, or do i need to override default behavior (which sounds a bit hacky to me).
