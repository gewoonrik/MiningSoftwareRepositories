angular-ui-  collapse by target  Utilizing angular-UI-Bootstrap 0.9.0, which has full   3.0 support now. Awesome...with   3.0, I could do the collapse by pointing to an ID target, but I can't figure out how to do that using the angular-UI code instead. It seems to just say, "find all isCollapsed and dump it no matter what" so now all collapsible/expandable containers operate at the same time not matter which collapse link you use. My code is identical to    /#/collapse , but with multiple collapse objects and links within the same controller. Ideas?
