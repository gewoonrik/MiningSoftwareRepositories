angular-ui-  collapse by target  utilizing angular-ui-  0.9.0, which has full   3.0 support now. awesome...with   3.0, i could do the collapse by pointing to an id target, but i can't figure out how to do that using the angular-ui code instead. it seems to just say, "find all iscollapsed and dump it no matter what" so now all collapsible/expandable containers operate at the same time not matter which collapse link you use. my code is identical to    /#/collapse , but with multiple collapse objects and links within the same controller. ideas?
