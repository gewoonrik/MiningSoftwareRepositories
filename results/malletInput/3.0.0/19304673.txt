how do you explain this div spacing issue?  this spacing issue was driving me crazy. i finally figured out that in order to have spaces between the form elements, i need to format my html code as shown below.    could somebody explain what's going on here? is this some newline issue?     notes:        i'm using   3 css file, no other styling in place   the only difference between the 2 samples below is in how  .form-group  divs are laid out       1. form elements with spaces:            !doctype html   html     head       title elements with spaces /title       link href="  cdn.com/ /3.0.0/css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen"     /head     body       form class="form-inline" role="form"         div class="form-group"           input type="email" class="form-control" placeholder="enter email"         /div         div class="form-group"           input type="password" class="form-control" placeholder="password"         /div         button type="submit" class="btn btn-default" sign in /button       /form     /body   /html        2. form elements without spaces:            !doctype html   html     head       title elements with spaces /title       link href="  cdn.com/ /3.0.0/css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen"     /head     body       form class="form-inline" role="form"         div class="form-group"           input type="email" class="form-control" placeholder="enter email"         /div  div class="form-group"           input type="password" class="form-control" placeholder="password"         /div  button type="submit" class="btn btn-default" sign in /button       /form     /body   /html
