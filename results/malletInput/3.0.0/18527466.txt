    - span columns not displaying correctly  i am trying to get started with    , but for some reason, anything i do, results in a div spanning the entire page. as such, i cannot get the grid system / navigation bar to look right as every div appears to have it's own line.    i am sure that this is a simple fix but i am completely baffled.
