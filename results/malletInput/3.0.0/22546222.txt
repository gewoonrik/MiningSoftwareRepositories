custom   3 wordpress theme failing to make row  any suggestions? single.php is still showing full-width content with sidebar under content. i set col-md-8 to content and col-md-4 to sidebar but no luck. still displaying one under the other. i tried setting the col class in sidebar.php instead of on home.php - no luck. i know wordpress is connecting to   because of other styles being applied but for some reason the row is not working correctly. i'm sure it's a quick fix, just not sure where to look.     header.php
