Dropdown-submenu not functional even after adding it to CSS and implementing in html  I am using   v3.0.0. I am aware that this does not support dropdown-submenu. Lot of solutions posted on stackoverflow and other sources provided the "dropdown-submenu" CSS that I added to my Bootstrap.css and also made changes to my HTML.     And here is my HTML:         I see the menu Scary inder Movies but it does not bring up the sub-menus when I hover over that. I am not sure what I am missing here. And it also does not show the little right arrow beside "Scary" menu.
