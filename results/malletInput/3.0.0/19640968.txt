Bootstrap buttons on android firefox  I'm using   3.0 and, when I use the built-in classes (.btn .btn-primary) to style an anchor, the pressed style (:active) gets a gray background instead of the dark blue default background.    This can be seen on   official site too. Go to    .com/css/#buttons  and click in any button (primary, success, etc...)    This only happens in Firefox for Android (other browsers in Android work fine and Firefox on desktop is also OK).    Does anyone know how to fix this? Thanks!    EDIT: As requested here is a jsfiddle to demonstrate the behavior:
