adding space between words in   3.0 (html escape characters do not work)  stackoverflow, please help!    i am developing a website using   (3.1.1) and angularjs for my friend's photography business.    the problem which i am encountering arises when trying to add a tab-space between words in the navigation bar, for example:      module, which had no affect.    i think i am missing something fundamental but i am obviously unsure as to what that is.    thanks in advance,    johndoe
