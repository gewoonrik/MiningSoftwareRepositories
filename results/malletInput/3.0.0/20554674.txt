Bootstrap Fading Carousel - 1px bump between transitions?  I'm using Bootstrap 3.0 with the carousel, but instead of it sliding to the left and right, it fades. The only thing is, when you're on a PC, there's this little 1px transition between each fade, as if the image is sliding to the left or right 1px.     My images are all the same size.     Can you tell me what the problem might be?
