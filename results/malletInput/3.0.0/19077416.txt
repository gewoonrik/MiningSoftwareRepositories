Avoiding the newline when using UL  I'm an "intermediate" CSS user but I'm having a problem that I can't seem to solve even though I suspect the answer will be surprisingly easy to fix from someone who knows more about css ...    I have a simple visual representation of a date who's markup is:         That seems to work but what I'm struggling with is when I place this widget I can't get the text that follows to be on the same horizontal line but instead it is always dropped to the next line. Here's the complete code example:           So explicitly, what I'd like is for the "Today" text to be directly to the right of the visual date widget. Note, I am using Bootstrap 3.0 ... don't think this is creating any problems but possibly would change peoples thinking somewhat. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
