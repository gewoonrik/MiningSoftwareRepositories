avoiding the newline when using ul  i'm an "intermediate" css user but i'm having a problem that i can't seem to solve even though i suspect the answer will be surprisingly easy to fix from someone who knows more about css ...    i have a simple visual representation of a date who's markup is:         that seems to work but what i'm struggling with is when i place this widget i can't get the text that follows to be on the same horizontal line but instead it is always dropped to the next line. here's the complete code example:           so explicitly, what i'd like is for the "today" text to be directly to the right of the visual date widget. note, i am using   3.0 ... don't think this is creating any problems but possibly would change peoples thinking somewhat. any help would be greatly appreciated.
