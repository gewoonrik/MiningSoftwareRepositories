avoiding the newline when using ul  i'm an "intermediate" css user but i'm having a problem that i can't seem to solve even though i suspect the answer will be surprisingly easy to fix from someone who knows more about css ...    i have a simple visual representation of a date who's markup is:      ul class="visual-date"       li class="day-of-week text-muted"          {{view.dayofweek}}      /li       li class="day-of-month"          {{view.dayofmonth}}      /li   /ul       this displays the following:         with the following css:     .visual-date {     list-style-type: none;     width: 85px;     text-align: center;     padding: 5px 1px 5px 1px;     .day-of-week {         background-color: #272927;         color: white;         font-size: 8pt;         border-top-right-radius: 4px;         border-top-left-radius: 4px;         border-width: 1px;         border-color: #cbcdca;         border-style: solid;     }     .day-of-month {         font-size: 24pt;         border-width: 1px;         border-color: #cbcdca;         border-style: solid;     } }      that seems to work but what i'm struggling with is when i place this widget i can't get the text that follows to be on the same horizontal line but instead it is always dropped to the next line. here's the complete code example:           so explicitly, what i'd like is for the "today" text to be directly to the right of the visual date widget. note, i am using   3.0 ... don't think this is creating any problems but possibly would change peoples thinking somewhat. any help would be greatly appreciated.
