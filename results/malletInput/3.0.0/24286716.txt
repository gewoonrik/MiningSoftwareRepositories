radio button's error messages displaying improperly  im using     3.0 to build a form.the form contains a radio button. this radio button is been validated by jquery, an error message appears when the radio button is not selected.my problem is with the positioning of the error message, it appears between the two buttons,but i want it to appear below or on the right side of the two buttons. this is what i have so far.          please any help is appreciated. thanks
