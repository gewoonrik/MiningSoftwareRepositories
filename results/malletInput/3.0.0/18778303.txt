in   3.0 how to add a grid cell or dynamically adjust margin of first cell in alternate rows?  i need to create a brick pattern where in every other row the first brick is half. this can be achieved by using half column width in grid when you know how many cells go in one row.    however, on smaller screens / on resize when the cells collapse to create new dynamic rows, the brick pattern breaks.     example of brick pattern:        the below code will work when there are 5 cells in a row. if the screen is resized to have only 3 cells in a row, then the third row will not begin with half brick as intended and pattern will break.
