Images not resizing (default Bootstrap classes only)  I am using Bootstrap 3.0 dist and I am following some Bootstrap tutorial now, trying to learn how it works. I did everything exactly as in the tutorial (it is for v2, so I changed the classes to v3) and I do not use any custom CSS or anything and in the tutorial the images resize when you simply resize the window, but in mine it stays same and wrecks everything. Also according to the tutorial images should stay centered inside the boxes (the 3 images).
