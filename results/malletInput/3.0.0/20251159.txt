BS 3.0 Sticky Footer with 100% height child divs  I am using the sticky footer method for Bootstrap 3.0 as described in their example. I have it working fine and that is not what I am struggling with.    It calls for the wrapper to have the following:         Now I am trying to have some 100% height containers inside that and I can't because there is a height of auto on the parent. Is there a way to get around this and keep my sticky footer? I want to put 100% height containers that stretch so I can put backgrounds in them.    Thanks
