bs 3.0 sticky footer with 100% height child divs  i am using the sticky footer method for   3.0 as described in their example. i have it working fine and that is not what i am struggling with.    it calls for the wrapper to have the following:         now i am trying to have some 100% height containers inside that and i can't because there is a height of auto on the parent. is there a way to get around this and keep my sticky footer? i want to put 100% height containers that stretch so i can put backgrounds in them.    thanks
