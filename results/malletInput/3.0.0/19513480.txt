customizing   3.0 navbar  i'm using   3.0 and i want to customize the navbar links by changing only the  a  tag, and not the whole  li  .    i want to obtain something like this    , but when i change the background color or borders, the whole .li tag gets the same style.     help?    edit: so far, this is what comes out
