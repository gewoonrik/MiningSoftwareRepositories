Bootstrap Toggle Button works only once when click  I am finding problems in the   navigation menu. When I freshly reload my page, the toggle button works fine i.e. on click it shows the   attribute from the code. Now this works fine for me but I don't want to do like this way as   itself offers "data-target" functionality that actually handles div id on every click.    I am using jquery-1.9.0 and   3.0.0 css and  .js also.
