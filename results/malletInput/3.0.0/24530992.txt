  toggle button works only once when click  i am finding problems in the   navigation menu. when i freshly reload my page, the toggle button works fine i.e. on click it shows the   attribute from the code. now this works fine for me but i don't want to do like this way as   itself offers "data-target" functionality that actually handles div id on every click.    i am using jquery-1.9.0 and   3.0.0 css and  .js also.
