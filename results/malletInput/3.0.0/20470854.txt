how to limit   column width on large devices  i have the following divs that use   3.0 css:         while this looks and behaves the way i want on xs to medium-sized devices, the expanded columns on large devices (>1200px) ruin my design.     is there a way to stop   from expanding column width to 95px on large devices?
