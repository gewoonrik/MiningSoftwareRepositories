removal of   3.0 nav :hover  i kindly need some assistance to help guid me remove the grey border that appears on "mouse hover" for all  attributes.    for an example of this:        you can see that when hovering on each attribute a grey border appears... how do i remove this?    i have traced the issue to the   class- .nav but even after removed all :hover css styles, it's still not going away.
