Removal of Bootstrap 3.0 Nav :hover  I kindly need some assistance to help guid me remove the Grey border that appears on "mouse hover" for all  attributes.    For an example of this:        you can see that when hovering on each attribute a grey border appears... How do I remove this?    I have traced the issue to the   class- .nav but even after removed all :hover css styles, it's still not going away.
