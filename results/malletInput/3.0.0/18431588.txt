Bootstrap 3.0.0 glyphicon-earphone not loading  I have replaced the glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff/eot/svg/ttf files with the latest, but I still can't get the glyphicon-earphone to work. I get a thin rectangle with an open bottom instead. Same goes for glyphicon-phone-alt, but most others work perfectly.    I tried to reproduce the issue on Bootply.com, but it works as expected there. Regardless, here is the link and code.                Is this a bug in Bootstrap 3.0.0? If so - I guess the Bootply site has applied a 'patch/fix' for 3.0.0?
