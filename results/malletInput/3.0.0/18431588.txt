  3.0.0 glyphicon-earphone not loading  i have replaced the glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff/eot/svg/ttf files with the latest, but i still can't get the glyphicon-earphone to work. i get a thin rectangle with an open bottom instead. same goes for glyphicon-phone-alt, but most others work perfectly.    i tried to reproduce the issue on bootply.com, but it works as expected there. regardless, here is the link and code.                is this a bug in   3.0.0? if so - i guess the bootply site has applied a 'patch/fix' for 3.0.0?
