Bootstrap 3.0 Max Column Width: 95px or 97.5px?  If you look at the page:  Boostrap Docs , under the Grid Options heading, there’s a table listing the features of the new grid.     I did a small page with 12 columns (with the class of .col-lg-).     In the table, it says that the ‘Max column with’ is 95px (4th row in the table). However, when I inspected a column, the calculated with is 97.5px, but not 95px.     When I measured the column length in Photoshop, they alternate between 98px and 97px (probably due to rounding up the 77.5px).     Highly appreciate if you guys can explain how this difference comes here? Or, does the   docs refer to something else, when they mention the ‘Max column width’?      (I’m not good with CSS and the grid systems, so apologies if I got something wrong).     Here's the test code I put together:         Thank you.
