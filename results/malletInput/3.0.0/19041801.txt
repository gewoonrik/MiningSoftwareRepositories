Bootstrap 3.0 Sliding Menu from left  I've implemented a sliding menu from left to right in my   3.0 website using  mmenu . However, the performances in Android (samsung galaxy) are not ideal.  I also have a default collapsing menu (nav- dropdown) which perform much better.    I was wondering if any of you guys has a solution to improve the left menu ? Is there any Bootstrap 3.0 component that would do that and be as smooth as the default dropdown ? (couldn't find anything mentioned in the doc) ? or any other recommendation ?
