columns in   3.0 only stacking vertically  a real web design newbie here. i've tried plenty of places online for an answer to this (including here) but to no avail.  i'm trying my hand at a basic grid in   3. my columns only stack vertically, they won't sit side-by-side, and they always resize to fill the browser window. this happens in chrome or firefox on desktop, and the same thing happens on chrome on my mobile devices (7 inch or 4.7 inch).  fyi, i've just been editing with sublime 2 and keeping all the   files under a folder in explorer. not sure if that's relevant.               sorry about the terrible code formatting, it's hard to do this on the only device i have handy while on holiday - my 7 inch tablet!
