How to add time delay and fix position to Bootstrap 3.0 scrollspy?  I'm working on a project with Bootstrap 3.0 and using scrollspy, the scrollspy working good but there is some notes:    1- how to add a time delay when the page scroll or when clicking on one of the links in the navbar to take me to the position i pointed to ?     2- scrollspy position is not correct ( e.g. when i scroll to specific position always i'm above it with about 60px difference ).    thanks
