Image link in Firefox not covering the whole image  I've just noticed a weird bug with Firefox (it works fine with IE and Chrome, all 3 of them at latest version). The brand image is not clickable when the screen is large and the navbar is fully expanded (I can see a few pixels to the left where the click appears, but clicking the image does nothing). But if you resize your screen to have a small width, the navbar collapses and then the link is clickable.    I'm using Bootstrap v3.0.0 for the navbar.    Any ideas? An issue with the padding, or fixed positioning? I couldn't find anything closely similar on the Internet.
