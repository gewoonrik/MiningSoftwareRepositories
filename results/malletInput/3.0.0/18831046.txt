image link in firefox not covering the whole image  i've just noticed a weird bug with firefox (it works fine with ie and chrome, all 3 of them at latest version). the brand image is not clickable when the screen is large and the navbar is fully expanded (i can see a few pixels to the left where the click appears, but clicking the image does nothing). but if you resize your screen to have a small width, the navbar collapses and then the link is clickable.    i'm using   v3.0.0 for the navbar.    any ideas? an issue with the padding, or fixed positioning? i couldn't find anything closely similar on the internet.
