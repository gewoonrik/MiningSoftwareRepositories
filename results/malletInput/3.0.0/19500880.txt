Add spaces between panels in Bootstrap 3.0  I'm using Bootstrap 3.0 and can't seem to figure out how to add padding / space between panels.         I have tried adding a class and setting the width to 30% but it only works if you have two panels and pull the one right. If I add a margin then it throws the responsiveness off and the last cell drops to the next line.    How can I responsively add a gap between the panels?
