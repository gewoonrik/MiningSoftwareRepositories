vertical divider won't work in   3.0  i opened the nav example which comes with the standard   download ( -3.0.0\examples\navbar\index.html) and added vertical dividers between two of the links.    it doesn't seem to make any difference to the navigation bar.         below is a link to how it looks in dreamweaver.
