vertical divider won't work in   3.0  i opened the nav example which comes with the standard   download ( -3.0.0\examples\navbar\index.html) and added vertical dividers between two of the links.    it doesn't seem to make any difference to the navigation bar.      div class="navbar-collapse collapse"   ul class="nav navbar-nav"   li class="active"  a href="#" link1 /a  /li   li  a href="#" link2 /a  /li   li class="divider-vertical"  /li   li  a href="#" link3 /a  /li       below is a link to how it looks in dreamweaver.
