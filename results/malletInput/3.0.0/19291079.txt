  3.0 modal breaking width layout  i'm creating a simple modal in  , nothing modified, simply:          but when the modal opens it's wider than the browser, not matter what size the window is and creates a 20px or so space.         any ideas why this is happening, my layout is based off of the jumbotron template, nothing unique, just color changes mostly.
