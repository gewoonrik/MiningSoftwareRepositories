Bootstrap 3.0 Modal Breaking Width Layout  I'm creating a simple Modal in  , nothing modified, simply:          But when the modal opens it's wider than the browser, not matter what size the window is and creates a 20px or so space.         Any ideas why this is happening, my layout is based off of the Jumbotron template, nothing unique, just color changes mostly.
