centering footer nav links horizontally  for some reason i am unable to center my footer links horizontally. i want my links to be centered, then the "all rights reserved" section underneath that centered as well. i am able to center the "all rights reserved" by applying .center to it but it doesn't affect the list items. any idea what i am missing or doing wrong?    here is my footer partial from my ruby on rails app, i am using   3.0 for styling.      nav class="navbar"       div class="container center"           ul class="nav"               li class="navbar-text"  %= link_to "about", about_path %  /li               li class="navbar-text"  %= link_to "faqs", faq_path %  /li               li class="navbar-text"  %= link_to "contact us", contact_path %  /li               li class="navbar-text"  %= link_to "terms of use   privacy policy", privacy_path %  /li           /ul       /div        div class="container center"           p company 2013. all rights reserved. /p       /div   /nav       the .center is just:     .center {     text-align: center;  }      i tried applying the techniques used from this question:  center a div using   3 markup or css  without any luck in this situation(although this actually helped me resolve another problem i was having)
