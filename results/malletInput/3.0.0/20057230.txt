Centering footer nav links horizontally  For some reason I am unable to center my footer links horizontally. I want my links to be centered, then the "All Rights Reserved" section underneath that centered as well. I am able to center the "All Rights Reserved" by applying .center to it but it doesn't affect the list items. Any idea what I am missing or doing wrong?    Here is my footer partial from my Ruby on Rails app, I am using Bootstrap 3.0 for styling.         I tried applying the techniques used from this question:  center a div using Bootstrap 3 markup or css  without any luck in this situation(Although this actually helped me resolve another problem I was having)
