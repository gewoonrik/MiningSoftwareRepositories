centering footer nav links horizontally  for some reason i am unable to center my footer links horizontally. i want my links to be centered, then the "all rights reserved" section underneath that centered as well. i am able to center the "all rights reserved" by applying .center to it but it doesn't affect the list items. any idea what i am missing or doing wrong?    here is my footer partial from my ruby on rails app, i am using   3.0 for styling.         i tried applying the techniques used from this question:  center a div using   3 markup or css  without any luck in this situation(although this actually helped me resolve another problem i was having)
