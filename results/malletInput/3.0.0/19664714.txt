Responsive navbar not working properly  Trying to get my responsive nav-bar/header to work. But nothing happens when I  click the icon  to show the menu when I'm in mobile sized screen.    To explain it a bit better, I want to do a navbar kinda like this:    .com/components/#navbar     And here's my code:         The only javascript im using is  src=" -3.0.0/dist/js/ .min.js"    Not sure if I need jquery but ive tried with and without it and still nothing happens.
