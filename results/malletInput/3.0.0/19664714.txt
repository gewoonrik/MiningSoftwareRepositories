responsive navbar not working properly  trying to get my responsive nav-bar/header to work. but nothing happens when i  click the icon  to show the menu when i'm in mobile sized screen.    to explain it a bit better, i want to do a navbar kinda like this:    .com/components/#navbar     and here's my code:         the only javascript im using is  src=" -3.0.0/dist/js/ .min.js"    not sure if i need jquery but ive tried with and without it and still nothing happens.
