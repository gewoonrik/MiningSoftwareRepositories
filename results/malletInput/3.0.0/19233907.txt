Bootstrap 3.0 avoid dropdown closing on right-click in FF  I am still unsuccessful in getting   3.0 dropdowns to work as a dropdown should in Firefox. Right clicking a link inside the dropdown in order to open it in a new tab closes the dropdown in FF but works as it should in Chrome and IE. This seems to be an unresolved bug in Bootstrap which has been around for a long time -see    .com/components/#navbar  for a demo. The workaround I have managed below is not satisfactory since it requires toggling the dropdown-toggle link to close the dropdown again, while ideally it should close on a mouse click anywhere outside the dropdown.
