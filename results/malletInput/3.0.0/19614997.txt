  popover 3.0 with tables  when i use   3.0 popover with placement: auto right inside tables it doesn't work, and it flows away from the table size.    placement: auto right (means popover should flow to the right if it has a place otherwise flow to the left)    check this link:           however, when i place it outside a table it works as it's supposed to be!         any idea?
