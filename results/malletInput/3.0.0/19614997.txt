  popover 3.0 with tables  When I use   3.0 popover with placement: auto right inside tables it doesn't work, and it flows away from the table size.    placement: auto right (means popover should flow to the right if it has a place otherwise flow to the left)    Check this link:           However, when I place it outside a table it works as it's supposed to be!         Any idea?
