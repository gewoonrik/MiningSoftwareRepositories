codeigniter-html5boilerplate-twitter-  nav bar problems  Hi I am using the latest version 1.1.3 of codeigniter-html5boilerplate-twitter-  by vesparny. I have been using an older version just fine, but in this version with Bootstrap 3.0 rc1 I am having issues with the navbar. It works in the default header template, but it is not responsive for mobile devices. So I tried to make it so, first of all referring to the   manual, then by copying the navbar src from the   site - I mean that's gotta work right?! Then by copying code from here from replies to folks that have had other navbar issues in BS 3.    The same problem I get no matter what I do is this. On desktop browser all nav links are not visible. On mobile, the collapse button is shown and I click on it and the links drop down as they should, then I click on it again, but it will not go back up. If I then maximize the browser window from mobile size to large desktop, the nav bar remains down and the links visible.             I've spent too long trying to fix this now. Is it an issue with codeigniter-html5boilerplate-twitter- , or BS 3 RC1, or me??!!
