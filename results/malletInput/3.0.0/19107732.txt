codeigniter-html5boilerplate- -  nav bar problems  hi i am using the latest version 1.1.3 of codeigniter-html5boilerplate- -  by vesparny. i have been using an older version just fine, but in this version with   3.0 rc1 i am having issues with the navbar. it works in the default header template, but it is not responsive for mobile devices. so i tried to make it so, first of all referring to the   manual, then by copying the navbar src from the   site - i mean that's gotta work right?! then by copying code from here from replies to folks that have had other navbar issues in bs 3.    the same problem i get no matter what i do is this. on desktop browser all nav links are not visible. on mobile, the collapse button is shown and i click on it and the links drop down as they should, then i click on it again, but it will not go back up. if i then maximize the browser window from mobile size to large desktop, the nav bar remains down and the links visible.      header class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top" role="banner"   div class="container"       div class="navbar-header"           button class="navbar-toggle" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".bs-navbar-collapse"               span class="icon-bar"  /span               span class="icon-bar"  /span               span class="icon-bar"  /span           /button           a href="../" class="navbar-brand"   /a       /div       nav class="collapse navbar-collapse bs-navbar-collapse" role="navigation"           ul class="nav navbar-nav"               li                   a href="../getting-started" getting started /a               /li               li                   a href="../css" css /a               /li               li class="active"                   a href="../components" components /a               /li               li                   a href="../javascript" javascript /a               /li               li                   a href="../customize" customize /a               /li           /ul       /nav   /div           i've spent too long trying to fix this now. is it an issue with codeigniter-html5boilerplate- - , or bs 3 rc1, or me??!!
