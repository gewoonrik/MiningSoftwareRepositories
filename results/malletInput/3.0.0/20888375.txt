properly embedding youtube video into   3.0 page  i need to embed a youtube video into my responsive site but it's not scaling correctly, especially on mobile.  it looks fine on desktop and tablets but once you get below a viewport width of 600, the video breaks its container. to view the whole video on mobile you need to pinch out to a point that the rest of the content only fills about 1/2 the screen vertically. not so good.     i want the text content to be 1/3 wide and the video to be 2/3 wide on desktop and tablets and stacked on mobile with the video and content both 100% of the viewport width. i've tried using width="100%" on the iframe but then the height doesn't scale correctly as you resize and the video either gets stretched or squished.     i also need to do it with css only as i'm simply laying my stylesheets over stock   3.0.    here's my code:       div class="container"                           div class="row"                   div class="col-sm-4" content. this is content, it is not meant to be read or understood. something random goes here, it can be whatever you want, it's just blankish content provided so that it fills up some space, pretty boring huh? /div                   div class="col-sm-8"                      iframe width="600" height="338" src=" " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen  /iframe                   /div    /div
