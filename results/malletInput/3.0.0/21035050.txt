unable to disable the  -3 responsiveness  presently i am working on   3.0 for developing the pages..    i am using the cols-md-* elements for grid view.    while i am trying to disable the responsiveness but it didn't work..    i google it but i didn't found any solution..    i disabled the responsiveness by giving container width to static width (here my width is 1140px)...    and i go through the   link but no luck..    here is my website (   )..
