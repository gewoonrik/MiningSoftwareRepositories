Unable to disable the  -3 responsiveness  Presently i am working on   3.0 for developing the pages..    I am using the cols-md-* elements for grid view.    While i am trying to disable the responsiveness but it didn't work..    i google it but i didn't found any solution..    I disabled the responsiveness by giving container width to static width (Here my width is 1140px)...    And i go through the Bootstrap link but no luck..    Here is my website (   )..
