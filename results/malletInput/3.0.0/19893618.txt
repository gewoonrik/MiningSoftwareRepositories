  3.0 "row" first item not aligned correctly   using   3.0 and the code below is a snip of a  which contains 3 items, each in a  which looks and works well, except the first element in this row (plus others) is shifted slightly above the other elements within the "row." i've attached a screenshot of the issue. i haven't modified the   css to cause any issues.    note: the other rows don't contain asp controls which i thought was the issue but it's not.
