Styles of Bootstrap 3 are different from their own docs examples  This is how the styles of buttons in Bootstrap 3 look in Google Chrome on my own website, using the CDN or downloaded.         And this is how they appear on the Bootstrap documentation site. I don't understand how do to get the new styles. Theirs have no gradient, just a solid flat theme.         The same goes for most of the new Bootstrap 3 styles. I've checked the version on the css files etc, all 3.0.0.     How do I get the new styles?     Cheers,
