styles of   3 are different from their own docs examples  this is how the styles of buttons in   3 look in google chrome on my own website, using the cdn or downloaded.         and this is how they appear on the   documentation site. i don't understand how do to get the new styles. theirs have no gradient, just a solid flat theme.         the same goes for most of the new   3 styles. i've checked the version on the css files etc, all 3.0.0.     how do i get the new styles?     cheers,
