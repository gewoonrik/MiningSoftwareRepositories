typeahead.js does give me suggestions but doesn't select them  i'm using   3.0 and the latest version of typeahead.js with the hogan engine. i managed to get the remote loading of the suggestions to work (finally). now the next hurdle is when a user clicks on a suggestion, how do i make that the word filled in the input? i thought this was probably done automatically but it doesn't for some reason? is this just a basic line of js i'm missing?    the input:      input class="form-control typeahead playername-search"       this is the js:     $(document).ready(function() {      $('.playername-search').typeahead({                                          name: "playername-search",                           remote: '           template: ' p  strong {{short_name}} /strong  â€“ {{rating}} /p ',           engine: hogan                                         }); });      one thing i have to mention, everything is inside a modal. maybe that changes the situation? thanks in advance!
