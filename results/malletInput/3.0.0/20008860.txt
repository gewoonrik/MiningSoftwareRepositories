Typeahead.js does give me suggestions but doesn't select them  I'm using Bootstrap 3.0 and the latest version of Typeahead.js with the Hogan engine. I managed to get the remote loading of the suggestions to work (finally). Now the next hurdle is when a user clicks on a suggestion, how do I make that the word filled in the input? I thought this was probably done automatically but it doesn't for some reason? Is this just a basic line of JS I'm missing?    The input:         One thing I have to mention, everything is inside a modal. Maybe that changes the situation? Thanks in advance!
