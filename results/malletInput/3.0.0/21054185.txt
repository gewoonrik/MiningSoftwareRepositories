Bootstrap 3.0 menu not working on mobile devices  I'm seeing an issue in   3.0 that the navigation menu is not working when the menu is collapsed. To view an example please go here:        I'm starting to think perhaps I have a missing Javascript file or something. I've tested the website on my iPhone5 and also my iPad.  It's working fine when viewing in the browser.    UPDATE: It seems to be working fine on Windows Phones.  Also, only items with dropdowns do not work. Links/buttons without a drop down work.
