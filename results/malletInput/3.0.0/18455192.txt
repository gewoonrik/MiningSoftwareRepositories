  bootsrap 3.0 - tabs-left not working anymore?  i couldn't find an answer to this elsewhere...    in   2.x you could use the js tabs functionality and make them show on the left with:      div class="tabbable tabs-left"   -- tabs-left here!!!   ul class="nav nav-tabs" id="mytab"     li class="active"  a href="#home" home /a  /li     li  a href="#profile" profile /a  /li     li  a href="#messages" messages /a  /li     li  a href="#settings" settings /a  /li   /ul    div class="tab-content"     div class="tab-pane active" id="home" ... /div     div class="tab-pane" id="profile" ... /div     div class="tab-pane" id="messages" ... /div     div class="tab-pane" id="settings" ... /div   /div    /div       but now that functionality doesn't seem to carry over in   3.0 and i don't see any documentation for it on the   website. does anyone know if this was removed? it's hard to believe it would be...    thank you for your help!
