  bootsrap 3.0 - tabs-left not working anymore?  i couldn't find an answer to this elsewhere...    in   2.x you could use the js tabs functionality and make them show on the left with:         but now that functionality doesn't seem to carry over in   3.0 and i don't see any documentation for it on the   website. does anyone know if this was removed? it's hard to believe it would be...    thank you for your help!
