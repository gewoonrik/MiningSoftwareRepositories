Twitter Bootsrap 3.0 - tabs-left not working anymore?  I couldn't find an answer to this elsewhere...    In   2.x you could use the js tabs functionality and make them show on the left with:         But now that functionality doesn't seem to carry over in   3.0 and I don't see any documentation for it on the   website. Does anyone know if this was removed? It's hard to believe it would be...    Thank you for your help!
