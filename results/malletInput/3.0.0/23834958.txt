  3.0 modal doesn't render on mobile  i'm working with the latest version of   for my website (3.x or so) and i'm having some issues with the modals.    the login for my site is written as a modal, and when you click the link for it it will pop up and render 100% correctly on a desktop browser. however, when trying to access that modal on my iphone browser, the modal doesn't generate at all: the link doesn't appear to do anything.    here's what the code for the modal link looks like:       a data-toggle="modal" data-target="#login-box" login /a       here's the modal code itself:      div class="modal fade" id="login-box" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="login-box-title" aria-hidden="true"       div class="modal-dialog"           div class="modal-content"               div class="modal-header"                   button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true" ã— /button                   h4 class="modal-title" id="login-box-title" login /h4               /div               div class="modal-body"                 !-- content of the box goes here --               /div           /div       /div   /div       i'm using the javascript files that were included in my   folder, along with jquery 1.11.0, if that matters.    here's a link to my site:     (most of it is only built out on my local machine, but the login   register functionality works fine).
