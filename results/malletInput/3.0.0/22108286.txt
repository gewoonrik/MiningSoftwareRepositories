Wrong color for flash messages under Rails 4.1 with Bootstrap or Foundation  The following code displays Rails flash messages using Bootstrap 3.0:         For either Bootstrap or Foundation, when I upgrade my application from Rails 4.0 to Rails 4.1, all flash messages appear in red, even "notice" messages which should appear in green.    What's changed in Rails 4.1 to break this code?
