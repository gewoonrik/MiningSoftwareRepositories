can't get simple twitter   modal dialog to popup  I'm trying to get a modal dialog to show by clicking a button.  I'm trying to use  .  My button isn't styled properly (it should be blue, but it's just a link), and the modal dialog doesn't appear when clicking the link.  The screen does turn gray when I click the button.  The sample code for the modal came from the boot strap website.  I'm loading all resources from CDN.  This doesn't seem like it would be difficult.         -modal/bs3.html
