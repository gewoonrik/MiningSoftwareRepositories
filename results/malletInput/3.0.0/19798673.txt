unordered list menu with main content to the left  i want to do some stuff like here at the top under the nav:        i want to make an unordered list to the right with, say about 5   list item, its shown in the left image container.    is it possible to do with   3.0 and some javascript or is it better to write all the stuff by myself, since i prefer a responsive layout style.
