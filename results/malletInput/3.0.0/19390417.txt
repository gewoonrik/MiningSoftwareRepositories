  select display bug  i'm using  silvio moreto's   library  and it's not displaying the select properly.     here is a  screen shot  of the problem.    my guess is i am doing something wrong. i don't know what's causing this issue, but i checked  my javascript load order and that seems fine.     below is the html i execute the code on.      select name="action_type" class='selectpicker'     option value="phone" call /option     option value="email" email /option     option value="url" open to url /option   /select       this is the expanded form after selectpicker() is executed.      div class="btn-group  -select"     button type="button" class="btn dropdown-toggle btn-default" data-toggle="dropdown"       div class="filter-option pull-left" call /div  nbsp;      div class="caret"  /div  /button  div class="dropdown-menu open"       ul class="dropdown-menu inner" role="menu"         li rel="0" class="selected"  a tabindex="0" class="" style=""  span class="text" call /span  i class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok icon-ok check-mark"  /i  /a  /li         li rel="1"  a tabindex="0" class="" style=""  span class="text" email /span  i class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok icon-ok check-mark"  /i  /a  /li         li rel="2"  a tabindex="0" class="" style=""  span class="text" open to url /span  i class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok icon-ok check-mark"  /i  /a  /li       /ul     /div   /div       anyone have any idea what's going on? i presume it could be the css.    update::    i only use certain parts of the   framework because there's a lot that i don't need. i use version 2.3.2 of button, form, and dropdown js/css, but, for some reason, it isn't enough for   selector.     here is a picture using only   3.0 sources from the  test file .    thanks!
