How to use Jquery mobile panels into twitter    I am building a website using twitter   v3.0.0 and i want to add a side-panel (pannel from the right side of the screen), and i found out that i can do that with jquery mobile. The problem is that   just the pannels ? hoping that my css won't be crashed after that?    If yes, please tell me how to do that ! Thanks    Note:     (this is the pannel i like to use)
