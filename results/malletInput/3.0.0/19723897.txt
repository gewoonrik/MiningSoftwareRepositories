how to use jquery mobile panels into      i am building a website using     v3.0.0 and i want to add a side-panel (pannel from the right side of the screen), and i found out that i can do that with jquery mobile. the problem is that  jquery mobile ruins all my css , so my question is :  can i import just a part of jquery mobile ?  just the pannels ? hoping that my css won't be crashed after that?    if yes, please tell me how to do that ! thanks    note:     (this is the pannel i like to use)
