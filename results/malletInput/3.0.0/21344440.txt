migrate   2.3 to 3.0 with .less file  we are currently running   2.3 in our application of over 400 html files. we decided the best way to upgrade to     3.0 without having to change all of our html files would be to include a .less file that references all the changes from 2.3 to 3.0. for example: span6 in 3.0 is now col-md-6. does anyone have a file that embeds all the old properties into a .less file that we could reference?
