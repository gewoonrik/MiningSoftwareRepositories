    3.0 and cakephp 2.4.x  i'm having a tough time getting     on my brand new cakephp installation.    things done so far    -installed and loaded boostcake plugin in appcontroller -i've placed   files/folders in the webroot directory -i've placed jquery 1.9.1 in the webroot/js directory -i've modified default.ctp to load the boostrap and js files.    so far, i created a basic test app with an an add form that grabs today's date for testing, but nothing is showing up. when i view my error log, i get the following routing for the css/js files              solution: apache's mod_rewrite was not working properly. had to reset the apache configuration. thanks for all the help!
