Twitter Bootstrap 3.0 and CakePHP 2.4.x  I'm having a tough time getting Twitter Bootstrap on my brand new cakePHP installation.    Things done so far    -Installed and loaded BoostCake Plugin in AppController -I've placed Bootstrap files/folders in the webroot directory -I've placed jQuery 1.9.1 in the webroot/js directory -I've modified default.ctp to load the boostrap and js files.    So far, I created a basic test app with an an add form that grabs today's date for testing, but nothing is showing up. When I view my error log, I get the following routing for the css/js files              Solution: Apache's mod_rewrite was not working properly. Had to reset the apache configuration. Thanks for all the help!
