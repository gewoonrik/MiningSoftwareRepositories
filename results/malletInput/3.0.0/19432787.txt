Bootstrap 3.0.0 adding extra space on row class  I am using Bootstrap 3.0.0. I am trying to have a row that spans the whole screen (as opposed to putting it in a 'container' where it will be centred with the rest of the content.    For some reason, when I do this, the row adds an extra space to the end of the page, causing the horizontal scroll bar to appear. The space is approximately 5px.    My code looks like this:         I have not made any modifications at all, and no custom CSS. Basically I want to change the background colour of the row, but I want it to span accross the entire page.    Thanks
