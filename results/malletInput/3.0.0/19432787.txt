  3.0.0 adding extra space on row class  i am using   3.0.0. i am trying to have a row that spans the whole screen (as opposed to putting it in a 'container' where it will be centred with the rest of the content.    for some reason, when i do this, the row adds an extra space to the end of the page, causing the horizontal scroll bar to appear. the space is approximately 5px.    my code looks like this:          body           div class="row"               div class="col-xs-6"                  hello              /div               div class="col-xs-6"                  hello              /div           /div       script src="js/ .min.js"  /script   /body       i have not made any modifications at all, and no custom css. basically i want to change the background colour of the row, but i want it to span accross the entire page.    thanks
