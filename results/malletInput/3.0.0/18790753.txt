Fixed Bootstrap navbar to top of dynamic width DIV - not full width of page  My problem    I am using Bootstrap 3.0 and need to use a fixed navbar, which will stay at the top of a DIV on the left side and NOT extend all the way 100% of the width of the window (like I usually see Bootstrap's example do). I have some very simple code below, using ASP.NET MVC 4 which will explain the RenderSection areas.     I have included an image which shows what I am trying to do. Currently the navbar is only extending about 75% of the left side container, not the full 100% of that left side container like I want it to.    Like I said above, I want the navbar to be fixed so when you scroll it stays in one spot within that left DIV.    Any tips/hints would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!    I also saw this question ( Navbar fixed to top but not full-width ) but I do not want to have to dynamically maintain this navbar with a fixed pixel width in media queries. I'd prefer it to fill out the entire left side DIV that contains it.       (     )    My code         But this does  not  work within an iFrame.     If anyone has any insights on solving this for use in an iFrame, it'd be greatly appreciated.
