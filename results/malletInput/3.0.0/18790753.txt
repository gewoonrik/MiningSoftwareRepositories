fixed   navbar to top of dynamic width div - not full width of page  my problem    i am using   3.0 and need to use a fixed navbar, which will stay at the top of a div on the left side and not extend all the way 100% of the width of the window (like i usually see  's example do). i have some very simple code below, using asp.net mvc 4 which will explain the rendersection areas.     i have included an image which shows what i am trying to do. currently the navbar is only extending about 75% of the left side container, not the full 100% of that left side container like i want it to.    like i said above, i want the navbar to be fixed so when you scroll it stays in one spot within that left div.    any tips/hints would be greatly appreciated! thanks!    i also saw this question ( navbar fixed to top but not full-width ) but i do not want to have to dynamically maintain this navbar with a fixed pixel width in media queries. i'd prefer it to fill out the entire left side div that contains it.
