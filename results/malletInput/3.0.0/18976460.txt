navbar collapse not expanding with dropdown after clicking on it  so, i have just started using   3, and i want my header to be fixed at the top, content in it vertically aligned with the content in body, and lastly, responsive.    everything works fine except that clicking on collapsed navbar doesn't seem to work. clicking on those small icon with three bars one over other doesn't show me my list below.     i know this could be a very basic mistake but clicking on this kid right here, doesn't work:         i think i might be doing something wrong with classes in my header.    this is my code:         which are all in my local directory.    searching for "collapse not working"/"collapse click not working" shows me bunch of results which seem to be related to the problem of this icon itself not showing up.    including collapse.js that came with   didn't fix this problem either.
