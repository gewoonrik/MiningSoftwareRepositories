navbar collapse not expanding with dropdown after clicking on it  so, i have just started using   3, and i want my header to be fixed at the top, content in it vertically aligned with the content in body, and lastly, responsive.    everything works fine except that clicking on collapsed navbar doesn't seem to work. clicking on those small icon with three bars one over other doesn't show me my list below.     i know this could be a very basic mistake but clicking on this kid right here, doesn't work:         i think i might be doing something wrong with classes in my header.    this is my code:      header class="navbar  navbar-default navbar-fixed-top" role="banner"   div class="col-10"   div class="container"     div class="navbar-header"       button class="navbar-toggle" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-ex1-collapse"         span class="sr-only" toggle navigation /span         span class="icon-bar"  /span         span class="icon-bar"  /span         span class="icon-bar"  /span       /button         a class="navbar-brand" href="#" logo text /a     /div      nav class="collapse navbar-collapse" role="navigation"       ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"         li class="home_button"   a href="#"   span class="glyphicon glyphicon-home"  /span   /a   /li         li class="dropdown"           a href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown"  b class="caret"  /b  /a           ul class="dropdown-menu"             li   a href="#"   my account  /a   /li  br             li   a href="#"  logout  /a   /li           /ul         /li       /ul     /nav     /div   /div   /header       the only thing i have in my custom css is:     @media (min-width: 980px){     body{         padding-top: 70px;     } }      but i don't think that would be causing this problem.    the things i have included before my header in my html are:      script src="/static/js/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"  /script   script src="/static/js/jquery-migrate-1.2.1.js"  /script   script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/ -3.0.0-min.js"  /script   link href="/static/css/ -3.0.0.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen"   link href="/static/app/bssgame2/css/my_custom.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen"       which are all in my local directory.    searching for "collapse not working"/"collapse click not working" shows me bunch of results which seem to be related to the problem of this icon itself not showing up.    including collapse.js that came with   didn't fix this problem either.
