typeahead.min.js Github link not working  I implemented a search bar dropdown using   v3.0.0 and typeahead.js. At the time of completion of my project(2 months ago). I used the following to include the template engine and typeahead.min.js         which doesn't work since it is upgraded version. Any idea how I can find which version   I'm using. I'm really confused with what is happening and need your help. Thanks.
