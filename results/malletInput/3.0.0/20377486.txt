mvc bundling adds text to  .js  i have an mvc project that includes   3.0.0. on my dev machine everything works fine. but on the test server something goes amiss. i think this has to do with bundling.    dev machine:      is a url and adjusts it for the "new" relative url.    can i tell the bundling not to adjust this javascript file? or do you see another way around this?
