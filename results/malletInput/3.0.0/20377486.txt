mvc bundling adds text to  .js  i have an mvc project that includes   3.0.0. on my dev machine everything works fine. but on the test server something goes amiss. i think this has to do with bundling.    dev machine:     url of page: localhost/mvcproject/page    .js line 1639: var $href = /^#\w/.test(href)    $(href)      test environment:     url of page website.com/blabla/mvcproject/page    .js line 1639: var $href = /blabla/^#\w/.test(href)    $(href)      the boostrap.js does not get changed on my dev machine, but is on the test environment. it thinks  /^#\w/.test(href)  is a url and adjusts it for the "new" relative url.    can i tell the bundling not to adjust this javascript file? or do you see another way around this?
