is there a way to use   3.0 plugins with jquery.noconflict()?  we are currently loading 2 different versions of jquery on our page, 1.4.2 and 1.10.1.  the $ and window.jquery objects are currently pointing to 1.4.2.     we are using noconflict() with version 1.10.1 to set it to $jq1:     var $jq1 = jquery.noconflict(true);      is there any way to get   3.0 plugins to automatically use $jq1 instead of $ or window.jquery?
