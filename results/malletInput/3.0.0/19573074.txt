Is there a way to use   3.0 plugins with jQuery.noConflict()?  We are currently loading 2 different versions of jQuery on our page, 1.4.2 and 1.10.1.  The $ and window.jQuery objects are currently pointing to 1.4.2.     We are using noConflict() with version 1.10.1 to set it to $jq1:         Is there any way to get Bootstrap 3.0 plugins to automatically use $jq1 instead of $ or window.jQuery?
