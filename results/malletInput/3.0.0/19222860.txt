  3.0 typeahead hint pixel mismatch    one    two  resolved question(s) couldn't me help to resolve the pixel-wise not exactly matching input.form-control vs. span.tt-hint issue.     lack of reputation prevents me to further decorate the above, so here is my input on that topic. apologies.     my workaround so far    i somehow had to change the  height  of that portion firstly mentioned  extra css  classes of  . -typeahead .tt-hint { ... }  from  38px  to  34px . now it  works   looks ok .     no idea so far, which inherited css (maybe out of the final bs3) could have caused that. i will have to investigate later...       jquery 1.10.2     v3.0.0   typeahead 0.9.3      ps. early struggles to get it going at all were due to .js file inclusion order. jquery first, more ... stuff,  .js then, typeahead.js afterwards.
