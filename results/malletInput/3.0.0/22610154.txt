Boostrap 3.0 Carousel - different width images  I would like to use the Bootstrap 3.0 Carousel to display an image slider on my webpage. The page is here:        The problem I have is that my images are of different width, but of the same height. What I would like is for the images to stick together...basically the width of the item class should be the same to that of the image...anyone knows how I can do this? The full carousel width should still be 100% of the page, just showing more items than just one
