boostrap 3.0 carousel - different width images  i would like to use the   3.0 carousel to display an image slider on my webpage. the page is here:        the problem i have is that my images are of different width, but of the same height. what i would like is for the images to stick together...basically the width of the item class should be the same to that of the image...anyone knows how i can do this? the full carousel width should still be 100% of the page, just showing more items than just one
