how do i compile     3.0 using windows 8  i am wondering how do i compile     using less on a windows machine? this is the only tutorial i can find, however this failed when installed lessc (saying lessc is not in the npm registry). anyway i was not optimistic this would work since it's for bs2 and not 3.0    how can i compile   3.0 on windows to set the less values?    thanks
