font-awesome icons not displaying correctly in ie8  i am using   in my application to create a navbar. it works great, except when i start adding icons to my dropdown menu which uses font-awesome.    it works in firefox perfectly but it also needs to work in ie8. i search stackoverflow for other solutions and none of them seemed to work in my case.    here is what i get when i load my page:         any help on how to fix this would be great!     here is the font-awesome.css file
