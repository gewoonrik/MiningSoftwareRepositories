Font-Awesome Icons not displaying correctly in IE8  I am using   in my application to create a navbar. It works great, except when I start adding icons to my dropdown menu which uses font-awesome.    It works in Firefox perfectly but it also needs to work in IE8. I search stackoverflow for other solutions and none of them seemed to work in my case.    Here is what I get when I load my page:         Any help on how to fix this would be great!     Here is the Font-awesome.css file
