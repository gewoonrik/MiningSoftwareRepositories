Does Twitter Bootstrap 3.0 offer a slide toggle select component?  I am trying to create a slide toggle select component for a mobile app. We are using twitter   3.0 for the UI.    I don't see any documentation on   3.0 that covers a slide toggle select component. Did they decide not to build that component for 3.0? If so, how can I create one?     I really want to keep using Bootstrap 3.0 for the responsive design elements. And I don't want to weigh my app down by adding jQuery mobile.
