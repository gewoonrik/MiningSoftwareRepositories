does     3.0 offer a slide toggle select component?  i am trying to create a slide toggle select component for a mobile app. we are using     3.0 for the ui.    i don't see any documentation on   3.0 that covers a slide toggle select component. did they decide not to build that component for 3.0? if so, how can i create one?     i really want to keep using   3.0 for the responsive design elements. and i don't want to weigh my app down by adding jquery mobile.
