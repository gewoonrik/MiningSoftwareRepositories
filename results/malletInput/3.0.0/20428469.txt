zend framework 1.12 +     3.0.2  is there any workaround to decorate zf 1.12 forms with   >= 3.0.0 ? i tried   -zend-framework  and  easybib . none of them work properly. i think they both generate   2 forms.    if there is no ready to use decorator or modules, i would like to modify on of old codes or write my own decorator.
