how to code a div of buttons to be   responsive?  i am using   3.0 to code my website. so i have this navigation area that is made up of 6 buttons running horizontally across the page. however, i would like to make this navigation area turn into a bar with a menu icon on the side once the user resizes the browser or is viewing the website on a smaller screen such as tablet and mobile.     how would i code this so that it will turn into navigation bar with a menu icon when viewwed on smaller devices. should i change this area into an actual navigation bar div using "nav" and "ul" and such? and then code the "li" to look like buttons?    html
