How to code a div of buttons to be Bootstrap responsive?  I am using Bootstrap 3.0 to code my website. So I have this navigation area that is made up of 6 buttons running horizontally across the page. However, I would like to make this navigation area turn into a bar with a menu icon on the side once the user resizes the browser or is viewing the website on a smaller screen such as tablet and mobile.     How would I code this so that it will turn into navigation bar with a menu icon when viewwed on smaller devices. Should I change this area into an actual navigation bar div using "nav" and "ul" and such? And then code the "li" to look like buttons?    HTML
