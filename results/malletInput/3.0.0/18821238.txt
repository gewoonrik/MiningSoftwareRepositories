Multiple Collapse buttons in navbar with Bootstrap 3.0  I'm using Bootstrap 3.0 to show a navbar with some links and a search field. When i go to "mobile version" i have a button that collapses the navbar and show all the content: the links and the search field. Now I need two buttons, one to collapse only the links of the navbar and the other button to collapse only the search field. How can i make this?
