multiple collapse buttons in navbar with   3.0  i'm using   3.0 to show a navbar with some links and a search field. when i go to "mobile version" i have a button that collapses the navbar and show all the content: the links and the search field. now i need two buttons, one to collapse only the links of the navbar and the other button to collapse only the search field. how can i make this?
