How to add multiple email ids into a text field (like facebook privacy setting) and convert the email id list into comma separated list?  I'm using  PHP, jQuery(jquery-1.9.1.min.js and jquery-ui-1.10.0.custom.min.js), Bootstap framework(Bootstrap v3.0.0), AJAX,  etc. for my website.     Now at one place I want user to be able to enter multiple email ids into a HTML textfield. It should happen like facebook privacy setting. Following is the screenshot of what I expect to achieve.         From the above image I want the text field to behave like from the "Don't share this with" section. The only difference is here names are getting displayed and I want to add email ids. No auto populate functionality is needed like facebook.    When user will submit the form then the comma separated list of entered email ids should be sent to the respective method.    Can someone please help me in this regard please? Thank you so much for spending some of your valuable time in understanding my issue. Any kind of help, comment, answer would be of great use use to me.    Waiting for your precious replies. Thanks in advance.    If you need any further information regarding my issue, please do let me know.
