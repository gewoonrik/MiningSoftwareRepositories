full width submenu in   3 without using megamenu  i have a simple top-fixed nav using   3.0 which utilizes the submenu feature.  i'm attempting to have my submenu take up the full width of the container, not just the width of the combined submenu elements.  the problem appears to be coming from the      so far the closest solution i've come across is adding a container within the dropdown menu, however i'm still unable to extend the dropdown menu beyond it's ~160px width.    the general goal is to have a full-width dropdown menu.  currently not worried about what it looks like on mobile devices.    thanks
