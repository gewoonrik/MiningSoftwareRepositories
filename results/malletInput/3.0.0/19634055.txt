Vertically center Bootstrap Carousel image captions  Is it possible to center the captions in Bootstrap 3.0 vertically?    Here's a screenshot of how it looks now        So that the captions, all the text, is in the middle of the picture? Here's my HTML code:         None of them worked they simply didn't center the captions.    I'm now working a day just on centering the text and somehow have the impression that it's embarrassingly easy but I just can't figure out how to do it.
