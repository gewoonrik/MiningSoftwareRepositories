vertically center   carousel image captions  is it possible to center the captions in   3.0 vertically?    here's a screenshot of how it looks now        so that the captions, all the text, is in the middle of the picture? here's my html code:         none of them worked they simply didn't center the captions.    i'm now working a day just on centering the text and somehow have the impression that it's embarrassingly easy but i just can't figure out how to do it.
