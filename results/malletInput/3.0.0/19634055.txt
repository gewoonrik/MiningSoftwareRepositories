vertically center   carousel image captions  is it possible to center the captions in   3.0 vertically?    here's a screenshot of how it looks now        so that the captions, all the text, is in the middle of the picture? here's my html code:      div id="mycarousel" class="carousel slide"     !-- indicators --     ol class="carousel-indicators"       li data-target="#mycarousel" data-slide-to="0" class="active"  /li       li data-target="#mycarousel" data-slide-to="1"  /li       li data-target="#mycarousel" data-slide-to="2"  /li     /ol     div class="carousel-inner"       div class="item active"         img src="images/slide01.jpg" alt="first slide"           div class="carousel-caption"             h1 welcome /h1             p here you'll see a great text! /p           /div       /div       div class="item"         img src="images/slide02.jpg" alt="second slide"         div class="container"           div class="carousel-caption"             h1 great caption /h1             p so, this will be a great text as well. /p           /div         /div       /div       div class="item"         img src="images/slide03.jpg" alt="third slide"         div class="container"           div class="carousel-caption"             h1 one more /h1             p once again you'll see a great text here, seriously it'll be awesome! /p           /div         /div       /div     /div     a class="left carousel-control" href="#mycarousel" data-slide="prev"  span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"  /span  /a     a class="right carousel-control" href="#mycarousel" data-slide="next"  span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"  /span  /a   /div       my css file is pretty stock (changed nothing):     .carousel {   margin-bottom: 60px;  /* negative margin to pull up carousel. 90px is roughly margins and height of navbar. */   margin-top: -20px; }  /* since positioning the image, we need to help out the caption */ .carousel-caption {   z-index: 10; }  /* declare heights because of positioning of img element */ .carousel .item {   min-height: 200px;   background-color: #777; } .carousel-inner   .item   img {   width: 100%;   display: block;   max-width: 100%; }      i just can't get this to work, already tried:    - -carousel-image-captions/19623418#19623418 ,   3-carousel-with-flexbox ,   ,       none of them worked they simply didn't center the captions.    i'm now working a day just on centering the text and somehow have the impression that it's embarrassingly easy but i just can't figure out how to do it.
