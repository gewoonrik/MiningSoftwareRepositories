knockout js - containerless control breaks foreach using template  apologies for the long winded title. hopefully some code will make things clearer.    before i begin, i am using knockoutjs version 3.0.0,   3 and jquery 1. 7.1. this issue is related to knockoutjs.    i have the following html which creates a form based upon my underlying javascript model.         hopefully someone could shed some light on why i am seeing this odd behaviour.    let me know if there is anything else i can add to help identify the issue.
