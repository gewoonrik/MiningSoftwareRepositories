Knockout JS - Containerless Control Breaks Foreach using Template  Apologies for the long winded title. Hopefully some code will make things clearer.    Before I begin, I am using KnockoutJs version 3.0.0,   3 and jquery 1. 7.1. This issue is related to KnockoutJS.    I have the following html which creates a form based upon my underlying javascript model.         Hopefully someone could shed some light on why I am seeing this odd behaviour.    Let me know if there is anything else I can add to help identify the issue.
