Link  .css file to scala.html page in Play framework  I have a  .css file located at        C:\Users\comp\Play_Framework\test1\public\stylesheets\ .css      I need to link this to my Login page located at        C:\Users\comp\Play_Framework\test1\app\views\cal_login.scala.html      I have tried this in my HTML page        link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="..../public/stylesheets/ .css"      and also        link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../../public/stylesheets/ .css"      but the page still looks without css content.Moreover, when I open Play 2.2.2 Project in eclipse the I can't find my   file. I have compiled and tried reopening but the file is just not getting compiled and added to the stylesheet directory.
