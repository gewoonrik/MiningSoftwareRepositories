    - image classes not applying?  i am using     2.2.2 and the latest version of chrome. i was reading about  images  and decided to try out the img-rounded, -circle and -polaroid classes on some test images to see what they would look like.    problem is as you can see from  this example page  the images are not rounded, not a circle and poorly polaroided....    any tips?
