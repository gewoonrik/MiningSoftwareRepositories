Twitter Bootstrap Broken Dropdown  I have had a website running   for quite a while now (since 2.2 ish). I recently have been trying to patch up the page after noticing that the drop-down bar was no longer functional. This was odd as it had been tested before and no issues arised approximately a year ago.    I have tried swapping out parts of the HTML with some of the newer   examples for the past few hours, but I can't appear to get the drop-down to work anymore.    For debugging, I have isolated the problem to its simplest case with the HTML below.         Any ideas about what I might be missing would be very much appreciated. I believe it might be a mismatch between the versions of Bootstrap that are causing this issue. However, I am trying to refactor as little HTML as possible to get the dropdown working as I am no longer familiar with this older code.    Ultimately, I'm trying to fix this bug without migrating from 2.2.2.
