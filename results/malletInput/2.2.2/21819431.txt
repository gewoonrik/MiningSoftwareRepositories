    broken dropdown  i have had a website running   for quite a while now (since 2.2 ish). i recently have been trying to patch up the page after noticing that the drop-down bar was no longer functional. this was odd as it had been tested before and no issues arised approximately a year ago.    i have tried swapping out parts of the html with some of the newer   examples for the past few hours, but i can't appear to get the drop-down to work anymore.    for debugging, i have isolated the problem to its simplest case with the html below.      !doctype html   html lang="en"     head        link href="  cdn.com/ - /2.2.2/css/ -combined.min.css" rel="stylesheet"      /head      body         div class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top"         div class="navbar-inner"           div class="container"             a class="btn btn-navbar" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".nav-collapse"               span class="icon-bar"  /span               span class="icon-bar"  /span               span class="icon-bar"  /span             /a             div class="brand" test /div             div class="nav-collapse collapse"               ul class="nav"                 li class="dropdown"                   a href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" dropdown  b class="caret"  /b  /a                   ul class="dropdown-menu"                     li  a href="#" action /a  /li                     li  a href="#" another action /a  /li                     li  a href="#" something else here /a  /li                     li class="divider"  /li                     li class="dropdown-header" nav header /li                     li  a href="#" separated link /a  /li                     li  a href="#" one more separated link /a  /li                   /ul                 /li                 /ul             /div  !--/.nav-collapse --           /div         /div       /div          !-- placed at the end of the document so the pages load faster --       script src=" " type="text/javascript"  /script       script type="text/javascript" src="http:// .github.com/ /assets/js/ .js"  /script       script type="text/javascript" src="http:// .github.com/ /assets/js/ .min.js"  /script       script type="text/javascript" src="http:// .github.com/ /assets/js/ -dropdown.js"  /script       /body   /html       any ideas about what i might be missing would be very much appreciated. i believe it might be a mismatch between the versions of   that are causing this issue. however, i am trying to refactor as little html as possible to get the dropdown working as i am no longer familiar with this older code.    ultimately, i'm trying to fix this bug without migrating from 2.2.2.
