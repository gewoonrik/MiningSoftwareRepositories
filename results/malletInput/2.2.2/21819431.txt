    broken dropdown  i have had a website running   for quite a while now (since 2.2 ish). i recently have been trying to patch up the page after noticing that the drop-down bar was no longer functional. this was odd as it had been tested before and no issues arised approximately a year ago.    i have tried swapping out parts of the html with some of the newer   examples for the past few hours, but i can't appear to get the drop-down to work anymore.    for debugging, i have isolated the problem to its simplest case with the html below.         any ideas about what i might be missing would be very much appreciated. i believe it might be a mismatch between the versions of   that are causing this issue. however, i am trying to refactor as little html as possible to get the dropdown working as i am no longer familiar with this older code.    ultimately, i'm trying to fix this bug without migrating from 2.2.2.
