collapsing a     drop-down menu as soon as a menu item is clicked  i have a     drop-down menu with ajax links(i.e links with  ). when i click on a link, the menu remains open until the ajax call is complete. is there a way to collapse the menu as soon as a user clicks on a link?    here is a jsfiddle  sample  to demonstrate the problem. (please overlook the fact that i am freezing the thread in the sample code. i wanted to simulated scenario with few lines of code.)     note:  i am using     v 2.2.2.
