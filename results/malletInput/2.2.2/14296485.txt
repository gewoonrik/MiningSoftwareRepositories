Collapsing a Twitter   drop-down menu as soon as a menu item is clicked  I have a twitter   drop-down menu with AJAX links(i.e links with  ). When I click on a link, the menu remains open until the AJAX call is complete. Is there a way to collapse the menu as soon as a user clicks on a link?    Here is a jsFiddle  sample  to demonstrate the problem. (Please overlook the fact that I am freezing the thread in the sample code. I wanted to simulated scenario with few lines of code.)     Note:  I am using Twitter   v 2.2.2.
