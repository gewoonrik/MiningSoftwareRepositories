Grails: Including JQuery Autocomplete in Twitter Bootstrap  i am working on a webapplication using Twitter Bootstrap 2.2.2.    I am trying to include JQuery autocomplete for multiple values:        This is on order to allow the user to make multiple selections from a hasMany relationship between two domain classes.     I have tested the jquery autocomplete in a new grails project without   and it works perfectly.    However as soon as i include it into my project and add the   layout to the view in the header, the styling of the textfield is altered and the autocomplete function does not work anymore.    I therefore believe that it is related to the   styling of the textfield, but i dont know how to solve this issue.    Any help would be greatly appreciated.
