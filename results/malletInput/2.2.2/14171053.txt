grails: including jquery autocomplete in      i am working on a webapplication using     2.2.2.    i am trying to include jquery autocomplete for multiple values:        this is on order to allow the user to make multiple selections from a hasmany relationship between two domain classes.     i have tested the jquery autocomplete in a new grails project without   and it works perfectly.    however as soon as i include it into my project and add the   layout to the view in the header, the styling of the textfield is altered and the autocomplete function does not work anymore.    i therefore believe that it is related to the   styling of the textfield, but i dont know how to solve this issue.    any help would be greatly appreciated.
