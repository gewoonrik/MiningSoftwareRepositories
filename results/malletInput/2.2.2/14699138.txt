spacing issues with dynamically generated   elements  i'm working with     2.2.2 and jquery 1.7.2 trying to use anchors with a flat button style as tags. such tags are dynamically added after saving a text input; i'm using a very simple html structure:       p       a class="btn btn-small"  span tag 1 /span  /a       a class="btn btn-small"  span tag 2 /span  /a   /p       with jquery i just create a new a with the required attributes and values, and it is then attached to the paragraph.    however, whenever you create more than 1, the spacing between elements gets all messed up and new tags are created without spacing between them.     i created the following fiddle to demo my problem:        click add tag more than 2 times and you'll see the problem...    is there a way to fix the spacing with the dynamically generated elements?    thanks, marcelo c.
