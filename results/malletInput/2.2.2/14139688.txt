is it possible to host    .css in google just like jquery?       possible duplicate:      hosted version of     (maybe google?)           as of now i'm loading my jquery  from google  like this.      script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js"  /script           is the  most popular project  in github. i think its getting popular day by day and i'm pretty sure   used by many sites.     if there is a centralised api to load  , the page will obviously load faster because it could potentially already be cached in client's browser just like jquery.    something like this      link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http:// . .com/2.2.2/ .min.css" /   script src="// . .com/2.2.2/ .min.js"  /script       is it possible?
