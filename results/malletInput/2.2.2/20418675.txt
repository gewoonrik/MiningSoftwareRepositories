issue with multi tier drop down menu for wordpress on mobile devices using Bootstrap v2.2.2  I am trying to get the multi-tier dropdown to function correctly but can't seem to get it to work. What happens is I am able to click on the drop down and it appears. When I click a menu item to open the second tier, it flashes and then collapses. Also, any link that I click on in any of the dropdowm menus do not work.    You can see this in action here:        I've developed the site using the Septimus theme from ThemeForest which utilizes   v2.2.2.     One modification I made to ensure that the site is always viewed the same as the desktop version was by putting this line in the head code:         The theme (or  ) comes with a mobile menu, so I'm assuming that since it's not utilized here there may not have been proper styling for it?    Any help would be appreciated!
