issue with multi tier drop down menu for wordpress on mobile devices using   v2.2.2  i am trying to get the multi-tier dropdown to function correctly but can't seem to get it to work. what happens is i am able to click on the drop down and it appears. when i click a menu item to open the second tier, it flashes and then collapses. also, any link that i click on in any of the dropdowm menus do not work.    you can see this in action here:        i've developed the site using the septimus theme from themeforest which utilizes   v2.2.2.     one modification i made to ensure that the site is always viewed the same as the desktop version was by putting this line in the head code:         the theme (or  ) comes with a mobile menu, so i'm assuming that since it's not utilized here there may not have been proper styling for it?    any help would be appreciated!
