  responsive fix on small tablet & phones  i use   2.2.2 and have the following html markup.         this markup works fine on desktop, when i resize the viewport (e.g. iphone) boxes are smaller as expected, but right margin becomes removed. there is only left margin. i want the left and right margin to be aligned.    how to solve this issue?
