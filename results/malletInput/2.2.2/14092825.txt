almost all of   styling not working in ie8. works fine in chrome and firefox  i'm working on a classic .asp site and am using   for styling.  everything is working fine in chrome and firefox, but almost all of the styling is missing in ie8.    i'm using  s carousel and modal and none of them are looking like they should. the carousel is just rendered as a series of images and none of the back/forward buttons are working.     the modal isn't styled at all, and is just inserted on the page as a "box" with a border" (no backdrop, rounded corners or anything).    i've tried a few more of the   library styles, such as tables and buttons and nothing looks like it should.  i know that the  .css gets included as some of the styling works (e.g button colors). the   js works fine.    is there anything additionally that i need to add to my html docs (doc types or what not) to make   work as it should in ie?    i'm using   v2.2.2    thanks in advance!
