Almost all of   styling not working in IE8. Works fine in chrome and firefox  I'm working on a classic .asp site and am using   for styling.  Everything is working fine in chrome and firefox, but almost all of the styling is missing in IE8.    I'm using  s carousel and modal and none of them are looking like they should. The carousel is just rendered as a series of images and none of the back/forward buttons are working.     The modal isn't styled at all, and is just inserted on the page as a "box" with a border" (no backdrop, rounded corners or anything).    I've tried a few more of the   library styles, such as tables and buttons and nothing looks like it should.  I know that the  .css gets included as some of the styling works (e.g button colors). The   js works fine.    Is there anything additionally that I need to add to my html docs (doc types or what not) to make   work as it should in IE?    I'm using   v2.2.2    Thanks in advance!
