Very strange 'stack level too deep' problems on ' ' related gems  I've been stuck on this error for weeks.    When I trying to include   gems in my application.css file, it MIGHT give the error of "Stack level too deep"    From what I googled pointed out the root issue of this was because of double defined method "image_url" both in sprockets and  -sass.    Here's my error log:         Now, I have updated  -sass to the latest version and the error gone for a while... Next time I do "bundle install", the error poped up again. I also tried the different   gem: "anjlab- " the results are the same.    The strangest thing is:    I was trying to reproduce this error by creating a new empty rails app and use the same Gemfile, as a matter of fact, I copied almost every files to the new projects includes "app", "config", "lib", "public", "Gemfile" and "Gemfile.lock"    And no error in the new project. I happily push the new project to Github. Next day, when I on my office computer, I git clone the new project, do the bundle install. And guess what.... the same error poped up AGAIN.    Here my repo(the new and should be working) for the reference    git@github.com:jasonlu/drwho.git    I'm thinking the problem might be on my rvm. I have also tried to reinstall entire rvm and got no luck.    Could anyone help?
