Less does not compile files with Twitter Bootstrap  I am having weird issues working with less files and Twitter Bootstrap:    I have already had a deep investigation but i am still facing the problems.    I have downloaded the last versions of less and Twitter Bootstrap and i have organized my files in this way:     .less     , but these variables are set up in my variables.less and the files  .less and variables.less are loaded successfully. I upload a print screen to explain better my case     What might be causing the problem?    Thanks for your patience and i hope you get the point of my issue
