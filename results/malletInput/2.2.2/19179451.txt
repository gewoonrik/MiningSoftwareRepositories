50% cpu usage when using     carousel animation  i'm using rails 3 with      2.2.2 . i've bought a theme from  wrap   and i want to use it on front end.    however, i have some strange cpu usage issues when   carousel animation is turned on, the page is scrolled to bottom and you switch to other pages. strangely, if you switch back to the website, the usage becomes normal.    here's my page:        to replicate:        open the page   scroll to the bottom   switch to another tab(but not close the my app's tab)   check cpu usage from chrome task manager      i don't know what it can be but it's something with the animation functions of the carousel. please take a look.    thanks for your help
