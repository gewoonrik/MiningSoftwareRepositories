strange behaviour of the   button on focus into pagination  i use   v2.2.2     and this is my button:      div class="pagination "        ul           li             a href="" class="btn btn-success btn-large"                 i class="icon-fast-forward"  /i            /a           /li         /ul      /div       however, when i try to focus on button i get strange behavior of colors:    demo in  fiddle     the fix is to remove  pagination  class or   ul   tag     how can i fix it?    thank you,    (** comment : i'm not interesting to use   3.0)
