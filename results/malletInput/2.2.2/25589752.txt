layout issue w-  .js v2.2.2  i have a prototype web site using  .js. i may have broken some assumptions   uses. for example, all my images at the top of the page are 1000px wide.    everything seemed to work ok, then when i upgraded to v2.2.2, the navbar with 6 items wraps the 6th item onto a second line.    here's the navbar code:         can you spot any glaring mistakes? can   work with 1000px images, or do i need to reformat for 960px?    thanks,    joe
