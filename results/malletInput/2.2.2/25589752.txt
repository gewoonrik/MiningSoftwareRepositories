Layout issue w- Bootstrap.js V2.2.2  I have a prototype web site using  .js. I may have broken some assumptions   uses. For example, all my images at the top of the page are 1000px wide.    Everything seemed to work ok, then when I upgraded to v2.2.2, the navbar with 6 items wraps the 6th item onto a second line.    Here's the navbar code:         Can you spot any glaring mistakes? Can   work with 1000px images, or do I need to reformat for 960px?    Thanks,    Joe
