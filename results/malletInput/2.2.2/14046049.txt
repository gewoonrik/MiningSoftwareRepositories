button dropdown links don't work on mobile (android, ios)     / /issues/4550     this issue says it's fixed; i uploaded  .js 2.2.2 and it still doesn't work.    is there additional code or files that need to be written?    the dropup doesn't work on an ipad.    i saw the previous stack overflow questions and work arounds. but since this issue is supposed to be fixed in 2.2.2 i don't want to be adding code that's not necessary.
