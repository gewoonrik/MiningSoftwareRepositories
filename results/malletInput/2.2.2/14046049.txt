Button dropdown links don't work on mobile (android, iOS)     /issues/4550     This issue says it's fixed; I uploaded  .js 2.2.2 and it still doesn't work.    Is there additional code or files that need to be written?    The dropup doesn't work on an iPad.    I saw the previous Stack Overflow questions and work arounds. But since this issue is supposed to be fixed in 2.2.2 I don't want to be adding code that's not necessary.
