How to remove background color from list items on a twitter   button dropdown menu?  I am struggling with the button dropdowns, I cannot remove the blue background color that appears when hovering through the menu list items. I tried changing the a:hover CSS but with no success. Maybe this background color is dinamically added with javascript?    Thanks!     Edit :    I tried this code and no success:         It looks like the CSS background color is not applied to the  element. Why?
