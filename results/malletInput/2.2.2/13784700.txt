how to remove background color from list items on a     button dropdown menu?  i am struggling with the button dropdowns, i cannot remove the blue background color that appears when hovering through the menu list items. i tried changing the a:hover css but with no success. maybe this background color is dinamically added with javascript?    thanks!     edit :    i tried this code and no success:         it looks like the css background color is not applied to the  element. why?
