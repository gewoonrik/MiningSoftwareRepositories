rails  -sass do i need to update   files?  I am using ROR with  -sass gem. It is quite strange, but I can't use some of stylings that are listed here:    /components.html#labels-badges     I thought it is because of my not actual  -sass gem - it was 2.0. So I updated this gem to 2.2.2.0, it installed well, but it didn't help.    As I checked the stylesheet files in source of my page, on top of localhost/assets/custom.css?body=1, there is header:    /*  * Bootstrap 2.0.0  * (...)    So do I need to update   files separately? And if, where I can find them?    EDIT    I made some actions: -downloaded   by hand and put it to vendor/assets/stylesheets/  (I created the   folder) -changed import " " to import " / "    it worked, but I had objections if it is a good practise, so I made: -gem clean -gem update -bundle install -deleted the vendor/assets/stylesheets/  - everything what I put -changed back to import " " and... it seems to work.
