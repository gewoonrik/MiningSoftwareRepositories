rails  -sass do i need to update   files?  i am using ror with  -sass gem. it is quite strange, but i can't use some of stylings that are listed here:  http:// .github.com/ /components.html#labels-badges     i thought it is because of my not actual  -sass gem - it was 2.0. so i updated this gem to 2.2.2.0, it installed well, but it didn't help.    as i checked the stylesheet files in source of my page, on top of localhost/assets/custom.css?body=1, there is header:    /*  *   2.0.0  * (...)    so do i need to update   files separately? and if, where i can find them?    edit    i made some actions: -downloaded   by hand and put it to vendor/assets/stylesheets/  (i created the   folder) -changed import " " to import " / "    it worked, but i had objections if it is a good practise, so i made: -gem clean -gem update -bundle install -deleted the vendor/assets/stylesheets/  - everything what i put -changed back to import " " and... it seems to work.
