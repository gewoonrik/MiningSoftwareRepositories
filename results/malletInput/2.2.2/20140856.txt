Layout width different between localhost and server  I would like to understand, if possible, why a standard layout with Bootstrap v2.2.2 created in localhost with WAMP, I have a width of .container{} of 1170px (@ media (min-width: 1200px)), while the exact same layout uploaded to the server (LAMP) I have .container{} 940px wide.    None of you has encountered a similar problem??! Maybe linux interprets different css than windows? (Sounds stupid)
