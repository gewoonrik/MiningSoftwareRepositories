layout width different between localhost and server  i would like to understand, if possible, why a standard layout with   v2.2.2 created in localhost with wamp, i have a width of .container{} of 1170px (@ media (min-width: 1200px)), while the exact same layout uploaded to the server (lamp) i have .container{} 940px wide.    none of you has encountered a similar problem??! maybe linux interprets different css than windows? (sounds stupid)
