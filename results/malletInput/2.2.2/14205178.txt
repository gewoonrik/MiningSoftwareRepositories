Collapsible navigation bar issues  I'm trying to create a navigation bar similar to  Bootstrap . If you go to their site and re-size your browser. if you re-size it narrow enough, the top navigation bar will become a button. when you click on the button, it pushes everything down and displays the full navigation again.    That's what I'm trying to accomplish with this  jsfiddle , but it has the following issues:      initially, the button is not hidden, it should be hidden and only be visible when the screen gets too narrow.   (fixed) the button doesn't display background like   does   (fixed) re-size browser to make navigation disappear and click on the button. then click on sub menu, the sub menu items does not display well.      issue 1 screen prints:    nav bar should not be visible yet because browser width is larger than 940px      nav bar appears, it's fine because browser width is less than 940px       full html code:
