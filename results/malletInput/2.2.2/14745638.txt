no scrolling image background on a fixed height container  I'm using Twitter Bootstrap 2.2.2. I have a container with a fixed height (based on user window height) and scrollbar-y activated for it.    The problem is coming from the container's image background: it's acting as fixed even if i have set it up as scroll.    Here is my CSS:         And a  jsFiffle     What's wrong with my code?    Thanks for your help!    EDIT: When I unset height for #row1, my background is scrolling correctly...
