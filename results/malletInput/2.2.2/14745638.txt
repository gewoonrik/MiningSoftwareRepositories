no scrolling image background on a fixed height container  i'm using     2.2.2. i have a container with a fixed height (based on user window height) and scrollbar-y activated for it.    the problem is coming from the container's image background: it's acting as fixed even if i have set it up as scroll.    here is my css:         and a  jsfiffle     what's wrong with my code?    thanks for your help!    edit: when i unset height for #row1, my background is scrolling correctly...
