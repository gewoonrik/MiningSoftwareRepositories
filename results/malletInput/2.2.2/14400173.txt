Bootstrap: Is popover broken in version 2.2.2?  I have updated to the latest 2.2.2 version of   and it seems manual triggering of popovers are broken:    here is  fiddle  to proof it.    Once you click on the button, check your console it says:      is undefined.    Can anyone else confirm this? then I could submit a bug. Thanks
