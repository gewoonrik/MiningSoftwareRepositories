 : is popover broken in version 2.2.2?  i have updated to the latest 2.2.2 version of   and it seems manual triggering of popovers are broken:    here is  fiddle  to proof it.    once you click on the button, check your console it says:     typeerror: e is undefined      in   line 1010:     toggle: function (e) {   var self = $(e.currenttarget)[this.type](this._options).data(this.type)   self[self.tip().hasclass('in') ? 'hide' : 'show']() }       it seems  e  is undefined.    can anyone else confirm this? then i could submit a bug. thanks
