  tooltip-popover v2.2.2  i am having a problem with using   v 2.2.2 and tooltip-popover functions.    the effect i wish to achieve is for a popup to appear when the box is hovered over as show in the link below.       - /popover-example.html      the problem is that the code provided does not seem to work with v2.2.2. i believe the problem maybe that in the latest version these files      script src="js/ -tooltip.js"  /script     script src="js/ -popover.js"  /script       do not exist. i have read the documentation and almost every other thread and tutorial however i cannot seem to work out how to make it work.    any help would be greatful
