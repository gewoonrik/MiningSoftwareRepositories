Bootstrap Tooltip-Popover v2.2.2  I am having a problem with using   v 2.2.2 and tooltip-popover functions.    The effect I wish to achieve is for a popup to appear when the box is hovered over as show in the link below.       /popover-example.html      The problem is that the code provided does not seem to work with v2.2.2. I believe the problem maybe that in the latest version these files         Do not exist. I have read the documentation and almost every other thread and tutorial however I cannot seem to work out how to make it work.    Any help would be greatful
