  carousel not displaying indicators and list not working  i'm using a   carousel ( *  -carousel.js v2.2.2). the problem is, the style of the 'ol' which contains the carousel-indicators isn't working. when i add the style manually to my css file it is displaying, but it doesn't seem to change when the .active class changes from slide to slide.    my code is:         so it seems the jquery isn't working that well too.. but the slides work and the prev/next does too when i add it..
