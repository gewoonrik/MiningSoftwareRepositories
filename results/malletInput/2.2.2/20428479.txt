Combining div classes and my image map  Using Bootstrap v2.2.2    I'm trying to apply an image map into my span 4 class, except the image map class is knocking the alignment out (it seems to be breaking out of the container or row class and not scaling the image in the responsive breakpoints). I'm a designer by trade so i lack the expertise in CSS that i think this needs.  There is a clash of code somewhere!     This is what i have done:         CSS:         .map_image { display: block; width: 360px; height: 182px; position: relative; background-position: 0 0; background-repeat: no-repeat; }     .map_image .map_link { display: block; position: absolute; text-indent: -999em; overflow: hidden; }     .map_image #map_link_0 { width: 78px; height: 81px; top: 7px; left: 1px; }     .map_image #map_link_1 { width: 77px; height: 82px; top: 8px; left: 91px; }     .map_image #map_link_2 { width: 98px; height: 78px; top: 9px; left: 175px; }     .map_image #map_link_3 { width: 73px; height: 75px; top: 10px; left: 284px; }     .map_image #map_link_4 { width: 72px; height: 81px; top: 98px; left: 1px; }     .map_image #map_link_5 { width: 105px; height: 81px; top: 99px; left: 81px; }     .map_image #map_link_6 { width: 71px; height: 81px; top: 99px; left: 193px; }     .map_image #map_link_7 { width: 85px; height: 78px; top: 99px; left: 272px; }
