    glyphicons partial opacity in ie8 and below  i'm using      's glyphicons in a project and want them to become partially transparent on :hover. of course everything works as expected in chrome, ff, safari and even in ie9+.    in ie7 and ie8 however, the opacity makes the icons look horrible. below are the essentials for testing:      !doctype html   html       head           link href="  cdn.com/ - /2.2.2/css/ -combined.min.css" rel="stylesheet"           style              #icon {                 margin: 50px;             }              #icon:hover {                 -ms-filter: "progid:dximagetransform.microsoft.alpha(opacity=70)";                 filter: alpha(opacity=70);                 opacity: 0.7;             }          /style       /head       body           i id="icon" class="icon-search"  /i       /body   /html       any help would be greatly appreciated.
