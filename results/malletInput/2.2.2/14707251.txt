    glyphicons partial opacity in ie8 and below  i'm using      's glyphicons in a project and want them to become partially transparent on :hover. of course everything works as expected in chrome, ff, safari and even in ie9+.    in ie7 and ie8 however, the opacity makes the icons look horrible. below are the essentials for testing:         any help would be greatly appreciated.
