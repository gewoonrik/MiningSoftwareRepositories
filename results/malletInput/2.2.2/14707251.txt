Twitter Bootstrap Glyphicons partial opacity in IE8 and below  I'm using  Twitter Bootstrap 's glyphicons in a project and want them to become partially transparent on :hover. Of course everything works as expected in Chrome, FF, Safari and even in IE9+.    In IE7 and IE8 however, the opacity makes the icons look horrible. Below are the essentials for testing:         Any help would be greatly appreciated.
