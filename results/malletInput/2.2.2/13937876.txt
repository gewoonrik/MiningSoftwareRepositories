  menu customization  I am using Bootstrap 2.2.2 and I was curious if anyone has implemented or has the knowledge on how to customize the mobile navigation? Currently  , when in a mobile or tablet view, displays a button which you can press to drop the menu down vertically.    What I want is to be able to have the menu pull from the right hand side or horizontal. It would be ideal to have a menu that is similar to the Facebook App or Google+ App, where when you hit the menu button the menu slides out from the left hand side pushing all the content of the page to the right.    Can anyone guide me on how to do this with   ? Your help is appreciated!
