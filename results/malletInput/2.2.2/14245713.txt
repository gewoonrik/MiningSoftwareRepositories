Webkit: Twitter Bootstrap modal dialog causes text to disappear  I have a link inside a div that is normally hidden, but appears when hovered over. It triggers a modal dialog when clicked. When the dialog is closed, the link disappears and doesn't reappear when hovered over. This bug only appears on Webkit browsers. I reproduced it on Safari and Chrome, but couldn't get it to show up in Firefox.    HTML:         You can see the bug in action here:        Versions used:      Chrome 23.0.1271.101    Firefox 18.0    Safari 6.0.2    Bootstrap 2.2.2    jQuery 1.8.2
