button classes not added in jquery ui   dialog  i've added ui   theme to my application and most of it seems to work very well, but i can't seem to get my ui dialog buttons to render correctly like the demo.  it seems that jquery ui is not adding the classes to the buttons so that the buttons will be styled.    using chrome developer the buttons should render as:         no classes are being added and i can't find anything that tells me if i need to execute other methods or what the deal is.    thanks.    -v    edit: sorry i forgot to reference the versions i'm using:     : 2.2.2 jquery: 1.8.3 jquery ui: 1.9.2
