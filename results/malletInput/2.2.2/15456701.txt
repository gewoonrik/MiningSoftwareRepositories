How do I determine the height of a div that has yet to be displayed on the page  I am using the tabs feature of the twitter   v2.2.2 API within divs being displayed using twitter modal (again, v2.2.2 of the  ). The problem is, when I do this the modal dialog changes shape and size as the tabs change.    I have been looking at trying to set the size of the div that wraps the tab panes by interrogating those tab panes and setting the outer div to the maximum size and width encountered from the panes. Problem is, whatever I do I always seem to be unable to determine the size of those panes (I assume because they have yet to be displayed?).    My layout (roughly)...          In theory  it should then be as simple as setting the width of the parent div to the width of the widest child and the height of the parent div to the height of the tallest child. I want to measure ClientEditPanel_Tab_Personal, ClientEditPanel_Tab_Profile and ClientEditPanel_Tab_Other and set the maximums on ClientEditPanel_Tabs.    Through debugging, I can confirm that my selector is bringing back the right elements "this" clearly represents my first tab on the first pass through the iterator. Having ascertained that though, whichever property of the div that I interrogate is always null or zero. I have tried the following properties of "this"...      clientHeight    clientWidth    scrollHeight    scrollWidth    innerHeight   innerWidth    outerHeight    outerWidth    style.height    style.pixelHeight   offsetHeight       and probably a few more that I have not listed.    Does anybody have any further ideas that I might achieve what I am looking for. I am sure it can be done as I know that JQuery.dialog can automatically size the dialog to the content (including when combined with JQuery.tabs), but I am too far down the road with the twitter   to change now.    Thanks.
