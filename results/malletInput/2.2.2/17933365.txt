composer does not download twitter/   I have problem with downloading twitter/  package v2.2.2 from packagist by composer.    The error message is after trying to download the package:        [Composer\Downloader\TransportException]  The   "   /zipball/v2.2.2 " file   co  uld not be downloaded (HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found)      It's a little weird because the version really exists. I'm using composer on windows and I have never had such a problem yet.
