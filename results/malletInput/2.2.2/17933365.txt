composer does not download  /   i have problem with downloading  /  package v2.2.2 from packagist by composer.    the error message is after trying to download the package:        [composer\downloader\transportexception]  the   "   / /zipball/v2.2.2 " file   co  uld not be downloaded (http/1.1 404 not found)      it's a little weird because the version really exists. i'm using composer on windows and i have never had such a problem yet.
