getting stack overflow in internet explorer when using class model  in ie, this div tag:         i cannot figure out why.   it works in chrome just fine.   when i remove the class attribute, it works fine in ie also, but i want that functionality.   it seems like ie does not like something in  .   i would prefer not to update the   version right now, but thinking i may have to, to see if it fixes my problem.    using ie 11.0.9600.17239    using   (v2.2.2) and fuelux ui controls and jquery    thoughts on how to fix or troubleshoot this?
