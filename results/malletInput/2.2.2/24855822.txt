Show specific alert, depending on the value of GET in php  Im learning PHP, Html and twitter-  (v2.3.2). I'm trying to display a message depending on the value received by GET.    I have two alerts in different sections of the site and I want depending on the value received by GET display one or the other. not both.    i.e: http:localhost/test.php?load=lannister, should show the message: "A Lannister always pays his debts". however, the url: http:localhost/test.php?load=stark, should show the message: "you know nothing john snow". But I can not figure how to do this, I need a hand, I thought it could be done with an if-else, but I fail to understand how to do it at all. Any ideas?    Heres the code:         I know it's a silly question, but I've been thinking how to do it for hours without any success. Thanks in advance
