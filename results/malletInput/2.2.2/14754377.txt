Bootstrap TypeAhead 2.2.2  I'm using twitter   2.2.2 for my MVC web app. I'm trying to have a auto-complete functionality. TypeAhead seems pretty close to what I want to do but I'm unable to find how to use it for complex object along with Ajax data source. I've seen couple of typeahead forks on github but that don't seem to work with   2.2.2.     I really don't see the use of this control if its not meant to be for complex entities though I'm sure this can't be the case and I've read   2.2.2 does support ajax but I m unable to figure out howto use it. Any guidance in this regard will be much appreciated.
