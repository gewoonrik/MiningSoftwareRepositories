don't set value of   typeahead input on enter  i have a search form using   typeahead to fetch search results.  currently, once the dropdown with search results shows, pressing the enter key sets the value of the field, which in my case redirects the user to the item in the dropdown that had focus.    i'd like this only to happen when someone clicks one of the items in the dropdown.  i'd like pressing the enter key to submit the search form, as normal.    this is   2.2.2, by the way.    here's my code:         $('#productsearch').typeahead({         minlength: 3,         items: 30,         source: function(query, process){            //...fetch some results (code not shown for brevity)         },         matcher: function(item){             return true;         },         highlighter: function(item){             var regex = new regexp('(' + this.query.replace(/ /g, '|') + ')', 'gi');             return item.replace(regex, " strong $1 /strong ");         },         updater: function(item){             if (item){                 window.location.href = '/products/search_redirect/' + map[item].id;             }             return item;         }     });      edit - here's what i tried, to bind to the keydown event and stop   doing its thing:         $('#productsearch').keydown(function(e){         if (e.keycode == 13){             $(this).parents('form').submit();             e.stoppropagation();             return false;         }     });      this didn't work.
