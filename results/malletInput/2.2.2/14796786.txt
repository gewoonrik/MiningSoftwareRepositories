How do I overlap an image in front of twitter  's top navbar?  I want to place a banner image on my Twitter Bootstrap page, with the top of the image overlapping and in front of the top navbar.    My html code is shown below.  It works for small screen widths, but for wider screens, the top of the image appears behind the navbar. I am using Bootstrap v2.2.2.    Any ideas how to make this work for all screen sizes?  Much appreciated!
