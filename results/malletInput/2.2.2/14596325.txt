table body doesn't occupy full table width  i'm using     for a responsive design that contains a table with four columns. i want the table columns to have equal widths, so i have set  td width  to 25%.    i would think that the table rows would inherit their size from the table, and the table cells would then each be one quarter of that. this seems to work when the device width is 768px or greater. when the device width is smaller, the rows are sized based on the text in the largest cell, as opposed to the size of the parent table.    i have included some sample code below, with background coloring on the different elements to highlight the error (made apparent by resizing the window horizontally). the errors are highlighted in yellow (where the underlying table colour is visible).    live example:        i have tested in chrome and safari.      !doctype html   html     head       title table test /title       !--   --       link href="  cdn.com/ - /2.2.2/css/ -combined.min.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen"       script type="text/javascript" src="  cdn.com/ - /2.2.2/js/ .min.js"  /script        meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"        style          td, th { width: 25% !important; }         table { background-color: yellow; }         tr { background-color: gray; }         th { background-color: aqua; }         td:nth-child(1) { background-color: red; }         td:nth-child(2) { background-color: green; }         td:nth-child(3) { background-color: blue; }         td:nth-child(4) { background-color: purple; }      /style     /head     body       div class="container"           h1 hello, world! /h1           div class="row"                      table class="span12"                   thead                       tr                           th a /th                           th b /th                           th c /th                           th d /th                       /tr                   /thead                   tbody                       tr                           td 1 /td                           td 2 /td                           td 3 /td                           td 4 /td                       tr                   /tbody               /table           /div            div class="row"               table class="span12"                   thead                       tr                           th longer table /th                           th headers in /th                           th this /th                           th table /th                       /tr                   /thead                   tbody                       tr                           td 1 /td                           td 2 /td                           td 3 /td                           td 4 /td                       tr                   /tbody               /table           /div       /div     /body   /html
