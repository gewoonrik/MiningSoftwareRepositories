  tooltip causes form elements in grid layout to collapse spacing  i have an issue where the   tooltip causes spacing on my input fields to collapse. the markup is:         i've created a jsfiddle here to show the problem:        note that when an input receives focus, it collapses the whitespace to the right of the control.    i'm just using the example grid form from   2.2.2. the form elements have relative span sizing set and are contained within a div decorated with the controls-row class.    i've tried with the latest version of  -tooltip.js as well but it still shows the same behavior.
