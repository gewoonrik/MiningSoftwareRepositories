create repeatable custom form fields in web2py?  i want to create     compliant form.  according to the  docs for     v2.2.2  (the version included with web2py) the html should look like:         so how can i repeat the above unit of code so i could replace it with something like {{= _field(db.mytable.myfield)}} or some other way to adhere to dry?    what is the web2py way to do this? create a view function? pass a function in the dictionary returned by the controller? create my own html helper? create my own widget? another way?
