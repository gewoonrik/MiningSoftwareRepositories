create repeatable custom form fields in web2py?  i want to create     compliant form.  according to the  docs for     v2.2.2  (the version included with web2py) the html should look like:      form class="form-horizontal"       div class="control-group"           label class="control-label" for="inputemail" email /label           div class="controls"               input type="text" id="inputemail" placeholder="email"           /div       /div  ...      i'm currently using  sqlform  which outputs html that doesn't really fit with this (even using  formstyle='divs' ).  besides i want my html output to be clean without web2py artifacts such as  class="w2p_fl" .  so my thought is to use a custom form.  however in doing this there would be a lot of repeated code.  that is, the following would basically need to be repeated for each field.     {{=form.custom.begin}}  div class="control-group"      {{=label(form.custom.label['myfield'], _class='control-label',         _for='mytable_myfield')}}      div class="controls" {{=form.custom.widget.myfield}} /div   /div  ... {{=form.custom.end}}      so how can i repeat the above unit of code so i could replace it with something like {{= _field(db.mytable.myfield)}} or some other way to adhere to dry?    what is the web2py way to do this? create a view function? pass a function in the dictionary returned by the controller? create my own html helper? create my own widget? another way?
