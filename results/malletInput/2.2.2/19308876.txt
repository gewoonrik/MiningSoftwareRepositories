Create repeatable custom form fields in web2py?  I want to create twitter   compliant form.  According to the  docs for Twitter Bootstrap v2.2.2  (the version included with web2py) the html should look like:         So how can I repeat the above unit of code so I could replace it with something like {{= _field(db.mytable.myfield)}} or some other way to adhere to DRY?    What is the web2py way to do this? Create a view function? Pass a function in the dictionary returned by the controller? Create my own html helper? Create my own widget? Another way?
