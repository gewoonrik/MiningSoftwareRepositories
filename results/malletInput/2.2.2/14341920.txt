Twitter Bootstrap 2.2.2 row horizontal alignments and widths mixed 940px and 960px  I have a very basic layout done with Twitter Bootstrap:         And i have a row horizontal alignment and width problem, picture tells this better:        Red background goes too much to left   No padding to the right      Bootstrap is out-of-box no changes made. Page code:     Twitter   version 2.2.2     Question is:  is this somekind of bug or am i just missing some wrapping html elements or changes to .less variables?
