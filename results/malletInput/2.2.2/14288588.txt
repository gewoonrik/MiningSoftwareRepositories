how to have logo go into / overlay black bar along the top of screen?  i am looking to have a logo extend into a black bar that will run along the entire top of the screen as seen in the example below:      my original thought was that there would be a way to add css to the body to just do a border on the top similar to:         but then i couldn't figure out how to get the logo to go on top of it.    i am using     2.2.2 as a framework in building this. i would prefer to do this mostly in css and not have to use a black image if possible.     thank you all for your time and assistance in this. i greatly appreciate it!
