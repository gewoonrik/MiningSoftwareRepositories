How to have logo go into / overlay black bar along the top of screen?  I am looking to have a logo extend into a black bar that will run along the entire top of the screen as seen in the example below:      My original thought was that there would be a way to add CSS to the body to just do a border on the top similar to:         But then I couldn't figure out how to get the logo to go on top of it.    I am using Twitter Bootstrap 2.2.2 as a framework in building this. I would prefer to do this mostly in CSS and not have to use a black image if possible.     Thank you all for your time and assistance in this. I greatly appreciate it!
