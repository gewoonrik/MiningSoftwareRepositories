multiple spans per row in      i'm working on a project for which i use   2.2.2. due to its nature, it would be most convenient to not close the row every 12 columns, i.e.:         does this method have any drawbacks? so far during testing i haven't found any issues with such layout under chrome, firefox or ie 9. however, if there are any issues that you are aware of, i will appreciate any information (especially if it breaks the layout for any older browsers, although i do not care about ie7 or older).
