Multiple spans per row in Twitter Bootstrap  I'm working on a project for which I use Bootstrap 2.2.2. Due to its nature, it would be most convenient to NOT close the row every 12 columns, i.e.:         Does this method have any drawbacks? So far during testing I haven't found any issues with such layout under Chrome, Firefox or IE 9. However, if there are any issues that you are aware of, I will appreciate any information (especially if it breaks the layout for any older browsers, although I do not care about IE7 or older).
