Display inline errors with simple_form in a Bootstrap Ajax modal  I've found similar StackOverflow questions  here  and  here  but still can't get this to work.    I'm using Rails 3.2.8, SimpleForm 2.0.4, and Twitter Bootstrap 2.1.1 (via the  -sass gem 2.1.1.0).    The user should be able to add a contact from a modal popup window. If there are validation errors, they should appear inline, just as if the user were using a non-modal version of the form (red border around field, error message next to field).    I load the modal like this:      as a JavaScript file, not a JSON variable? Or is there an easier way to handle this altogether?
