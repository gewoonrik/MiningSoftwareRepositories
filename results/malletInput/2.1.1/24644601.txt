angularjs: why can't i select through my autocomplete list from a text box with my arrow keys?  i'm following a code found in angularjs api documentation for "typeahead":    /     i am able to fill the text box with the first choice by pressing enter, but for some reason, i cannot select through any of the items from the autocomplete list with my arrow keys (up and down), but in their example, i could.     what could be the problem here?    ** note, this is an express project, and i'm using the jade engine.    header files     link(rel='stylesheet', href='/css/ .css') script(src='/js/jquery-2.1.1.min.js') script(src='/js/angular.min.js') script(src='/js/ .min.js') script(src='/js/ui- -tpls-0.11.0.min.js') script(src='/js/index.js')      partial code in index.html      div ng-controller="typeaheadctrl" class="col-md-5 ng-scope"       pre class="ng-binding" model {{selected}} /pre       input type="text" ng-model="selected" placeholder="item name" typeahead="item for item in items | filter:$viewvalue | limitto:8" class="form-control"    /div       index.js     var app = angular.module('myapp', ['ui. ']); function typeaheadctrl( $scope, $http ) {     $scope.selected = undefined;     $scope.items = ['chicken', 'corn', 'ice cream', 'cereal']; }           after playing around a bit more, i found that there's another autocomplete from my browser. probably chrome autofill? maybe my up and down is being used for this instead of being used for my web app? if so, how would you disable that via code so i can use it for angular's autocomplete on this page only?
