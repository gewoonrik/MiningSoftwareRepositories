Spring @PathVariable casues JQuery and Boostrap to throw a syntax error  I'm implementing dynamic links in my app.     My security config:         Firebug doesn't show any script when I click on the pinpointed lines. It only says:  No script present on this site     Any other views with static links are properly displayed. But when I used a dynamic link something goes wrong.    Any help appreciated ^^
