jquery utter confusion with codekit  i'm following ray villalobos's advanced web development with   3 on lynda.com and have followed the course to the letter. i've got to combining and minifying javascript files with codekit and its showing me 100's of errors which i have absolutely no clue about.things like this        one of hundreds of errors:      if ( typeof module === "object"    typeof module.exports === "object" ) { 'module' is not defined. â€” column 47        is it perhaps because i've downloaded the 2.1.1 jquery rather than the 2.0.0 version shown on the tutorial? can someone please help - its so frustrating! i mean i could go through and fix most of the "expecting == and got =" sort of stuff but i just have no idea why i'm getting these errors and clearly theres something wrong
