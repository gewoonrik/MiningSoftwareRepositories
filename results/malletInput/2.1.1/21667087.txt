  3 and simple form display issue with form inputs  recent upgrade to   3 on a rails app. simpleform text box and also other form inputs are too large - they are erroneously full-page in length. the app does have responsive design, and the form input boxes do resize.  i'd like to limit the form input size to 50% instead of full page.  i did add this initializer gist     but it did not seem to have an effect.    i am unfamiliar with the  3/simpleform2.1.1 conflicts.     i adjusted the width to 50% in the application.css.scss, but that did not make a clean change
