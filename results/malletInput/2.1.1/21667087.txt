Bootstrap 3 and Simple Form display issue with form inputs  Recent upgrade to Bootstrap 3 on a Rails app. SimpleForm text box and also other form inputs are too large - they are erroneously full-page in length. The app does have responsive design, and the form input boxes do resize.  I'd like to limit the form input size to 50% instead of full page.  I did add this initializer gist     but it did not seem to have an effect.    I am unfamiliar with the Bootstrap3/Simpleform2.1.1 conflicts.     I adjusted the width to 50% in the application.css.scss, but that did not make a clean change
