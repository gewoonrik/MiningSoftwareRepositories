  2 modal breaks on navigation  i'm trying to use a modal from   2.3.2, on a "single page" website running jquery 2.1.1 and angular 1.2.17    when page loads, everything works fine, but navigating seems to break it.    when i click a link loaded as partial by angular and navigate back to page where modal is clicking on "show modal" doesn't do anything anymore.    code:      div       a href="#priceselect" data-toggle="modal" show modal /a   /div   !-- modal --   div id="priceselect" class="modal hide fade" style="height: 90%" tabindex="-1" role="dialog"       div class="modal-header"            button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" ã— /button   [..]      is there any way to trace what really happens?
