Bootstrap 2 modal breaks on navigation  I'm trying to use a modal from   2.3.2, on a "single page" website running jQuery 2.1.1 and Angular 1.2.17    When page loads, everything works fine, but navigating seems to break it.    When I click a link loaded as partial by Angular and navigate back to page where modal is clicking on "show modal" doesn't do anything anymore.    Code:         Is there any way to trace what really happens?
