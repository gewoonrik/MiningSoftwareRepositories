exact same one-line sass code works in one rails project, but not another  first of all this is my first time posting a question on stackoverflow. i'm a big fan. anyway:    i was doing the rails tutorial by michael hartl when, after editing the custom.scss.css file, i suddenly got this error:        sass syntax error        undefined variable: "$gray".     (in /home/shady/workspace/ruby/sample_app/app/assets/stylesheets/custom.css.scss:4)      this isn't a problem with $gray; it is the correct way to spell and capitalize the gray sass variable (i checked, and it works in another rails project). i simplified the custom.scss.css file to pinpoint this error, so all it contains is this:         this was working perfectly fine the last time i edited custom.scss.css, and i haven't done anything substantial since then. i haven't (at least purposefully) edited any file that i think would cause this. i've tried uninstalling and reinstalling  -sass, but it hasn't worked. i believe it's a problem with sass, but as i'm a rails newbie i have no clue on how to fix it. any advice?
