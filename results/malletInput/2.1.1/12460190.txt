Bootstrap NavBar does not show in IE8  My site using   2.1.1 and found a lot of 'problem' when showing in IE8. One of the problem is Navigation Bar, i simplify and replicate "the bug" here:           all .css and .js is by default, the code to display navbar is also taken from   documentation (in order to reduce typo/syntax error)    As you see, the content of menu is not shown in IE8 while it shown in other browser.     Any solution ?
