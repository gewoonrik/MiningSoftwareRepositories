  navbar does not show in ie8  my site using   2.1.1 and found a lot of 'problem' when showing in ie8. one of the problem is navigation bar, i simplify and replicate "the bug" here:           all .css and .js is by default, the code to display navbar is also taken from   documentation (in order to reduce typo/syntax error)    as you see, the content of menu is not shown in ie8 while it shown in other browser.     any solution ?
