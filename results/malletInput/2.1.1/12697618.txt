   : changed navbar collapse threshold, side-effect on drop-downs  i am using      works great, and i see that the navbar now collapses at 779px and expands at 780px.      however, i am seeing a side effect.      when i resize my browser to have a width between 780px and 979px (a range where the navbar is no longer collapsed) and i click on a drop-down, it won't render the drop-down options.  if i resize to 980px or wider, then i see the drop-down options.      i am using firefox firesizer, so i can watch the width.  in fact, if i click on a drop-down and then drag the window size, i can see it draw the drop-down options right at 980px and then they disappear when i go under 979px.      has anyone come across this before?      i suspect there is some other media query for the dropdown-menu (or its related classes) that would need to be changed when changing the navbar collapse threshold.  however, i have not been able to figure out a solution.  i would be very grateful for any help, insight, or recommendations.  thanks!
