Twitter Bootstrap: changed navbar collapse threshold, side-effect on drop-downs  I am using      Works great, and I see that the navbar now collapses at 779px and expands at 780px.      However, I am seeing a side effect.      When I resize my browser to have a width between 780px and 979px (a range where the navbar is no longer collapsed) and I click on a drop-down, it won't render the drop-down options.  If I resize to 980px or wider, then I see the drop-down options.      I am using Firefox Firesizer, so I can watch the width.  In fact, if I click on a drop-down and then drag the window size, I can see it draw the drop-down options right at 980px and then they disappear when I go under 979px.      Has anyone come across this before?      I suspect there is some other Media Query for the dropdown-menu (or its related classes) that would need to be changed when changing the navbar collapse threshold.  However, I have not been able to figure out a solution.  I would be very grateful for any help, insight, or recommendations.  Thanks!
