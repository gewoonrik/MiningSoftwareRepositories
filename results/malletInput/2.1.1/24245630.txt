Twitter Bootstrap 3 Collapsing Rows Doesn't Work Properly  I'm pretty new to programming and stuff, so forgive me if my question is rather stupid or if I am making a really stupid mistake.    I'm trying to make a table that has rows that could expand and collapse on the press of a button, like in Windows Explorer, pressing the "plus" next to the folder will open the files in the directory.    Here's what I wrote:      to the cells as classes doesn't fix it.    Please tell me how to fix it / where I am going wrong.    Thanks, Kartik
