    3 collapsing rows doesn't work properly  i'm pretty new to programming and stuff, so forgive me if my question is rather stupid or if i am making a really stupid mistake.    i'm trying to make a table that has rows that could expand and collapse on the press of a button, like in windows explorer, pressing the "plus" next to the folder will open the files in the directory.    here's what i wrote:      to the cells as classes doesn't fix it.    please tell me how to fix it / where i am going wrong.    thanks, kartik
