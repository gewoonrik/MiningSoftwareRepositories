Polymer/platform.js breaks jQuery on Firefox  I seem to have reached a showstopping bug with Polymer in my current project, and none of the solutions I've found have worked.    Essentially, whenever I load platform.js alongside jQuery, I get the following error every time I click anywhere on the page:      in my code as per the accepted solution, and nothing has changed.    I've already decided to stay the hell away from Polymer for the foreseeable future because of various bugs like this and lack of polish in general, but I can't just drop it now because I'm already using a lot of custom Polymer elements. Can somebody please help me get this resolved?
