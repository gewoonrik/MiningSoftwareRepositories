popovers don't work correctly on table rows using table-striped style  after upgrading to   3 generating a popover on table rows has an unexpected hovering effect on the table row. popovers don't behave correctly on table rows using table-striped style. removal of the table-striped style is one fix but you lose that effect. only tested in chrome. the last working version was 2.1.1.      2.2.2:        is there a way to give the popover a container to stop this effect? or some similar technique?      table class="table table-striped"     thead       tr         th module /th         th controller /th         th action /th         th recorded /th       /tr     /thead     tbody       tr id="popover" data-content="content one" title="system information"         td utilities /td         td transaction /td         td export /td         td 2012-12-26 11:58:10 /td       /tr       tr id="popover" data-content="content two" title="system information"         td utilities /td         td reports /td         td edit /td         td 2012-12-26 12:47:30 /td       /tr       tr id="popover" data-content="content three" title="system information"         td utilities /td         td user /td         td edit /td         td 2012-12-26 12:48:27 /td       /tr     /tbody   /table    // weird table row table-striped hover effect. broken in    // 2.2.2 working in 2.1.1 using selector option has same effect.  $('body').popover({placement:"top",trigger:"hover",selector:'tr[id=popover]'});   table {     margin:50px 5px 0 5px;    }
