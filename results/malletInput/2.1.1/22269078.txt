Popovers don't work correctly on table rows using table-striped style  After upgrading to   3 generating a popover on table rows has an unexpected hovering effect on the table row. Popovers don't behave correctly on table rows using table-striped style. Removal of the table-striped style is one fix but you lose that effect. Only tested in Chrome. The last working version was 2.1.1.    Bootstrap 2.2.2:        Is there a way to give the popover a container to stop this effect? Or some similar technique?
