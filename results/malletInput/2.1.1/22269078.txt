popovers don't work correctly on table rows using table-striped style  after upgrading to   3 generating a popover on table rows has an unexpected hovering effect on the table row. popovers don't behave correctly on table rows using table-striped style. removal of the table-striped style is one fix but you lose that effect. only tested in chrome. the last working version was 2.1.1.      2.2.2:        is there a way to give the popover a container to stop this effect? or some similar technique?
