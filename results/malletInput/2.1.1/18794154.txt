Bootstrap Data Table with Sub Menus  I'm using Bootstrap v2.1.1 I have a datatable that displays 25 rows per page and several pages. In each row I have a dropdown that has a 2nd level submenu as well. When the page initially loads, when I hover over the 1st level menu the 2nd level submenus display as desired. However, if I go to display another page of the datatable, when I hover over the 1st level menu the 2nd level submenu does not display. I inspected the elements and seems like the sub-dropdown and sub-menu classes were only applied on the first page when the page was loaded. When I click to view other pages in the datatable, the classes are not there. Anyone else having this issue? How do I ensure that they are applied on all pages when the page loads?
