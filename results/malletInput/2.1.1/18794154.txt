  data table with sub menus  i'm using   v2.1.1 i have a datatable that displays 25 rows per page and several pages. in each row i have a dropdown that has a 2nd level submenu as well. when the page initially loads, when i hover over the 1st level menu the 2nd level submenus display as desired. however, if i go to display another page of the datatable, when i hover over the 1st level menu the 2nd level submenu does not display. i inspected the elements and seems like the sub-dropdown and sub-menu classes were only applied on the first page when the page was loaded. when i click to view other pages in the datatable, the classes are not there. anyone else having this issue? how do i ensure that they are applied on all pages when the page loads?
