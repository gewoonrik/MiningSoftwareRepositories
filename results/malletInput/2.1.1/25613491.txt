Bootstrap - Footer beng overlapped by main content    Question background:      I'm pretty new to Bootstrap and have been developing a site as of late and have run into an issues with the content of my page 'overlapping' the footer at the bottom when the window is resized to a 'mobile' device resolution.      The issue:      The following picture shows a maximized screen with no overlap.      Re-sized screen, footer overlap:           HTML:      I have a 'master page' which holds the footer, each page implements this.                   Any help resolving this issue would be great. Please note I would also want the 'grey' background div - that holds the 3 images to be responsive.
