    dropdown input field not gaining working with focus() method  i have an issue with gaining focus on my first input field in my login dropdown. i'm using jquery 1.7.2 and   2.1.1 with only the modal and dropdown functions. they both work great, i call dropdowns and modals through data target and not js.    i've been trying for hours and searching for answers everywhere but i can't find a way to get my first input field (#j_username) to gain focus when the dropdown is shown.    the shown event from   does not fire, so i did a jquery on() event which fires fine. my selector works fine, i've tested it in the console with other methods (hide() and show(), and various ways of selecting the same field (either its id #j_username) or ($("#fields input:first").    the event fires correctly but no way to get the input field to gain focus. i've tried html5's autofocus property but it doesn't seem to work either.    any ideas? thanks in advance    the handler is part of function onpageready().
