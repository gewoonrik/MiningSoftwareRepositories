modifying   styles in visual studio 2013 and asp.net mvc5: is this a reasonable approach?  i have a simple asp.net mvc 5 project for which i am using visual studio 2013 on windows 8.    the default appearance of the application is largely determined by  .css. i wanted to modify some styles for example the default font and the background colour of the navbar.     i am new to  . is the following a reasonable approach (i've tried it and it works):      download   source code and install node.js and grunt as described here:         .com/getting-started/        modify values in variables.less as required.     run grunt dist to update the dist directly in       run a command to copy the contents of dist to the appropriate locations in the project source (css to content, .js to scripts, fonts to fonts). however i am omitting the .map files.     i am leaving jquery as-is since the project already has jquery 2.1.1 installed.       this does seem rather a lot of effort just to update a few styles but it is not too bad once set up. however i might be missing a much simpler way and would be interested to know.
