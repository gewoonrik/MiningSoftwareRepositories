Modifying   styles in Visual Studio 2013 and ASP.NET MVC5: is this a reasonable approach?  I have a simple ASP.NET MVC 5 project for which I am using Visual Studio 2013 on Windows 8.    The default appearance of the application is largely determined by  .css. I wanted to modify some styles for example the default font and the background colour of the navbar.     I am new to  . Is the following a reasonable approach (I've tried it and it works):      Download   source code and install Node.js and Grunt as described here:         .com/getting-started/        Modify values in variables.less as required.     Run grunt dist to update the dist directly in       Run a command to copy the contents of dist to the appropriate locations in the project source (css to Content, .js to Scripts, fonts to fonts). However I am omitting the .map files.     I am leaving jquery as-is since the project already has jquery 2.1.1 installed.       This does seem rather a lot of effort just to update a few styles but it is not too bad once set up. However I might be missing a much simpler way and would be interested to know.
