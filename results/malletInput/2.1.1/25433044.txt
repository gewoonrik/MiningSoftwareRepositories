why is my   carousel not moving from the second slide?  i am using   2.1.1 for a site. when adding a slideshow using the   carousel plugin, the slideshow ends after reaching the final slide, instead of looping. this was apparently a bug in   2.x that was resolved in   3.    a full-site upgrade to   3 is not currently feasible, so i updated just the carousel plugin.    however, this has lead to an issue where the first slide transitions to the second, but then the slideshow stops.    this javascript error occurs:    uncaught typeerror: undefined is not a function js_plugins:482 (equivalent 147)    here is the html markup:         thanks for your help.
