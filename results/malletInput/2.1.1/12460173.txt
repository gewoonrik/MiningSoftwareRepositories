Twitter Bootstrap Navigation Bar - Right Alignment Control  I'm using the Twitter Bootstrap (v2.1.1) and trying to customise the position/alignment of the various navigation bar elements.    Here's a jsFiddle showing a simplified version of the navigation bar:           I would like the search input form to appear aligned right but before the last "Dropdown 2". I tried changing:         but that makes the search input form the last navigation bar item, not the 2nd last which is what I'm trying to achieve.    Is this possible to have the search input form 2nd last aligned to the right?    Thanks
