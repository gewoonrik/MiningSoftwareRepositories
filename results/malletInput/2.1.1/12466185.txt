How use Affix component in Twitter Bootstrap 2.1.1  I am trying to use affix component in latest version of twitter   by following  documented steps  and I can't get it work. Here is the example in  JsFiddle     I see two problems      Clicking sidenav links scrolls correctly to appropriate content, but scrolling content doesn't make appropriate sidenav link active   The sidenav is not styled as in    website .      I would appreciate if someone helps to get this working as in twitter   site.
