Twitter Bootstrap Popover hides immediately after show  I am trying to use Bootstrap popovers for error showing. The code works well only after first click on the button. During next clicks popover is showing but disappear immediately.    Added simple helper for popover re-usage:         jQuery used - 2.1.1, Twitter Bootstrap - 3.1.1.    Full sample at  jsfiddle .    Small note: If I call popover destroy and if I do popover re-init on show, all works well. But I think it is not optimal.     Jsfiddle  sample.
