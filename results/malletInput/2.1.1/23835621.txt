Bootstrap modal not behaving as modal  Here's an extremely simple page:         I would expect the dialog to really behave as modal, that is, to disallow tabbing to the first input field while open. Additionally, the input field inside the dialog should be focused on open.    This does not happen. The focus is somewhere else on open (probably the open button), and I can tab across all the controls.
