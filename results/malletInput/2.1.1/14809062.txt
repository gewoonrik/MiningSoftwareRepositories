why does the width of inputs changes?  i'm using   v2.1.1. i'm finding problem with the width of inputs.    this is my simple form:      with  span3  class.    it is very very strange because, if i put span3 in  and  (using the code above) the width is equal.    could someone explain me how can i set equal widths using    span*
