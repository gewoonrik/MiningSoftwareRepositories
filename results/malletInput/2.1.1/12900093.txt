visual glitch using dynamic-data in chosen with   tabs  using   version 2.1.1 using last chosen    i'm experimenting a visual glitch when the chosen is redered inside a tab's content, creating a blank space inside the tab content div and a scroll bar.    jquery code      is called and this is how it looks:         the question is: any ideas how to solve it?
