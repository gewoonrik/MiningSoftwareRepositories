bootswatch theme that looks the same as on the website  i am trying to get the same theme working as here:        however i would like to use the cdn version of  /bootswatch. one is available here:    cdn.com/  they also host the "yeti" theme that i would like to use.    however i am unable to get it working the way i think it should be.    what i have so far:         but i think this css is some kind of internal bootswatch css file that is hosted for the bootswatch.com website itself only and should not be used.    of course i could download the bootswatch.min.css file and load it in the header. however, as it is nowhere stated to do that, i think this is the wrong way? what am i missing?    thanks for any hints!
