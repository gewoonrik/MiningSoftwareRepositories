left arrow key error in  -datetimepicker  I use   -datetimepicker  in my tornado project. I tried the sample in the fold "sample in   v3", and it worked fine. But when I use it in my tornado project, it occured a bug:        click the calendar button       click the left arrow key      click the left arrow key again    I set it to years view when first click the button. And when I click the left arrow, it should change to other years before, but it goes to the mouths view. Then I click the left arrow again, it goes to the days view. It not always performance wrong this way, sometimes it works well. I do not know what is the problem.    My code below:         , the calendar work well. Why is that?
