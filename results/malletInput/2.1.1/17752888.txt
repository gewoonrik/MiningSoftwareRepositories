Bootstrap - Chosen plugin: & in Text changes to    I am using Twitter Bootstrap v2.1.1 with the Chosen plugin that comes with it v0.9.8 and am experiencing a weird issue where if my select contains ampersands like "Tom   Jerry" and I do a search for "m", the text in the Chosen select changes the " " to " " and the "m" in the " " is selected.    Here is a JSFiddle for it:             Even though the Chosen plugin came with Bootstrap, seems like there's some weird conflict. If I remove the  .min.js from the JSFiddle, the " " doesn't get converted and the search works fine. Anyone else experiencing this issue? Does anyone know how to solve it?
