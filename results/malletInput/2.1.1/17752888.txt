  - chosen plugin: & in text changes to    i am using     v2.1.1 with the chosen plugin that comes with it v0.9.8 and am experiencing a weird issue where if my select contains ampersands like "tom   jerry" and i do a search for "m", the text in the chosen select changes the " " to " " and the "m" in the " " is selected.    here is a jsfiddle for it:         $('#chz-select').chosen({search_contains:true});      even though the chosen plugin came with  , seems like there's some weird conflict. if i remove the  .min.js from the jsfiddle, the " " doesn't get converted and the search works fine. anyone else experiencing this issue? does anyone know how to solve it?
