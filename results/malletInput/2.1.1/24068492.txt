  carousel won't work in google chrome  for the past few weeks, i've been using the carousel   plugin without any problems. just recently, it will not work. i've tried it on firefox and it works fine. i saw this  question  and tried everything suggested and it still doesn't work. i've removed all the different scripts and css imports and try to only get the carousel working and it still doesn't work.    here is my carousel code:      file, but chrome sees them (from the resource and elements perspective) as a blank image with 0 width and 0 height (0px x 0px). when i double click on the image in the resources, chrome opens the image in another window and it shows it fine.    this completely baffles me and i have no idea what is going on. i've tried many different things, but nothing seems to work. any suggestions?
