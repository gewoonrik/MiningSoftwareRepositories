asp.net -   drop down navigation working only on root pages  i'm currently developing an internal application using asp.net 4.0 using the yeti   theme.    i'm having an issue with my navbar dropdown navigation. pages that are stored in the root of the website are able to use the drop down features without any issues. the first level drop down is a mouse click, but for the drop down branching off of the admin selection within "interface jobs" appears when the cursor hovers over the selection.    the problem that i'm having is that when i navigate to a page within a drop down, and then try to use the drop down navigation when on that page, the drop downs won't work. i can only navigate to the log viewer page.    does anyone have any ideas as to what the issue might be? thanks in advance for any help!    master page code:
