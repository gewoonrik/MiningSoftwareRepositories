  3 and forced input of simple_forms checkboxes  moving from   v2 to v3, the checkboxes have changed behavior. now simple form v2.1.1 forces the "input checked" into already selected values. if there were selections before, now all boxes are checked instead of holding those values.     looking for a solution to hold the checkbox values instead of having them automatically changed upon edit.    here is edit.html.erb         thank you for your comments in advance.
