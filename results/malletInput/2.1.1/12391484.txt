grails     plugin issue with navbar-fixed-top  i am using  grails 2.1.0  and       plugin 2.1.1   and am encountering an issue with  navbar-fixed-top .    in order to get the navbar fixed to the top of the page to behave correctly during resize, the      docs  states:        add .navbar-fixed-top and remember to account for the hidden area underneath it by adding at least 40px padding to the . be sure to add this after the core   css and before the optional responsive css.      how can i do this when using the grails plugin for    ?      here is what i have tried:     main.gsp       head    ...    r:require modules=" -css"/     style type="text/css"      body {       padding-top: 60px;       padding-bottom: 40px;     }     .sidebar-nav {       padding: 9px 0;     }    /style     r:require modules=" -responsive-css"/     r:layoutresources/   /head       the problem is that grails plugin for     takes the content of   .css  and   -responsive.css  and combines them into the following merged file:  static/bundle-bundle_ _head.css .      thus, i am not able to put the body padding style "after core   css and before responsive css" as per     docs.       here is the view source html that i get from the main.gsp above       style type="text/css"    body {     padding-top: 60px;     padding-bottom: 40px;   }   .sidebar-nav {     padding: 9px 0;   }  /style    link href="/homes/static/bundle-bundle_ _head.css" type="text/css"      rel="stylesheet" media="screen, projection" /       if there is no way to do this, i could always just drop the grails     plugin and manually download     and put it my grails project's  web-app/css ,  web-app/images , and  web-app/js .  however, i would like to be able to use the grails     plugin.     thank you very much in advance, i appreciate it!
