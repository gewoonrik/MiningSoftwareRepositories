    navigation bar - right align dropdown menu  i'm using the     (v2.1.1) with a php site. i'm generating the navigation bar dynamically in a php script as the navigation bar will have different content if the user is logged in or out of the site.     i would like to align the last dropdown menu to the right of the screen but haven't been able to so far. here's a jsfiddle showing a simplified version:           i would like the menu 2 drop down to be right aligned. the code the for last dropdown is the same as for other dropdowns:      li class="dropdown pull-right"   a href="properties.php?type=showall" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" menu 2 b class="caret"  /b  /a   ul class="dropdown-menu"   li  a href="propertiessearch.php" logout /a  /li   /ul   /li                 i've tried chaging it to:      li class="dropdown pull-right"       but that makes no difference. anyone know how to pull the dropdown menu to the right like you can with forms and   p   text?
