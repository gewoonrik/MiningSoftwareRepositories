Bootstrap: fluid table too wide for window  I'm working on a project using twitter  . We have a table that has lots of columns and is gonna be larger than the browser window almost every time.    This is what happens on the right :         The table border stays in the browser window, while the table contents do not. If I scroll, the borders stay where they are, they do not "follow" the browser window.    You can see the problem  on this jsfiddle . It works on safari, not on chrome or firefox.    The layout is like this :         I hope you can help me. If you need more information, just ask, I'd be glad to supply. Thanks a lot for your time.    This is a Rails 3.2 app, using the gem  -sass in version 2.2.1.1 (the problem appears in 2.2.2.0 too). The first three numbers reflect the   version.
