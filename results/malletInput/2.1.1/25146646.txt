Angular.js only loading half the times  I am having an issue with an angular application. I am using bower. When I startup the server, I sometimes get this error:         Uncaught Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module myApp due to:   Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module ui.router due to:   Error: [$injector:nomod] Module 'ui.router' is not available! You either misspelled the modul......2)       Then I sometimes get this error:         Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier angular.js:573        Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'module' of undefined angular-route.js:24        Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL angular-ui-router.js:455        Uncaught ReferenceError: angular is not defined ui- -tpls-0.11.0.js:8        Uncaught ReferenceError: angular is not defined app.js:4        Uncaught ReferenceError: angular is not defined       Sometimes the css doesn't load completely either, but don't get a console error. Other times it works perfectly fine.     Here is my code setup         Not too sure what to do. I thought loading angular then loading the other scripts after a time delay would fix it, but that wouldn't work.
