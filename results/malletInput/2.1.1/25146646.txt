angular.js only loading half the times  i am having an issue with an angular application. i am using bower. when i startup the server, i sometimes get this error:         uncaught error: [$injector:modulerr] failed to instantiate module myapp due to:   error: [$injector:modulerr] failed to instantiate module ui.router due to:   error: [$injector:nomod] module 'ui.router' is not available! you either misspelled the modul......2)       then i sometimes get this error:         uncaught syntaxerror: unexpected identifier angular.js:573        uncaught typeerror: cannot read property 'module' of undefined angular-route.js:24        uncaught syntaxerror: unexpected token illegal angular-ui-router.js:455        uncaught referenceerror: angular is not defined ui- -tpls-0.11.0.js:8        uncaught referenceerror: angular is not defined app.js:4        uncaught referenceerror: angular is not defined       sometimes the css doesn't load completely either, but don't get a console error. other times it works perfectly fine.     here is my code setup         not too sure what to do. i thought loading angular then loading the other scripts after a time delay would fix it, but that wouldn't work.
