How can I add a class attribute to Html.BeginForm() in MVC3/4 preserving the minimal overload  I'm in the process of upgrading my app to Bootstrap 2.1.1 and I need to add a class attribute (class="form-horizontal") to many of the form tags. The problem is, most of the forms use the rather beautiful         But I'd rather not do that. What is the best way to add a class attribute to my form?    I've thought about using a  jQuery  document ready handler to .addClass("form-horizontal") to forms, but am worried that users would see the dreaded 'flash of unstyled content'.    Another approach might be to use a  less -style mix-in, to add the .form-horizontal class to all form style rules but I haven't used less yet, so I'm not sure about this one.    Anyone know the best way to solve this problem?
