how can i add a class attribute to html.beginform() in mvc3/4 preserving the minimal overload  i'm in the process of upgrading my app to   2.1.1 and i need to add a class attribute (class="form-horizontal") to many of the form tags. the problem is, most of the forms use the rather beautiful     @using (html.beginform()) {      format which i'd rather keep. the obvious way to get the class attribute in there is to use the following overload, for example:     @using (html.beginform("register", "account", formmethod.post, new { @class = "form-horizontal" })) {      but i'd rather not do that. what is the best way to add a class attribute to my form?    i've thought about using a  jquery  document ready handler to .addclass("form-horizontal") to forms, but am worried that users would see the dreaded 'flash of unstyled content'.    another approach might be to use a  less -style mix-in, to add the .form-horizontal class to all form style rules but i haven't used less yet, so i'm not sure about this one.    anyone know the best way to solve this problem?
