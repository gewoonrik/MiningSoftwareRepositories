  v2.1.1 modal not getting fit correctly on mobile screen  below is the css part of the code:         it works fine on my desktop, but when i try to shrink the size of the browser, the modal window doesnt seem to introduce scroll bars correctly, and i don't have any option to move vertically or horizontally.
