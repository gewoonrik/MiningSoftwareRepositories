 x popover and close button  i'm developing joomla 2.5 site with template based on     v2.1.1.    i'm also using  x - clickover, a   extension to allow popovers to be opened and closed with clicks on elements instead of hover or focus:    x-clickover .    in popover i'm calling a html file with simple ajax currency converter.    this is html which triggers popover with currency converter:         right now when i click on a link which triggers popover, two popovers appear.    one popover has content from static_converter.html, but it's missing clickover class "popover fade right in". other popover, which is hidden behind first one has correct class "popover clickover fade right in", but it has no content except title which is taken from a.pretvornik.withajaxpower title tag.    so when i click close button in the first popover it actually closes second popover (because it has clickover class). i can't figure out what i'm i doing wrong.    you can see it here:     (click on the "â£ â» â‚¬" in the first semicircle in the top left part of the page).    any help would be appreciated.
