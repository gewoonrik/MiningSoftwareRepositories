wicked_pdf/wkhtmltopdf ignores     css  i am having trouble generating a pdf document in ruby using wicked_pdf/wkhtmltopdf from the following sources:         the generated pdf does ignore  s css completely (meaning the whole layout of the document is scrambled). but it`s completely loaded into the "style" section.    when i try to debug (generate.pdf?debug=1) the output html i do get correct formatting as i wanted it to be (#left is a column on the left of the page, #right is a column on the right).    is wkhtmltopdf capable of rendering     css ?    i`m using latest wicked_pdf gem with wkhtmltopdf 0.11.0 rc1.    thank you for any hint on this !
