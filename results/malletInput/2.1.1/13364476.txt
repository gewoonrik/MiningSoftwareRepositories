wicked_pdf/wkhtmltopdf ignores Twitter Bootstrap css  i am having trouble generating a pdf document in Ruby using wicked_pdf/wkhtmltopdf from the following sources:         The generated PDF does ignore  s css completely (meaning the whole layout of the document is scrambled). But it`s completely loaded into the "style" section.    When I try to debug (generate.pdf?debug=1) the output html I do get correct formatting as i wanted it to be (#left is a column on the left of the page, #right is a column on the right).    Is wkhtmltopdf capable of rendering twitter   css ?    I`m using latest wicked_pdf gem with wkhtmltopdf 0.11.0 rc1.    Thank you for any hint on this !
