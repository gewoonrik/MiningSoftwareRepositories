annoying libv8 error even after successful install  okay. i am trying bootstarp for the first time and i added gems "therubyracer" and "less-rails" to my gemfile along with ' - -rails'. after         bundle install      i get following error.     bundler::gemspecerror: could not read gem at /home/addie/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.1/cache/libv8-3.16.14.3-x86_64-linux.gem. it may be corrupted. an error occurred while installing libv8 (3.16.14.3), and bundler cannot continue. make sure that `gem install libv8 -v '3.16.14.3'` succeeds before bundling.      as it says, i tried:        gem install libv8 -v '3.16.14.3'      and it does succeeds.     building native extensions.  this could take a while... successfully installed libv8-3.16.14.3 parsing documentation for libv8-3.16.14.3 done installing documentation for libv8 after 0 seconds 1 gem installed      but when i try bundle install again, i get the same error as before:      bundler::gemspecerror: could not read gem at /home/addie/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.1/cache/libv8-3.16.14.3-x86_64-linux.gem. it may be corrupted. an error occurred while installing libv8 (3.16.14.3), and bundler cannot continue. make sure that `gem install libv8 -v '3.16.14.3'` succeeds before bundling.      its so annoying! can someone please help me?    edit:    as most of the solution to libv8 questions suggest, i tried         gem install libv8 -v '3.11.8.17' -- --with-system-v8      it succeeds too but makes no difference to bundle install error.
