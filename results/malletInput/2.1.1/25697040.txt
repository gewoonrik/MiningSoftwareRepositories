annoying libv8 error even after successful install  okay. i am trying bootstarp for the first time and i added gems "therubyracer" and "less-rails" to my gemfile along with ' - -rails'. after         bundle install      i get following error.         its so annoying! can someone please help me?    edit:    as most of the solution to libv8 questions suggest, i tried         gem install libv8 -v '3.11.8.17' -- --with-system-v8      it succeeds too but makes no difference to bundle install error.
