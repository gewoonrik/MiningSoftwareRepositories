annoying libv8 error even after successful install  okay. I am trying bootstarp for the first time and I added gems "therubyracer" and "less-rails" to my gemfile along with 'twitter- -rails'. After         bundle install      I get following error.         Its so annoying! Can someone please help me?    EDIT:    As most of the solution to libv8 questions suggest, I tried         gem install libv8 -v '3.11.8.17' -- --with-system-v8      it succeeds too but makes no difference to bundle install error.
