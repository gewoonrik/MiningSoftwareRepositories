photo gallery / grid for     v2.1.1  i'm really liking     so far and am finding it fairly easy to implement. the next step is to implement some-type of photo gallery for some pages and for future blog posts. ideally i would like rows of photos (perhaps 4/row) with nice small borders and pop-up enlarged images either when (a) clicked on or (b) hovered over. i did some research and was unable to find any tutorials or ways how to do this.    many thanks.
