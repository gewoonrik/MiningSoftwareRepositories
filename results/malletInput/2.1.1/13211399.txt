Photo Gallery / Grid for Twitter Bootstrap v2.1.1  I'm really liking Twitter Bootstrap so far and am finding it fairly easy to implement. The next step is to implement some-type of photo gallery for some pages and for future blog posts. Ideally I would like rows of photos (perhaps 4/row) with nice small borders and pop-up enlarged images either when (a) clicked on or (b) hovered over. I did some research and was unable to find any tutorials or ways how to do this.    Many thanks.
