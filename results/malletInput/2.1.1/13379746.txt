how to access   files individually  now that   is running in rails, i want to have full access to all  -files, to exclude (or include) assets as i wish, and additionally add my own assets, variables - which i did (and found easy) before i started to learn rails.    my question: would it be a good practise to copy the whole   folder from  c:\railsinstaller\ruby1.9.3\lib\ruby\gems\1.9.1\gems\ -sass-2.1.1.0\vendor\assets\stylesheets  to my rails application folder e.g.  ..\rails\sample_app\vendor\assets\stylesheets  which is there by default?    thanks!
