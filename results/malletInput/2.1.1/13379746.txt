how to access   files individually  now that   is running in rails, i want to have full access to all  -files, to exclude (or include) assets as i wish, and additionally add my own assets, variables - which i did (and found easy) before i started to learn rails.    my question: would it be a good practise to copy the whole   folder from   which is there by default?    thanks!
