Twitter Bootstrap: How to print Thumbnails as same as screen?  I want to print Twitter Bootstrap Thumbnails as same as screen, but they expand horizontally and background color turns black. I am using Twitter Bootstrap 2.1.1(twitter- -rails 2.1.3) and Chrome on Mac.    My problem is reproduced on this page:       /components.html#thumbnails     Here are screenshots as example.              I would appreciate any help.    UPDATE    Thanks to zeMicro's answer, this problem is fixed. If you are using twitter- -rails, you can remove  .    And you can change the background color by specifying it in your css file.
