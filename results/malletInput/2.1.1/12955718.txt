   : how to print thumbnails as same as screen?  i want to print     thumbnails as same as screen, but they expand horizontally and background color turns black. i am using     2.1.1( - -rails 2.1.3) and chrome on mac.    my problem is reproduced on this page:     http:// .github.com/ /components.html#thumbnails     here are screenshots as example.              i would appreciate any help.    update    thanks to zemicro's answer, this problem is fixed. if you are using  - -rails, you can remove  responsive.css  by editing   _and_overrides.less .    and you can change the background color by specifying it in your css file.
