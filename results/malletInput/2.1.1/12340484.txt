duplicated entries to mysql using jquery ajax and php  i am using jquery (version 1.8.1) with php (version 5.3) to submit a form adding an entry into a mysql database, what is happening is on the first submit everything is fine but for each subsequent submission without a page refresh it adds an additional entry.     in addition i'm also using   (version 2.1.1) and the upload widget from jasny for   (version j1a) in the ui. i have not yet connected the upload widget to the processing or submit as i detected the duplication problem when i was implementing it.     please note that this is a proof of concept system so the code is rough as i'm not going to invest in cleaning it up until the project is confirmed. due to this, you will notice some inline mysql queries, i know that this isn't the best way to do it however it works for the purpose of demonstration and will be cleaned up later. also as a poc system it is on an internal server currently, i can share the code but cannot show an example site at this time unfortunately.     now back to the issue, as an example, the first post for "company 1" has 1 record added for "company 1", the second record for "company 2" adds 2 records for "company 2", the third record for "company 3" adds 3 records for "company 3" and so on. if i reload the form page in any way (refresh or a new request) the problem restarts from the first submission.     i am using jquery
