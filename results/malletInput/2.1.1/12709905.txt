    row nesting  i'm still new with     and the whole grid framework, so please bear with me if this seems like a very noobish question.    but here is what i have so far  in a jsfiddle .     html          what i am trying to achieve is to place 2 small boxes after that last big red box in the white space. i've done some research and i read that it required nesting a row inside a row and then placing a column. but that seemed to apply to a non-fluid application of the spans, i.e fixed widths. i am however measuring those boxes in percentages and am quite unsure as to how to proceed with nesting those rows. any help?
