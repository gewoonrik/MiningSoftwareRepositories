Twitter Bootstrap Row Nesting  I'm still new with Twitter Bootstrap and the whole grid framework, so please bear with me if this seems like a very noobish question.    But here is what I have so far  in a jsFiddle .     HTML          What I am trying to achieve is to place 2 small boxes after that last big red box in the white space. I've done some research and I read that it required nesting a row inside a row and then placing a column. But that seemed to apply to a non-fluid application of the spans, i.e fixed widths. I am however measuring those boxes in percentages and am quite unsure as to how to proceed with nesting those rows. Any help?
