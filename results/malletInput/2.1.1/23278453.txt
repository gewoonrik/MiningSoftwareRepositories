  2 glyphicons not working with rails 4  i have  -sass 2.0 installed, and recently updated from rails 3.2 to rails 4.1. now the glyphicons don't work in production.     for example, no icon shows up for this:      i class="icon-zoom-in"  /i       i tried installing the 'non-stupid-digest-assets' gem and also added the following line to production.rb:     config.assets.precompile += %w( '.woff', '.eot', '.svg', '.ttf' )      but they still don't work. how do i fix it? the  .css file is created from the gem, so i don't want to edit it directly.       update       the issue is that the icons get css for an image that does not exist, such as:     background-image: url(/assets/glyphicons-halflings-d8bbe73c5fea83aefd24440ba9988084.png)      below is part of my gemfile:     source '  '2.1.1'  gem 'rails', '4.1' gem 'bcrypt', '3.1.7'  gem 'faker', '1.0.1'  gem ' -sass', '2.0.0' gem 'will_paginate', '3.0.5' gem ' -will_paginate', '0.0.6'  gem 'font-awesome-sass', '~  4.0.3'   group :assets do       gem 'sass-rails', '~  4.0.3'     gem 'coffee-rails'      gem 'uglifier', '1.2.3'     gem "non-stupid-digest-assets" end  gem 'jquery-rails'
