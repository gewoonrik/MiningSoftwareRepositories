Navbar fixed to top but not full-width  Using the 2.1.1 Twitter Bootstrap, I'm trying to create a navbar that is fixed to the top of the page but which is  not  full width:         then the navbar ends up looking the way I'd like it to - only 940px wide instead of full-width - but then of course it is no longer fixed to the top of the page. How can I keep this navbar fixed to the top of the page without having it become full-width?
