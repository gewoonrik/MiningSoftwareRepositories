navbar fixed to top but not full-width  using the 2.1.1    , i'm trying to create a navbar that is fixed to the top of the page but which is  not  full width:         then the navbar ends up looking the way i'd like it to - only 940px wide instead of full-width - but then of course it is no longer fixed to the top of the page. how can i keep this navbar fixed to the top of the page without having it become full-width?
