  rows and columns not working  no matter what i seem to do the content is never displayed in columns, always just a vertical stack. can you guys double check my code? maybe it's something i'm missing?         also...the   3 files i downloaded from their home page are encrypted? i've been unable to move them, copy them or edit them?     i tried to right-click > properties > advanced > un-check encryption    but it told me i don't have permission? is there a way to fix this?
