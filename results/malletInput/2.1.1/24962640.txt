  rows and columns not working  No matter what I seem to do the content is never displayed in columns, always just a vertical stack. Can you guys double check my code? Maybe it's something I'm missing?         Also...the Bootstrap 3 files I downloaded from their home page are encrypted? I've been unable to move them, copy them or edit them?     I tried to right-click > properties > advanced > un-check encryption    but it told me I don't have permission? Is there a way to fix this?
