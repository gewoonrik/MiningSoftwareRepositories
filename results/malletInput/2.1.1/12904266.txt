Twitter Bootstrap: Hide sub-menus in small screens  If we have submenus then they are visible by default and we have to scroll and scroll. Plz have a look what I want but it is for Bootstrap's previous versions. I am figuring out for 2.1.1 and I believe it should be default feature in Bootstrap (they've changed many things in newer versions)    Plz have a look here:            I am looking for such menu behavior where main menu and sub menus appear only by clicking on relevant sub-menu. I've searched a lot but all of them are for Bootstraps's previous versions.  So anybody with expert advice?
