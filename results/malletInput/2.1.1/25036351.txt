Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function in my jquery script  I got an Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function in my jquery script. My code is given below.              As per the screenshot you can see that there is plus and cross buttons on this page the plus buttons add a new set of textfield and button and the cross remove the textfield beside it. Currently this feature is not working, but if inverse the two jqurey calls in my head it will work but features of  .js will not work.    The plus and cross feature works on jquery.min.js and the  .js works on jquery-2.1.1.js. If I remove jquery.min.js the plus minus feature will not work and if i remove jquery-2.1.1.js the   feature will not work. Please tell me how will I solve this problem so that both of my features will work.
