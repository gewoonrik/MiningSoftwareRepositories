rails application not loading all javascript files production  i am working on a personal website hosted in aws. using ruby 1.9.3 rails 4.1.0beta1. when i run the code locally, it works like a charm. however when i push to aws, its missing either some js files or some css files. i think it is missing js files because if i remove the following from application.js         i can't quite figure out which files are missing. please let me know if you need more information. i have been looking around all over and haven't been able to resolve this issue.    i have tried this:  rails 4: assets not loading in production .
