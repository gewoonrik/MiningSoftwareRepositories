how to make an overlay over a   thumbnail?  i'm using      2.1.1  with a responsive layout and i'd like to float a label in the bottom right hand corner of the image.  one of the problems i'm having is because it's responsive when the thumbnail is wider then the image it floats too far.  the other issue is i can't seem to get it to float to the right.  i should also add that although i want it in the right hand bottom corner i do want it offset by a few pixels to it isn't right on the edge of the image.  also the text might always be photo missing, that is just when a default image is shown.    here is my html so far      li class="span4"     div class="photo-group thumbnail"       a href="/recipes/50500235aa113eb1870001d8" class="photo-wrapper"          img alt="300x200 amp;text=photo" src=" "         span class="label label-inverse photo-label" photo missing /span       /a       div class="caption"         div class="pull-right"          by  a href="/users/50494983aa113ebd5c000001"       hadees          /a         /div         a href="/recipes/50500235aa113eb1870001d8" chocolate crackle cookies /a       /div     /div   /li       and here is my css     .content-header {     padding-bottom: 10px; }  .thumbnail   a   img {     display: block;     margin-left: auto;     margin-right: auto;     max-width: 100%; }  .photo-group .photo-wrapper {   position: relative; }  .photo-group .photo-wrapper .photo-label {   position: absolute;         bottom: 0; }  .photo-group .photo-wrapper .photo-label {   float: right; }â€‹      i've also got a  jsfiddle  for a better example.    maybe the right way to handle this is to just make the photogroup's max width 300 but i think that kind of looks funny on a desktop full screen.
