play framework 2.1.x won't compile     3 less  i am trying to setup a play framework 2.1.1 with     3 using the less files.    i've put the   less files into  app\assets\stylesheets\  .    i've update my project configuration ( build.scala ), in order to compile only the main   .less  file (importing the other files) :      val main = play.project(appname, appversion, appdependencies).settings(     lessentrypoints   = basedirectory(customlessentrypoints),     javascriptentrypoints   = basedirectory(customjavascriptentrypoints) )  def customlessentrypoints(base: file): pathfinder = (     (base / "app" / "assets" / "stylesheets" / " " / " .less") +++     (base / "app" / "assets" / "stylesheets" / "*.less") )  def customjavascriptentrypoints(base: file): pathfinder = (   (base / "app" / "assets" / "javascripts" * "*.js") )      i can't manage to compile  , i get the following :      expected ) in ...\app\assets\stylesheets\ \mixins.less at line 0.      the problem seems to come from the mixin parameters separed by semicolons. when i replace these semicolons by commas it works.    does the play less compiler need commas ? do i need to replace every semicolon by comma or can i configure play less compiler ?    thanks     edit :      there is an official issue here :        it seems that i need to wait for an upgrade of play with a new version of less compiler. i'll be using an external compiler meanwhile.
