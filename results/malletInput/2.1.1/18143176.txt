Play framework 2.1.x won't compile Twitter Bootstrap 3 LESS  I am trying to setup a Play framework 2.1.1 with Twitter Bootstrap 3 using the LESS files.    I've put the   LESS files into      The problem seems to come from the mixin parameters separed by semicolons. When I replace these semicolons by commas it works.    Does the Play LESS compiler need commas ? Do I need to replace every semicolon by comma or can I configure Play LESS compiler ?    Thanks     EDIT :      There is an official issue here :        It seems that i need to wait for an upgrade of Play with a new version of LESS compiler. I'll be using an external compiler meanwhile.
