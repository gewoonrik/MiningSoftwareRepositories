play framework 2.1.x won't compile     3 less  i am trying to setup a play framework 2.1.1 with     3 using the less files.    i've put the   less files into      the problem seems to come from the mixin parameters separed by semicolons. when i replace these semicolons by commas it works.    does the play less compiler need commas ? do i need to replace every semicolon by comma or can i configure play less compiler ?    thanks     edit :      there is an official issue here :        it seems that i need to wait for an upgrade of play with a new version of less compiler. i'll be using an external compiler meanwhile.
