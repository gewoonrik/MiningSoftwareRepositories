Dropdown issues with Twitter Bootstrap when used in Asp.Net MVC3  I was playing with MVC3 Asp.Net and trying to implement the Twitter Bootstrap into the project. I got the basic thing working but not the dropdown. I have the following html code         For some reason the dropdown is not showing up, I have tried couple of things but it's not working. I am not sure if its related to the versions I use. They are    ASP.NET MVC3    jQuery 1.5.1 Bootstrap CSS - v2.1.1 Bootstrap Download JS - v2.1.1    I would appreciate any help on this
