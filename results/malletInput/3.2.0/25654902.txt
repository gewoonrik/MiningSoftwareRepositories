Rails Bootstrap3 form-controls in grid overflow in phone browser  I've taken the example form from the   doc pages and stuck it into my application.html.erb like this:         I add   to the asset pipeline and things look fine in a desktop browser even when I resize the window to phone size but when I connect to my computer on a phone it looks like  this screenshot .    The textfields are too large and overflow the right side of the browser. It looks the same in other browsers. If i add col-xs-10 to the div class the form does fit but I don't think you're supposed to have to do that.    To make it even more infuriating it looks like it's supposed to when I use the phone to look at  this bootply of the form .    Using Rails 4.0.1 but I saw the same effect when I tried 4.1.5.  -sass version is 3.2.0.2. Anyone have any idea about what's going on?
