rails  3 form-controls in grid overflow in phone browser  i've taken the example form from the   doc pages and stuck it into my application.html.erb like this:         i add   to the asset pipeline and things look fine in a desktop browser even when i resize the window to phone size but when i connect to my computer on a phone it looks like  this screenshot .    the textfields are too large and overflow the right side of the browser. it looks the same in other browsers. if i add col-xs-10 to the div class the form does fit but i don't think you're supposed to have to do that.    to make it even more infuriating it looks like it's supposed to when i use the phone to look at  this bootply of the form .    using rails 4.0.1 but i saw the same effect when i tried 4.1.5.  -sass version is 3.2.0.2. anyone have any idea about what's going on?
