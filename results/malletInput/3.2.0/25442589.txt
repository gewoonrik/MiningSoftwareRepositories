  (3.2.0) affix not working  goodmorning,    i tried about 10 tutorials about the affix-plug in in   3.2.0, but it just won't work. it's driving me pretty nuts. my main questions are: * what do i have to put in my css? * do i have to download different filed to my ftp for using affix?    i tried a million times, i'm pretty desperate right now.    this the code i'm using:         please tell me what i do wrong. thanks a lot.
