Bootstrap (3.2.0) Affix not working  Goodmorning,    I tried about 10 tutorials about the affix-plug in in Bootstrap 3.2.0, but it just won't work. It's driving me pretty nuts. My main questions are: * what do I have to put in my CSS? * do I have to download different filed to my FTP for using affix?    I tried a million times, I'm pretty desperate right now.    This the code I'm using:         Please tell me what I do wrong. Thanks a lot.
