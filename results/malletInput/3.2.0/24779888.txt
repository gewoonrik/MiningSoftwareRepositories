compiling less (  v3.2.0)  i have an issue compiling the    v3.2.0  using  lessc v1.7.3     i get an error on file  input-groups.less  on line 43 and on line 48 saying that  ".input-lg is undefined"  and  ".input-sm is undefined"      .input-group-lg   .input-group-btn   .btn {   .input-lg(); //line 43 }  .input-group-sm   .input-group-btn   .btn {   .input-sm(); //line 48 }      i tried to search on all the less files provided but i can't find where this functions are defined.    if i put in my main less file something like      .input-lg { height:45px !important; } .input-sm { height:30px !important; }      i don't get the errors because it's now defined, but if i don't use this i get the errors.    someone knows where the default initialization is? do i need to use another compiler?
