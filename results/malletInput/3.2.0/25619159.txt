 -3.2.0 popover doesn't work  in the bundleconfig.cs, i added  .js and  .css files and in layout page i rendered that files using the below codes :      @styles.render("~/content/css") @scripts.render("~/bundles/jquery")      and than in my index page, i want to use popover tool. my index.cshtml file:      div class="container" style="padding: 100px 50px 10px;"       button type="button" class="btn btn-default" title="popover title"         data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="left"         data-content="some content in popover on left" popover on left      /button   /div    script      $(function () {         $("[data-toggle='popover']").popover();     });  /script       by the way i am using  -3.2.0 so  .js file includes all plugins, doesn't it? i couldn't find where i do a mistake. thanks in advance.    edit-1 :     i've realized something. in my layout page i had been added this line:      script src=" "  /script       but i have already  .js file and when i delete above line, all components doesn't work such as dropdown etc. if i've got  .js file, all components must work, mustn't they?         edit-2 : my bundleconfig class :        bundles.add(new stylebundle("~/content/css").include(             "~/content/ .css"));     bundles.add(new scriptbundle("~/bundles/jquery").include(                     "~/scripts/jquery-{version}.js",                     "~/scripts/ .js"));
