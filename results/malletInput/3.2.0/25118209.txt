Bootstrap modal closes itself when displaying search results  I have a very simple .php search form written and would like to display the results of a search within a Bootstrap v3.2.0 modal.   At this point the search function works fine independently, but when I try putting the same output query inside a modal it opens with all the relevant information inside but closes immediately. Obviously, I want the modal to stay open until closed manually via the user.   I've read that this problem is common to linking to both  .min.js and  .js but that is not the case here. In fact the modal only seems to have this problem when linked from the search form.    html:
