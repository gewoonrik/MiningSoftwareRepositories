Bootstrap-based vertical tab: alignment issues  By using   Twitter Bootstrap     and a very nice   snippet  , I've created a menu-box with multiple choices. For each menu item there is a label and a short description, as shown in figure below:      You could find an example with the code on   JSfiddle  .    Now, I'd like to:       Align menu-item content on middle (regarding the vertical-alignment);     Align the submit button on bottom-right.       Someone can suggest me how to do that?
