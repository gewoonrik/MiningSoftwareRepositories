 -based vertical tab: alignment issues  by using           and a very nice   snippet  , i've created a menu-box with multiple choices. for each menu item there is a label and a short description, as shown in figure below:      you could find an example with the code on   jsfiddle  .    now, i'd like to:       align menu-item content on middle (regarding the vertical-alignment);     align the submit button on bottom-right.       someone can suggest me how to do that?
