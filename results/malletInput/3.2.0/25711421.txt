changing h1 color of   jumbotron  pretty new to   and just started to play around with it. but there's one thing (that should be extremely obvious) that i can't get to work. and thats changing the color of the h1 tags in the jumbotron.    html code:      !doctype html   html   head       title hello www /title       link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css"        !-- latest compiled and minified css --       link rel="stylesheet" href="  cdn.com/ /3.2.0/css/ .min.css"    /head    body       div class="jumbotron"           h1 progression of connected computing /h1           p learn more about the internet /p       /div   /body   /html       main.css code:     .jumbotron h1{     color: #fff; }  .jumbotron p{     color: #fff; }      the problem is, the p tags are correctly changed and turn white, but for some reason the h1 tags don't? probably something silly i'm doing but i can't seem to figure out what it is. thanks!
