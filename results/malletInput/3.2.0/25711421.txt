Changing h1 color of Bootstrap Jumbotron  pretty new to Bootstrap and just started to play around with it. But there's one thing (that should be extremely obvious) that I can't get to work. And thats changing the color of the h1 tags in the jumbotron.    HTML Code:         The problem is, the p tags are correctly changed and turn white, but for some reason the h1 tags don't? Probably something silly I'm doing but I can't seem to figure out what it is. Thanks!
