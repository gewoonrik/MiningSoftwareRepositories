changing h1 color of   jumbotron  pretty new to   and just started to play around with it. but there's one thing (that should be extremely obvious) that i can't get to work. and thats changing the color of the h1 tags in the jumbotron.    html code:         the problem is, the p tags are correctly changed and turn white, but for some reason the h1 tags don't? probably something silly i'm doing but i can't seem to figure out what it is. thanks!
