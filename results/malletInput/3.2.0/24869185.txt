responsive webdesign with  : equal height boxes for 3-column and 2-column grid layout  i am using   3.2.0 and i have a grid design with 6 boxes.    the first three boxes have more content than the last three ones.    for large screens sizes i have a 3-column layout, for medium screens sizes 2-column and small one 1-column. the 1-column layout is not the problem, because all boxes will be positioned vertically.    for the 3-column layout the boxes 1, 2 and 3 should be positioned in one row with equal heights. the same for boxes 4, 5 and 6: in one row below the first row and with equal heights.    for the 2-colums layout the boxes 1 and 2 should be in one, boxes 3 and 4,5 should be in one row and box 6 in the last row on the left hand side.    you can see this what i wanted to have in this picture:      i made a fiddle so you can see what i did:        here is the code snippet:      div class="container-fluid"       div class="row-fluid"           div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4"               div class="bs-grid-big"                  box 1              /div           /div           div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4"               div class="bs-grid-big"                  box 2              /div           /div           div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4"               div class="bs-grid-big"                  box 3              /div           /div       /div        div class="row-fluid"           div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4"               div class="bs-grid-small"                  box 4              /div           /div           div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4"               div class="bs-grid-small"                  box 5              /div           /div           div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4"               div class="bs-grid-small"                  box 6              /div           /div       /div   /div       is there an easy way to do this with  ? i think the 2-column layout will be hard to get box 4 and 5 to an equal height with box 3.
