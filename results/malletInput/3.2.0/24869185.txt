Responsive Webdesign with Bootstrap: Equal height boxes for 3-column and 2-column grid layout  I am using Bootstrap 3.2.0 and I have a grid design with 6 boxes.    The first three boxes have more content than the last three ones.    For large screens sizes I have a 3-column layout, for medium screens sizes 2-column and small one 1-column. The 1-column layout is not the problem, because all boxes will be positioned vertically.    For the 3-column layout the boxes 1, 2 and 3 should be positioned in one row with equal heights. The same for boxes 4, 5 and 6: in one row below the first row and with equal heights.    For the 2-colums layout the boxes 1 and 2 should be in one, boxes 3 and 4,5 should be in one row and box 6 in the last row on the left hand side.    You can see this what I wanted to have in this picture:      I made a fiddle so you can see what I did:        Here is the code snippet:         Is there an easy way to do this with Bootstrap? I think the 2-column layout will be hard to get box 4 and 5 to an equal height with box 3.
