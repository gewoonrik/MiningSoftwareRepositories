Equal heights of boxes in one row with columns which have more than one box  I am using Bootstrap 3.2.0 and the library jQuery-match-height ( GitHub web page ) because I need to have equal height columns.    I created a simple example of my problem with  this fiddle .         I have 1-, 2- or 3-column layout based on the width of the webbrowser window. 1- and 3- column layout works really fine, but not the 2-column layout.    I also created a picture of what I wanted to have:         You see three bigger boxes (1, 2 and 3) and three smaller ones (4, 5 and 6) all with dynamic content and font sizes.    The problem is the second row. I want to make boxes 4 and 5 (with margin) as high as box 3 if box 3 is higher than both together. If boxes 4 and 5 are together higher (with margin) than box 3 it should be stretched in height so they are horizontally aligned as shown in my image.    How can I do this?
