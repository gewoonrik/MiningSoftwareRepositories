equal heights of boxes in one row with columns which have more than one box  i am using   3.2.0 and the library jquery-match-height ( github web page ) because i need to have equal height columns.    i created a simple example of my problem with  this fiddle .     $(function() {     $('.bs-grid-big').matchheight();     $('.bs-grid-small').matchheight(); });      i have 1-, 2- or 3-column layout based on the width of the webbrowser window. 1- and 3- column layout works really fine, but not the 2-column layout.    i also created a picture of what i wanted to have:         you see three bigger boxes (1, 2 and 3) and three smaller ones (4, 5 and 6) all with dynamic content and font sizes.    the problem is the second row. i want to make boxes 4 and 5 (with margin) as high as box 3 if box 3 is higher than both together. if boxes 4 and 5 are together higher (with margin) than box 3 it should be stretched in height so they are horizontally aligned as shown in my image.    how can i do this?
