how should i handle "no-gap" and not "extra-width" in     grid  first of all take a look to this picture:         i'm trying to build this using     (3.2.0) but doesn't know how to. so after read tb docs and google some resources i came with this possible solutions:      not use  row  and  cols-x  class from tb which may cause issues later for responsiveness and so on   use them and overwrite the behavior by removing any  padding  or  margin  causing the gap between the two  div       in this case which one should i use? what yours use on this cases?    as second question and related to the same:      how do yours calculate the right  cols-x  to apply in order to get as close as image width is? any formula? right now i'm doing using firebug and applying cols on the fly but this is insane, any advice?
