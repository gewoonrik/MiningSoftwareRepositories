How should I handle "no-gap" and not "extra-width" in Twitter Bootstrap grid  First of all take a look to this picture:         I'm trying to build this using Twitter Bootstrap (3.2.0) but doesn't know how to. So after read TB docs and Google some resources I came with this possible solutions:      Not use   to apply in order to get as close as image width is? Any formula? Right now I'm doing using Firebug and applying cols on the fly but this is insane, any advice?
