Multiple carousel-indicators for Bootstrap Carousel  I am trying to make two carousel-indicators with Bootstrap 3.2 which has proven difficult with my relatively beginner JavaScript skills. I've tried adding in two carousel-indicators list items, but it only effects on set of indicators. How can I have two carousel-indicators for one carousel? Thanks!    JavaScript from Bootstrap.
