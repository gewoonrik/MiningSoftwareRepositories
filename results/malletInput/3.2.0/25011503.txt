How to create navbar/ tabs with squares that touch each other  I want to create horizontal navigation tabs/ navbar. I want it to be something like the picture, with squares for each tab. The squares touch each other.  Something similar to the stackoverflow tabs above: Questions/ Tags / Users etc but without spaces between tabs. The black square in the picture is a tab that is selected. I attach code where I tried Tabs and navbar, and a combination of them and didn't get it. What is the way to do it in Bootstrap?
