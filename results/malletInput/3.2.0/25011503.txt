how to create navbar/ tabs with squares that touch each other  i want to create horizontal navigation tabs/ navbar. i want it to be something like the picture, with squares for each tab. the squares touch each other.  something similar to the stackoverflow tabs above: questions/ tags / users etc but without spaces between tabs. the black square in the picture is a tab that is selected. i attach code where i tried tabs and navbar, and a combination of them and didn't get it. what is the way to do it in  ?     link to plunker :
