add/remove classes using media queries   my general question is how can one conditionally add or remove classes or ids to a particular class using css media queries alone? in the sample code below, for example, how could i add "class_b" to all of the div's with "class_a" when  @media all and (max-width: 1000px) and (min-width: 700px) ?        div class="class_a"  div          my specific case: i'm using     v3.2.0.  i have a header with a series of buttons in it like so:      button class="btn navbar-btn" fooa /button   button class="btn navbar-btn" foob /button   button class="btn navbar-btn" fooc /button        when the screen jumps from medium (md) to small(sm), i would like to add the class "btn-sm" to all of those elements. how can i do that most efficiently/elegantly?  (i would prefer not to use js or add any additional libraries if that's possible)    i realize i could add an arbitrary class to all those buttons like "btn-sm-duplicate" and only define it when the browser reaches a certain specification like the code below. however, it seems ugly to create a duplicate class when it's really not nec... can you suggest something?     @media all and (max-width: 1000px) and (min-width: 700px) {        btn-sm-duplicate{  ::copy/paste all the attributes of btn-sm from  ::         } }
