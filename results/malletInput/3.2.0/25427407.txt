  3 .container-fluid with grid adding unwanted padding  i'd like my content to be fluid, but when using  .container-fluid  with  's grid, i'm still seeing padding.  how can i get rid of the padding?    i see that i don't get the padding with .row, but i want to add columns, and as soon as i do, the padding is back :o.    i want to be able to use the columns at full width.    an example:      div class="container-fluid"       div class="row"         div class="col-sm-6"       p use this document as a way to quickly start any new project. br  all you get is this text and a mostly barebones html document. /p     /div      div class="col-sm-6"       p use this document as a way to quickly start any new project. br  all you get is this text and a mostly barebones html document. /p     /div    /div       solution i've got:    override  .css, linke 1427   1428 (v3.2.0)      padding-right: 15px;   padding-left: 15px;    to    padding-right: 0px;   padding-left: 0px;
