  example not rendering gray box. everything else fine?  i used 'view source page' and took all the html from the this example on the   website:    .com/examples/carousel/     it runs smoothly on my localhost using django except for one small thing. that gray box within the sliding carousel doesn't appear? oddly, if i put all the html into jsfiddle it's also missing.     i've included the css and works perfectly for everything else on the page:      link rel="icon" href="../../favicon.ico"   link href="carousel.css" rel="stylesheet"   link href="../../dist/css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet"   link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn. cdn.com/ /3.2.0/css/ -theme.min.css"       so my django page looks exactly like this:        funkylaundry has identified that some of the css isn't loading for some reason. he found this warnings/errors using a debugging tool called firebug:     failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (not found)       to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (not found)   .min.css failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (not found)   to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (not found)   to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (not found)   .min.js failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (not found)       i'm not sure what to do because i'm new   and i usually just use a simple external css file. should i be seeing new css files in my assets folder on django too? becuase i don't. i'd love to get the gray box to appear, but i'm stumped.
