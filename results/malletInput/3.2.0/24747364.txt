Bootstrap Example Not Rendering Gray Box. Everything Else Fine?  I used 'view source page' and took all the html from the this example on the   website:    .com/examples/carousel/     It runs smoothly on my localhost using Django except for one small thing. That Gray Box within the sliding carousel doesn't appear? Oddly, if I put all the html into JSfiddle it's also missing.     I've included the CSS and works perfectly for everything else on the page:         I'm not sure what to do because I'm new   and I usually just use a simple external css file. Should i be seeing new css files in my assets folder on django too? Becuase I don't. I'd love to get the gray box to appear, but I'm stumped.
