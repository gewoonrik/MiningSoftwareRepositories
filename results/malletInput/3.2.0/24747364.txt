  example not rendering gray box. everything else fine?  i used 'view source page' and took all the html from the this example on the   website:    .com/examples/carousel/     it runs smoothly on my localhost using django except for one small thing. that gray box within the sliding carousel doesn't appear? oddly, if i put all the html into jsfiddle it's also missing.     i've included the css and works perfectly for everything else on the page:         i'm not sure what to do because i'm new   and i usually just use a simple external css file. should i be seeing new css files in my assets folder on django too? becuase i don't. i'd love to get the gray box to appear, but i'm stumped.
