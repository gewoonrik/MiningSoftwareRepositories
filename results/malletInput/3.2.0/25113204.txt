Why Does Making my div into a circle affect   columns?  I am working on a website and I am trying to make use of the grid/column system provided in  . What I want to do is have a picture on the left side with the text beside it to the right. This is the html that I have written so far:         My problem is that the first div is not taking up 4 columns as I expect it too which is causing it these elements to be uncentered. I think the problem occurring because I specified the width and height for the circle and that is overwriting something in col-xs-4. Is that the case? If so, how would I go about centering these elements? If not then, Why is the circle not taking up 4 columns worth of space?    EDIT: I am using   3.2.0. I have tested on safari and chrome and I do not have any custom rules for col-xs-4.
