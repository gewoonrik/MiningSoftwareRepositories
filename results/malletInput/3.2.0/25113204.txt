why does making my div into a circle affect   columns?  i am working on a website and i am trying to make use of the grid/column system provided in  . what i want to do is have a picture on the left side with the text beside it to the right. this is the html that i have written so far:         my problem is that the first div is not taking up 4 columns as i expect it too which is causing it these elements to be uncentered. i think the problem occurring because i specified the width and height for the circle and that is overwriting something in col-xs-4. is that the case? if so, how would i go about centering these elements? if not then, why is the circle not taking up 4 columns worth of space?    edit: i am using   3.2.0. i have tested on safari and chrome and i do not have any custom rules for col-xs-4.
