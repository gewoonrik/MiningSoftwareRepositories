why does making my div into a circle affect   columns?  i am working on a website and i am trying to make use of the grid/column system provided in  . what i want to do is have a picture on the left side with the text beside it to the right. this is the html that i have written so far:      div class="container"       div class="row"           div class="col-xs-4 circle-pic"               !-- circle --           /div           div class="col-xs-8"              words and stuff go here          /div       /div   /div       and this is the css that i've written so far:     .circle-pic {     height: 150px;     width: 150px;     border-radius: 100%;     border: 2px solid black; }      my problem is that the first div is not taking up 4 columns as i expect it too which is causing it these elements to be uncentered. i think the problem occurring because i specified the width and height for the circle and that is overwriting something in col-xs-4. is that the case? if so, how would i go about centering these elements? if not then, why is the circle not taking up 4 columns worth of space?    edit: i am using   3.2.0. i have tested on safari and chrome and i do not have any custom rules for col-xs-4.
