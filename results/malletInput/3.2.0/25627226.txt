CSS borders behaving sporadicly in a listing  I'm having a weird issue that I'm seeing across my web app. I have multiple instances of lists that have borders and I'm noticing when the list items change (and sometimes when they are first shown) there are extra borders show inside the element.

I'm using Bootstrap 3.2.0.    Here are some examples, I created this error by manually changing the height of the image inside the list item:
