Bootstrap ScrollSpy Nav Issue on iPad (Landscape Mode)  I'm having problem with a   menu and his scroll spy method. I've uploaded an example here:           with inside links in red to highlight the problem    If you see on your desktop browser everything is ok. Now, see it on you safari mobile browser with at least 768px or more resolution.    If you jump (with a click) from a section to another one (eg. from home to link2) and then you scroll up, the link2 section remain red. If you scroll up or down without clicking on a section, scroll spy functions without problems!    Can you help me please?    HTML:
