jw player vtt thumbnails background messed up by   3  i'm using jw player on a   styled site, with tooltip thumnails using a .vtt file. all works well except the jw player displays a grey background rounded rectangle behind the thumbnails.   styles make the gray background behind the thumbnails too narrow, so that the thumbnail stick over the background on the right side. i believe it may have to do with the fact that   3 applies "box-style: border-box" with the universal selector *. if i change the box-sizing to content-box instead of what   does (see comments in code below), it fixes the thumbnails background--but of course it messes up the rest of the site. maybe there is a way to target just the player but i can't figure it out. any help appreciated.
