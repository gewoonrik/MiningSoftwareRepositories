JW Player VTT thumbnails background messed up by Bootstrap 3  I'm using JW Player on a Bootstrap styled site, with tooltip thumnails using a .vtt file. All works well except the JW Player displays a grey background rounded rectangle behind the thumbnails. Bootstrap styles make the gray background behind the thumbnails too narrow, so that the thumbnail stick over the background on the right side. I believe it may have to do with the fact that Bootstrap 3 applies "box-style: border-box" with the universal selector *. If I change the box-sizing to content-box instead of what Bootstrap does (see comments in code below), it fixes the thumbnails background--but of course it messes up the rest of the site. Maybe there is a way to target just the player but I can't figure it out. Any help appreciated.
