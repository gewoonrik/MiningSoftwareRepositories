jw player vtt thumbnails background messed up by   3  i'm using jw player on a   styled site, with tooltip thumnails using a .vtt file. all works well except the jw player displays a grey background rounded rectangle behind the thumbnails.   styles make the gray background behind the thumbnails too narrow, so that the thumbnail stick over the background on the right side. i believe it may have to do with the fact that   3 applies "box-style: border-box" with the universal selector *. if i change the box-sizing to content-box instead of what   does (see comments in code below), it fixes the thumbnails background--but of course it messes up the rest of the site. maybe there is a way to target just the player but i can't figure it out. any help appreciated.      !-- here is the basic hosted   code --   link rel="stylesheet" href="  cdn.com/ /3.2.0/css/ .min.css"   link rel="stylesheet" href="  cdn.com/ /3.2.0/css/ -theme.min.css"   script src="  cdn.com/ /3.2.0/js/ .min.js"  /script    !--  note if you uncomment this box-sizing immediately below, the problem goes away....       .... but it messes up all of the other   styles in the application --   !--  style  * {   -webkit-box-sizing: content-box-box;   -moz-box-sizing: content-box;   box-sizing: content-box; }  /style  --    script src=" "  /script    div id="container"  nbsp; /div   script type="text/javascript"  jwplayer("container").setup({     height: 540,     width: 1280,     file: '     image: '     tracks: [{       file: '       kind: 'thumbnails'     }] });  /script
