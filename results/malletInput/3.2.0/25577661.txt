angularjs error: font from origin '  .com' has been blocked from loading by cross-origin resource sharing policy  i'm working on an angularjs web app and i'm almost done with my ui but i'm getting this error that says,     "font from origin '   .com ' has been blocked from loading by cross-origin resource sharing policy: no 'access-control-allow-origin' header is present on the requested resource. origin 'localhost' is therefore not allowed access."    i've compared my code to my other working code and i can't seem to find the problem. i've also searched around to see if anyone's having the same problem but everyone else is having jquery or some type of json problem. this is a   error which is really confusing me because i can't find exactly where in my code is giving me this error. any ideas? thanks    edit:    here's a snippet of my dependencies:          meta charset="utf-8"   meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"   meta http-equiv="cache-control" content="no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, pre-check=0, post-check=0, max-age=0" /   meta http-equiv="pragma" content="no-cache" /   meta http-equiv="expires" content="0" /   script src=" "  /script   script src=" "  /script   script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular-ui- /0.10.0/ui- -tpls.min.js"  /script   !-- script src="  cdn.com/ /3.2.0/js/ .min.js"  /script --   script src="//angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/release/angular-ui-router.js"  /script   script src="user.js"  /script   !-- link href="  cdn.com/ /3.2.0/css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" --   link rel="stylesheet" href="  cdn.com/ /3.2.0/css/ .min.css"   link rel = "stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/ .css"   link rel = "stylesheet" type="text/css" href="client_ui.css"
