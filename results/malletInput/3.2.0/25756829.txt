using    's theme.less with wro4j-maven-plugin  for some reason, i can't get  theme.less  (from   3.2.0) to build/compile with wro4j. i get a number of errors in the maven plugin output, such as:     [info] processing group:  -theme.css 2487 error less4jprocessor      - failed to compile less resource: ro.isdc.wro.model.resource.resource@53bb87b9[css, -theme,true]. 2487 error less4jprocessor      - 2069:13 no viable alternative at input ' ' in ruleset (which started at 2068:1). 2487 error less4jprocessor      - 2069:25 mismatched input '@start-color' expecting '~' escaped value '' in selectors (which started at 2069:3). 2487 error less4jprocessor      - 2069:25 no viable alternative at input '@start-color' in ruleset (which started at 2069:3). 2487 error less4jprocessor      - 2069:46 no viable alternative at input '@progress-bg' in selectors (which started at 2069:37).      the line numbers are useless due to the css imports, but they look to correspond to some of the references in the  theme.less  file.    wro.properties     preprocessors=cssimport,semicolonappender    postprocessors=less4j,cssminjawr      wro.xml      groups xmlns=" "       !-- this file configures the web resource optimizer for java (wro4j). this          tool minifies js, compiles less css, etc. see            and   - -project          for details. --       group name=" "           css / -3.2.0/less/ .less /css           js / -3.2.0/js/*.js /js       /group       group name=" -theme"           css / -3.2.0/less/theme.less /css       /group   /groups       pom.xml      plugin       !-- run the web resource optimizer for java (wro4j) as part of the build.          this tool minifies js, compiles less css, etc. see            and   - -project          for details. --       groupid ro.isdc.wro4j /groupid       artifactid wro4j-maven-plugin /artifactid       version 1.7.6 /version       configuration           wromanagerfactory ro.isdc.wro.maven.plugin.manager.factory.configurablewromanagerfactory /wromanagerfactory           !--  targetgroups   /targetgroups  --           !-- search for resources in both the source and output trees, to ensure              that generated resources are also found. --           contextfolder ${basedir}/src/main/webapp/,${project.build.directory} /contextfolder           destinationfolder ${project.build.outputdirectory}/${project.build.finalname} /destinationfolder           cssdestinationfolder ${project.build.directory}/${project.build.finalname}/web-inf/resources/css /cssdestinationfolder           jsdestinationfolder ${project.build.directory}/${project.build.finalname}/web-inf/resources/js /jsdestinationfolder       /configuration       executions           execution               phase compile /phase               goals                   goal run /goal               /goals           /execution       /executions   /plugin       i'm afraid that i'm rather out of ideas here. the normal   .less  builds just fine-- it's only the theme that seem to not.
