how is this   scss file finding the imports?  i'm integrating   into my django project, and i've roughly followed the instructions  here  to get the sass version working.    i'm trying to understand what's going on though, and one thing confuses me. this is what my directory structure looks like:     myapp     ...     sass          ped             _ _variables.scss              _compiled.scss     static          -sass-3.2.0             (all the stuff downloaded from  's website)         css              ped                  _compiled.css     config.rb      my  _compiled.scss file is just:     @import " -compass"; @import " -variables"; @import " ";      and in the test template, i'm doing      link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'css/ ped/ _compiled.css' %}" /       but in  _compiled.scss,  .scss and _ -compass.scss are actually in the  -sass-3.2.0 folder. in config.rb, i have this line:     sass_dir = "sass"      i'm confused as to how the  _compiled.scss file can find the second and third files and compile everything correctly.     also, am i supposed to keep the  -sass-3.2.0 folder in static/ ?
