Upgrade  -sass from 2 to 3  I've got an existing ruby on rails web application running rails 4 with  -sass 2.3.2.1. It works great and everything looks fine. I have a variables.css.scss file to define many of the styles to go with it.    I'm attempting to upgrade  -sass to 3.2.0.0. I can get everything working, but obviously the variables are all named differently now ($baseFontFamily became $font-family-base). The conversions often aren't straightforward.    What I'm hoping to get from you guys is some script, plugin, or other method that will convert my variables.css.scss file to match the new bootstap. Does such a thing exist? If not, I will be spending days just trying to get everything to look right again.    Thanks!     EDIT     I'm in the midst of trying the manual conversion. I have the site running. Unfortunately, it's even more difficult to convert than I had thought. Some variables have changed unit types (px to non-px). Is there a more automated way to do this?
