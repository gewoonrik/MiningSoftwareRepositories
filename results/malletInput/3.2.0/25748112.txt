load local   css and js if load fail from remote  I'm trying to load local css   js file when remote file is not available. (wifi dis-connected) The major problem is "I don't know how to let css load proper". As I know jquery should put on bottom of body to reduce page load time. In browser's address line, I input localhost:8000//example.html (use a static web page web browser).     Demo Code
