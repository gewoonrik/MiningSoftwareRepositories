load local   css and js if load fail from remote  i'm trying to load local css   js file when remote file is not available. (wifi dis-connected) the major problem is "i don't know how to let css load proper". as i know jquery should put on bottom of body to reduce page load time. in browser's address line, i input localhost:8000//example.html (use a static web page web browser).     demo code
