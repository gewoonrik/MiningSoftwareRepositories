jquery     still have error  so i am doing a tutorial right now trying to clear up this error "uncaught error:  's javascript requires jquery ".  i've been able to use   but it always says this even if i change to the highest jquery version. is it cause it's not local and i'm using a cdn perhaps? i just would like the error gone.
