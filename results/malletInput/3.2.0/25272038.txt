Navbar does not appear when the file is saved in a nested folder  Bootstrap: my navbar code does not appear when a copy of the same file is saved in a different folder, even though the code is exactly the same Bootstrap: I have tried looking for an answer to this question on the net but I cannot find the answer.    Here is my code that works.  It is located in file:///C:/Users/Spiridon/Desktop/ -3.2.0-dist/index-1.html.         Navbar does not appear when I run a copy of the same file from another folder. Same code, but from this folder: file:///C:/Users/Spiridon/Desktop/ -3.2.0-dist/index/index-1.html
