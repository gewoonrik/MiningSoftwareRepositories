Bootstrap NavBar stopped working       I recently started using   and it was going well. I was learning alot and i started using the navbar they have. I used it and it was going well i even made a quick phone case website everything was going well. Until i checked on my file and saw that my website had changed. I dont understand it was fine a day ago and i didnt touch anything.  What website looks like now
