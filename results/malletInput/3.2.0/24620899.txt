How to make a caret in a link change color when the LINK is hovered over?  In my HTML, I created a link on my navbar that when hovered over, causes a [dropdown] menu to drop:         And this^^ deals with white being the color the non-active links become when hovered over - therefore they remain white. (And this applies to the "Dropdown" link also.)    What I was originally thinking was to define "Dropdown" by #link for example and then treat it separately from the other links and create some nested structure in which the .caret code would be put, but I have no idea how to pull that off - I failed miserably.    Anyway, if any of you guys could help, I'd be eternally grateful !!! Let me know if there's some other code you need to better understand what I'm going for, or already have.    I'm using Bootstrap 3.2.0 btw.
