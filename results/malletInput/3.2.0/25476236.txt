typeahead.js remote beforesend post not working  i'm working with typeahead.js 0.10.3,   3.2.0 and jquery 1.10.2 for ui in an mvc application. i had the typeahead working with   2.3 typeahead. apparently the standard help on the typeahead.js is not good enough on how use remote option for the data. after spending sometime looking at the similar issues i'm still not able to make it work.     here is my code below, on keyup it is generating the ajax call but still sending a get request instead of post. my controller method expects a parameter in post request.         fiddler:    request:    "get "'/home/acclookup http/1.1'" host: localhost connection: keep-alive accept: application/json, text/javascript,  / ; q=0.01 x-requested-with: xmlhttprequest user-agent: mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 6.1; wow64) applewebkit/537.36 (khtml, like gecko) chrome/36.0.1985.143 safari/537.36    accept-encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch accept-language: en-us,en;q=0.8"    response:    [httpexception]: a public action method &#39;acclookup&#39; was not found on controller &#39;testproject.controllers.homecontroller&#39;.    at system.web.mvc.controller.handleunknownaction(string actionname)    at system.web.mvc.async.asyncresultwrapper. >c__displayclass4.b__3(iasyncresult ar)    at system.web.mvc.controller.endexecutecore(iasyncresult asyncresult)    at system.web.mvc.async.asyncresultwrapper. >c__displayclass4.b__3(iasyncresult ar)    at system.web.mvc.controller.endexecute(iasyncresult asyncresult)    at system.web.mvc.mvchandler. >c__displayclass8.b__3(iasyncresult asyncresult)    at system.web.mvc.async.asyncresultwrapper. >c__displayclass4.b__3(iasyncresult ar)    at system.web.mvc.mvchandler.endprocessrequest(iasyncresult asyncresult)    at system.web.httpapplication.callhandlerexecutionstep.system.web.httpapplication.iexecutionstep.execute()    at system.web.httpapplication.executestep(iexecutionstep step, boolean  completedsynchronously) -->
