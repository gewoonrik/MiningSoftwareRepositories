changing   column float disables responsive images  due to my project constrains, i have to change the float for columns in   3.2.0 from left to right - after doing so, images are no longer responsive.     i am using  img-responsive  class for my images as well. example:          section class="row"       section class="col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-lg-8"          img src=" " class="img-responsive" alt="image" /       /section       section class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4"          content      /section        section class="col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-lg-8"           img src=" " class="img-responsive" alt="image" /       /section       section class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4"           content      /section   /section       after applying a custom style :      .col-lg-x [where x is 1 to 12]{    float: right; }      images are no longer responsive. i am aware that i can use classes like  col-md-push-8  and  col-md-pull-4  instead of changing the float but it will make things more complicated.     thanks
