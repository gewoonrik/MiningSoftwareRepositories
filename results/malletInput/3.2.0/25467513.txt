are two copies of  .css supposed to be generated by compass when using  -sass?  i am trying to set up a ruby web project using  sinatra  (1.4.5),  slim  (2.0.3),  sass  (3.4.0) and   -sass  (3.2.0.1) gems.    since i am using sass, i decided to try out the  compass  (1.0.1) gem to automatically generate  .css  from my  .scss  files.    i followed directions on the   -sass github page  to use with compass, namely:    compass create my-new-project -r  -sass --using      however, i noticed that this always generates 2 copies of   .css  (which  git diff  tells me are the same except for file paths since they are in different directories):     ... (other files/directories get made and written) directory my-new-project/stylesheets/      write my-new-project/stylesheets/ / .css directory my-new-project/stylesheets/ /      write my-new-project/stylesheets/ / / .css      is this the intended behavior of this installation? if so, why are 2 copies of   .css  desirable? if not, how can i get compass to stop generating 2 copies?
