Bootstrap: Slide only one image among the multiple images in an item of the carousel  I am implementing the Bootstrap Carousel for making view multiple image thumbnail (4 images) in each carousel item. When I click on the next or prev control then it should slide only 1 image out of 4. How can I achieve this.    I already tried this example  suggested by skelly  but when I implement it shows only a single image on the carousel and when I click on the prev/next control then only one more image is showing besides the earlier one. I need Four images to be shown all the times. if 1 image from left is goes out then at the same time 1 more image should be inserted from the right. I added the "jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js" and " -3.2.0-dist/ .js" additionally but it didn't work.    my implemented code is as:         Any suggestion would be highly appreciated.
