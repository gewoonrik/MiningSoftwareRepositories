  3 not handling inline elements correctly on page resize  i've run into some trouble with   3.2.0. basically, i have a header menu with some  li  elements and inline with that i have a simple login form.    please see my code  here     the problem is that the css in not correctly handling the left and right floated elements    weirdly enough, everything seems to work when only a single input element is present, as you can see  here     please note that the html is taken directly from   examples at      -   .com/examples/jumbotron/ -   .com/examples/dashboard/      p.s. the jumbotron seems to work just fine with the login form but i'm guessing that is because there is no ul/li left floating menu    i'd appreciate any help you can offer    thank you     edit     hey guys and thank you for replies so far. i'm not sure whether this is the expected behaviour     ->       i.e. the login form is pushed to the next row, but i would expect it to collapse everything into a "mobile" type of menu before pushing the form down onto the next row.     edit 2     p.s. the screenshot above is from firefox 31.0 (and i see the same chrome version 36.0.1985.125 m)
