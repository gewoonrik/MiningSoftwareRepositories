.on('click') not playing well with dynamic content?  So I have some code here that dynamically generates a   navbar by prepending it to anything with a class of header_default. My problem is that I now want to do some .on('click') events to the dynamic navbar, although it's not really working. Specifically I've been trying to toggle some lorem ipsum when I press the brand part of the navbar. For some reason an on('click') alert will work fine this way, but nothing else will. I've tried .toggle(), .hide(), and console.log() but none of those work.      I have tested the same click event code on the same navbar when it isn't generated by javascript and it works fine.  I am still very new to using jquery/javascript, so I'm certain I've made a fairly obvious mistake here.    My HTML:
