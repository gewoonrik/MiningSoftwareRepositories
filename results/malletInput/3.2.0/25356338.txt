  modal returns to nowhere  I'm developing a C# EF application using Bootstrap 3.2.0.  I have a modal which renders a razor cshtml file.     ; the get method has no issue with that but when the post method returns it the browser renders an unformatted raw looking html page (the modal with no style), but still with no page "behind" it.    What can I do to rectify this, I need the modal to refresh with the model state error messages, but the close and cancel buttons still need to work.  This happens in Firefox, IE and the default Android (non-Chrome) browser.
