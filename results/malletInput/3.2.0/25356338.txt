  modal returns to nowhere  i'm developing a c# ef application using   3.2.0.  i have a modal which renders a razor cshtml file.      div id="createrestaurantmodal" class="modal fade" data-url='@url.action("createmodal", "restaurants")'       div id="restaurantcreatemodalcontainer"  /div   /div       with this between a   script  /script   pair.     $(document).ready(function () {     $('#restaurantcreate').click(function () {         var url = $('#createrestaurantmodal').data('url');         $.get(url, function (data) {             $('#restaurantcreatemodalcontainer').html(data);             $('#createrestaurantmodal').modal('show');         });     }); });      when it works there is no issue.  the get method fills in a couple of viewbag items for some dropdowns and the post method submits and the controller saves new data to the database.    but when something goes wrong and the post controller method returns the browser page renders the modal but without the original page "behind" it.  at this point the close x at the top right hand of the modal, and the cancel button do not work.  both using  data-dismiss="modal" .    in both the get and the post methods i use  return view() , i tried  return partialview() ; the get method has no issue with that but when the post method returns it the browser renders an unformatted raw looking html page (the modal with no style), but still with no page "behind" it.    what can i do to rectify this, i need the modal to refresh with the model state error messages, but the close and cancel buttons still need to work.  this happens in firefox, ie and the default android (non-chrome) browser.
