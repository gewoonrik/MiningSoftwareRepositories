  tooltip stops working after any other event runs  i'm using tooltips in   v3.2.0. they all work as they should when the page first loads, but if i do anything on the page that involves running som js code, they stop working. at least that's my first impression of the problem.    i initiate my tooltips like so:         as i said, the tooltip initially works, but when i do anything on the page that involves running some js, the tooltip stops working.    any ideas?
