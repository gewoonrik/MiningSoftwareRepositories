Bootstrap tooltip stops working after any other event runs  I'm using tooltips in Bootstrap v3.2.0. They all work as they should when the page first loads, but if I do anything on the page that involves running som js code, they stop working. At least that's my first impression of the problem.    I initiate my tooltips like so:         As I said, the tooltip initially works, but when I do anything on the page that involves running some js, the tooltip stops working.    Any ideas?
