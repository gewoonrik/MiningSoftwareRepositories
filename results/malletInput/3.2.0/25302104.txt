  tooltip stops working after any other event runs  i'm using tooltips in   v3.2.0. they all work as they should when the page first loads, but if i do anything on the page that involves running som js code, they stop working. at least that's my first impression of the problem.    i initiate my tooltips like so:     $('[data-toggle=tooltip]').tooltip();      and this is the code i use for a tooltip:      span class='my-tooltip' data-toggle='tooltip' data-placement='left' title='lorem ipsum dolor sit amet'  i class='fa fa-info'  /i  /span       as i said, the tooltip initially works, but when i do anything on the page that involves running some js, the tooltip stops working.    any ideas?
