why   not working in bluefish text editor?  i'm using a text editing software called bluefish version 2.2.6 and would like to use some of  s templates, but when i try to reference  .min.css it doesn't seem to work. i have saved my  -3.2.0-dist to my desktop. if anyone can help that would be great!    removed unrelated code from the body.
