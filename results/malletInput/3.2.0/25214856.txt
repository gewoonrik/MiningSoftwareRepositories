Why   not working in bluefish text editor?  I'm using a text editing software called BlueFish version 2.2.6 and would like to use some of Bootstraps templates, but when I try to reference  .min.css it doesn't seem to work. I have saved my  -3.2.0-dist to my desktop. If anyone can help that would be great!    Removed unrelated code from the body.
