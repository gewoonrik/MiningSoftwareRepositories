  v3.2.0 grid system layout  ok i'm probably missing something really simple here but i can not figure out why my cols are acting like this using    . this happens when i resize the browser to about 323px. i have no other css styles or html on the page. i have attached 2 screen shots for reference.      i have my columns set accordingly but when i resize the browser to the smallest size it drops the last col-xs-1 down one row.               here is the bootply :        what am i missing here ?
