Bootstrap v3.2.0 Grid system layout  Ok I'm probably missing something really simple here but I can not figure out why my cols are acting like this using twitter  . This happens when I resize the browser to about 323px. I have no other css styles or html on the page. I have attached 2 screen shots for reference.      I have my columns set accordingly but when I resize the browser to the smallest size it drops the last col-xs-1 down one row.               Here is the bootply :        What am I missing here ?
