how to use  -sass rake convert to create sass version of   v3.0.0  i have project that i scaffolded using yeoman with angular generator. i'm using the   sass functionality provided by    -sass . i have a   theme that i would like to use, which was built against   v3.0.0. the latest version of  -sass is v3.2.0 and there is no version in the repo that corresponds to   v.3.0.0. so i'm trying to follow the instructions at    -sass  under  upstream converter  to convert the   3.0.0 less into sass. when i run "rake convert", everything seems to work fine. however, when i run "rake convert[e8a1df5f060bf7e6631554648e0abde150aedbe4]" as listed in the example, i get following error from rake:         i'm not too familiar with ruby, so i'm not sure where to start. curious if anyone can get this to work. possibly there is something wrong with my ruby environment. my current ruby version is:    $ ruby -v    ruby 2.1.1p76 (2014-02-24 revision 45161) [x86_64-linux]    $ rake -v    rake, version 10.1.0
