  responsive design problems  at the minute i'm just getting myself used to the   framework, i understand the functionality of it but i'm not able to  get the results i desire.    simply on one row i want 2 sections side by side. first i want a div that contains nav nav-tabs which span 8 columns, then i want another div beside it containing some text with column span of 4.    here is my code below         am i missing something here? as when i use this i am left with the text below the nav tabs. any advice is greatly appreciated.
