  responsive design problems  at the minute i'm just getting myself used to the   framework, i understand the functionality of it but i'm not able to  get the results i desire.    simply on one row i want 2 sections side by side. first i want a div that contains nav nav-tabs which span 8 columns, then i want another div beside it containing some text with column span of 4.    here is my code below      div class= "row-fluid" id="projecttabs"       div class="span8"               br               ul class="nav nav-tabs"                   li class="active"  a data-toggle="tab" href="#" favourites /a  /li                   li  a data-toggle="tab" href="#" customer /a  /li                   li  a data-toggle="tab" href="#" non-chargeable /a  /li                   li  a data-toggle="tab" href="#" global /a  /li               /ul        /div       div class="span4"          this text is enclosed in a box.       /div   /div       i have included the following also:      div class="container-fluid"      link rel="stylesheet" href="  cdn.com/ /3.2.0/css/ .min.css"       link rel="stylesheet" href="  cdn.com/ /3.2.0/css/ -theme.min.css"       script src=" "  /script        meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"       am i missing something here? as when i use this i am left with the text below the nav tabs. any advice is greatly appreciated.
