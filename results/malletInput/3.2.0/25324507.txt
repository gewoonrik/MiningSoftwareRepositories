Bootstrap responsive design problems  At the minute I'm just getting myself used to the   framework, I understand the functionality of it but I'm not able to  get the results I desire.    Simply on one row I want 2 sections side by side. First I want a div that contains nav nav-tabs which span 8 columns, then I want another div beside it containing some text with column span of 4.    Here is my code below         Am I missing something here? As when I use this I am left with the text below the nav tabs. Any advice is greatly appreciated.
