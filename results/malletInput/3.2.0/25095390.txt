Bootstrap-datepicker does not visualize properly  I have a date-picker from  Bootstrap-Datepicker  and there is something wrong with it. I just want to show years but when I click on it, it shows like this  image .    This is my HTML code:           Does it happen to you anytime?    Note: I am using jQuery 2.1.1 and Bootstrap 3.2.0
