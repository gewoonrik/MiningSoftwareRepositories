rails 4 asset compilation is very slow (>1min) in dev mode. how to troubleshoot?  i am using a rails 4 app with  . at some point, the assets compilation got borked and now it it takes over a minute to reload a page if i make any changes to the scss files. changing the js files do not cause this delay. i have no idea what is causing this, but when i tried to just precompile the assets myself, the process takes about 2 seconds to complete. not sure why when it happens on the fly it takes over a minute, sometimes more than 2.     i'm using guard with livereload and when i save a change in a stylesheet, the page is livereloaded but without any stylesheet. if i reload the page, it takes over a minute to render. i'm hoping there's some obvious thing i'm just missing and someone spots it.     while troubleshooting, i switched the configuration so that the scss files are loaded in application.css.scss (with      rack-mini-test gem output:       is there anything else i could add? or any tests to run?
