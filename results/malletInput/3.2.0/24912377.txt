  form-horizontal vertical alignment of checkboxes without label text  i have changed from   3.0.0 to 3.2.0 this morning because i needed some of the new features for my web application. everything seemed to work as expected until i observed an issue with the vertical alignment of checkboxes in a  .form-horizontal  form.    an example is available at    . the markup for this minimum example is:      div class="form-horizontal"       div class="form-group"         label class="col-sm-2 control-label" with label text /label             div class="col-sm-10"               div class="checkbox"                 label                     input type="checkbox"  label text                /label               /div             /div       /div     div class="form-group"         label class="col-sm-2 control-label" without label text /label             div class="col-sm-10"               div class="checkbox"                 label                     input type="checkbox"                 /label               /div             /div       /div   /div       if a checkbox has no following text it is shifted below the row it should appear in.    is there a solution to this problem? since i already have the leading label i do not need a following text for my checkboxes. my current workaround is adding text to the   label   that contains the   input type="checkbox"   and use the background color as the font color to hide the text.    thank you for your help.
