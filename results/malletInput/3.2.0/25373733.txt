  dropdown menu not working, button only displays  i've seen a couple topics for this, but i am still unable to get it working.  the button for the dropdown appears correctly but when i click it to show the list of dropdowns, it directs me to "this page can't be displayed".    this is my code:         but i wanted to use the static paths instead of the sources located online.  also i checked that the paths were correct as i able to do another   tutorial with the same paths.  thanks in advance!
