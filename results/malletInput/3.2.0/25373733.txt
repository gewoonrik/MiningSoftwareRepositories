  dropdown menu not working, button only displays  i've seen a couple topics for this, but i am still unable to get it working.  the button for the dropdown appears correctly but when i click it to show the list of dropdowns, it directs me to "this page can't be displayed".    this is my code:      !doctype html   html lang="en"   head       meta charset="utf-8"       !-- set the viewport so this responsive site displays correctly on mobile devices --       meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"       title   3 responsive design tutorial | revillweb.com /title        !-- include   css --       link href="includes/ /css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet"       link href="includes/style.css" rel="stylesheet"    /head   body       !-- body page content --   div class="dropdown"       a id="dlabel" role="button" data-toggle="dropdown" data-target="#" href="/page.html"      dropdown  span class="caret"  /span       /a        ul class="dropdown-menu" role="menu" aria-labelledby="dlabel"           li  apple  /li           li  banana  /li           li  cherry  /li       /ul   /div    !-- include jquery and   js plugins --   script src="includes/jquery/jquery-2.1.0.min.js"  /script   script src="includes/ /js/ .min.js"  /script    /body   /html       i fixed this by changing:      script src="includes/jquery/jquery-2.1.0.min.js"  /script   script src="includes/ /js/ .min.js"  /script       to      script src=" "  /script   script src="  cdn.com/ /3.2.0/js/ .min.js"  /script       but i wanted to use the static paths instead of the sources located online.  also i checked that the paths were correct as i able to do another   tutorial with the same paths.  thanks in advance!
