bootswatch theme that looks the same as on the website  i am trying to get the same theme working as here:        however i would like to use the cdn version of  /bootswatch. one is available here:    cdn.com/  they also host the "yeti" theme that i would like to use.    however i am unable to get it working the way i think it should be.    what i have so far:      !doctype html   html       head           title   cdn /title           meta charset="utf-8"            link href="  cdn.com/bootswatch/3.2.0/yeti/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet"       /head        body            !-- main container --           div class="container"               div class="page-header"                 h1 id="type" typography /h1               /div           /div            script src=" "  /script           script src="  cdn.com/ /3.2.0/js/ .min.js"  /script       /body    /html       for simplicity, i would like to only show a title for now. but that title looks different than the one from the     website. especially the font size. what i have to do in order to make it look the same is to add this line to the header:      link href=" " rel="stylesheet"       but i think this css is some kind of internal bootswatch css file that is hosted for the bootswatch.com website itself only and should not be used.    of course i could download the bootswatch.min.css file and load it in the header. however, as it is nowhere stated to do that, i think this is the wrong way? what am i missing?    thanks for any hints!
