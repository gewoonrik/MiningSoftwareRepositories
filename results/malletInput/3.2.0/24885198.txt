Bootswatch theme that looks the same as on the website  I am trying to get the same theme working as here:        However I would like to use the CDN version of  /bootswatch. One is available here:    cdn.com/  They also host the "yeti" theme that I would like to use.    However I am unable to get it working the way I think it should be.    What I have so far:         But I think this css is some kind of internal bootswatch css file that is hosted for the bootswatch.com website itself only and should not be used.    Of course I could download the bootswatch.min.css file and load it in the header. However, as it is nowhere stated to do that, I think this is the wrong way? What am I missing?    Thanks for any hints!
