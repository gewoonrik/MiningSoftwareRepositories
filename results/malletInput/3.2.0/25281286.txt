  3.2.0 glyphicons are not displaying in internet explorer  I am useing twitter   3.2.0 and I use some glyphicons they work properly in ff, chrome, and opera but they are not displayed within the Internet Explorer.     The strange thing is, if i open the get .com website and look at the "Components" section, even there they aren't displayed properly, so I doubt any implementing issues on my side.    Does anybody else have a similiar issue?? Or is knowing something about this behaviour?     Here is a Scrennshot of how it looks in my Internet Explorer 11
