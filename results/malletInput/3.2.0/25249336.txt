What are the major migration issues between Bootstrap 3.0.3 and 3.2.0?  We've inherited a Bootstrap dashboard that is in BS 3.0.3, and we'd like to be using 3.2.0, but not if it is going to create a lot of development time to migrate it.  I was just curious if anyone had some guidance with regards to migration, it's a pretty complex dashboard.
