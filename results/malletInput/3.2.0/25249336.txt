what are the major migration issues between   3.0.3 and 3.2.0?  we've inherited a   dashboard that is in bs 3.0.3, and we'd like to be using 3.2.0, but not if it is going to create a lot of development time to migrate it.  i was just curious if anyone had some guidance with regards to migration, it's a pretty complex dashboard.
