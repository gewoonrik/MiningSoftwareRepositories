Bootstrap Off Canvas - if content less than sidebar messed up scrolling  I am using Bootstrap's 3.2.0 Off Canvas layout located at -    .com/examples/offcanvas/     I know this is a common issue that if the content of the sidebar is longer than the content of the main container that the scroll bar no longer scrolls the content properly (both sidebar and main) but cuts off the sidebar and also places the scrollbar below the navbar.     I can reproduce this problem by taking the above template and adding additional links to the sidebar while putting less content in the main container, example:         Is there anyway to reliably have the sidebar working no matter how long the main content is?
