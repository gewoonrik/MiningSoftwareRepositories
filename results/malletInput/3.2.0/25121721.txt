jquery with validation plugin not working  after having spent hours trying to solve a seemingly simple problem (being walking through stackoverflow questions...), here i am once more obliged to turn to stackoverflow and submit my issue...i have a very basic form just two controls: a text input and a submit bottom. i am trying to get the jquery validation plugin to work. here is my code:         jquery.validate.js is version 1.11.1    my understanding is that if i submit the form with blank text input i must receive the message "please enter your first name". but nothing happens and the form submits normally. i cannot figure out what i am doing wrong. the case is fairly simple. thank you in advance for whatever help and/or direction you may give me.
