jquery with validation plugin not working  After having spent hours trying to solve a seemingly simple problem (being walking through stackoverflow questions...), here I am once more obliged to turn to stackoverflow and submit my issue...I have a very basic form just two controls: a text input and a submit bottom. I am trying to get the jquery validation plugin to work. Here is my code:         jquery.validate.js is version 1.11.1    My understanding is that if i submit the form with blank text input I must receive the message "Please enter your first name". But nothing happens and the form submits normally. I cannot figure out what I am doing wrong. The case is fairly simple. Thank you in advance for whatever help and/or direction you may give me.
