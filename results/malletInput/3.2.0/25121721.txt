jquery with validation plugin not working  after having spent hours trying to solve a seemingly simple problem (being walking through stackoverflow questions...), here i am once more obliged to turn to stackoverflow and submit my issue...i have a very basic form just two controls: a text input and a submit bottom. i am trying to get the jquery validation plugin to work. here is my code:       html xmlns=" "    head runat="server"    title  /title             script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"  /script   script src="//maxcdn. cdn.com/ /3.2.0/js/ .min.js"   /script   script src="jquery.validate.js"  /script    script       $(function () {          $('#frm').validate({              rules: {                 txtinput: {                     required:"reuired"                 }             },             messages:{                 txtinput:"please enter your first name"             }         });      });   /script    /head   body       form id="frm" name="frm" method="post"           div               input id="txtinput" type="text" placeholder="name" /           /div           br /               input id="btn" type="submit" class="btn btn-danger" value="submit" /       /form            /body       /html       jquery.validate.js is version 1.11.1    my understanding is that if i submit the form with blank text input i must receive the message "please enter your first name". but nothing happens and the form submits normally. i cannot figure out what i am doing wrong. the case is fairly simple. thank you in advance for whatever help and/or direction you may give me.
