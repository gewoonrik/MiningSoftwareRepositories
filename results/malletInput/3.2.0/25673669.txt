  3 glyphicon display as boxes intermittently?  i'm working on a site that links to the maxcdn version of   3.2.0.  i'm seeing an issue on a mac in chrome v37 where at times the page will load and in place of the font icons, a box is displayed. on hover over the box, the icon is then rendered. so debugging via developer tools is difficult. the browser behaves as though it doesn't understand the icons until a redraw by the browser.
