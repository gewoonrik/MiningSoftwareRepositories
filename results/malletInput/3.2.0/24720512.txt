how to get rid of gap on top of right column when left nav column is affix-top?  this is my first time using  . there is a big gap on top of my col-sm-9 column always present before the left-side col-sm-3 nav is changed from  affix-top  to  affix  when the user moves past a small top banner.    i think all the features i have created this strange problem with my added css and js.  the page has a top nav bar that is affixed to the top also when the top banner is moved out of screen (when the user moves down the page). finally, there is a scroll-spy on the left side nav.    i have   version 3.2.0.  you can  see the code and the problem in this jsfiddle .        div class="container"     div class="row"        div class="col-sm-3" id="leftsidenav"         ul class="nav nav-stacked"          ...  !-- this left-side nav is affixed and has scroll-spy --         /ul       /div        div class="col-sm-9" id="rightcontent"        this is the section that has a gap on top!      /div    ...      no matter what i tried, i could not get rid of the gap on top of my col-sm-9. can anyone help me out?     update:      based on your initial responses, note that i would like the leftsidenav to stay affixed to the left side and rightcontent to its right side  even after the user scrolls down . the reason i put in the margins and width is to prevent the leftsidenav completely getting covered by rightcontent after scrolling down.      basically, you have to check scrolling down. this is the   jsfiddle with my margin setting and gap problem  . then compared to this is the   jsfiddle without the margin setting but has the covering problem  .
