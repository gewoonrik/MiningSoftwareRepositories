how to get rid of gap on top of right column when left nav column is affix-top?  this is my first time using  . there is a big gap on top of my col-sm-9 column always present before the left-side col-sm-3 nav is changed from      no matter what i tried, i could not get rid of the gap on top of my col-sm-9. can anyone help me out?     update:      based on your initial responses, note that i would like the leftsidenav to stay affixed to the left side and rightcontent to its right side  even after the user scrolls down . the reason i put in the margins and width is to prevent the leftsidenav completely getting covered by rightcontent after scrolling down.      basically, you have to check scrolling down. this is the   jsfiddle with my margin setting and gap problem  . then compared to this is the   jsfiddle without the margin setting but has the covering problem  .
