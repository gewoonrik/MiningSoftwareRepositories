  modal goes "behind" the backdrop and users can't clic?  i'm using   3.2.0 and the modal plugin. i'm having an issue with the modal going behind the body "backdrop". it's not the first time i've used this plugin; i never had any problem before.          here is the page showing the problem  (click inquire about in the lower-right of the page).    it think it's a  z-index  issue. page structure:         body          !-- canvas wrapping entirely the content (z-index: 2) --          div class="canvas canvas-property-show"              !-- the modal (z-index: 1050) --              div id="modal-iframe-inquiry"  /div          /div           !-- navmenu shown only on small viewport (z-index: 1) --          div class="navmenu navmenu-adp navmenu-fixed-left"  /div      /body       modal  #modal-iframe-inquiry  has a default  z-index  of 1050.    if i remove the  .navmenu  from the dom and remove the  z-index  property from  .canvas   solves the problem .
