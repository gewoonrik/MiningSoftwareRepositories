Why is my Bootstrap Carousel not moving from the second slide?  I am using Bootstrap 2.1.1 for a site. When adding a slideshow using the Bootstrap Carousel plugin, the slideshow ends after reaching the final slide, instead of looping. This was apparently a bug in Bootstrap 2.x that was resolved in Bootstrap 3.    A full-site upgrade to Bootstrap 3 is not currently feasible, so I updated just the Carousel plugin.    However, this has lead to an issue where the first slide transitions to the second, but then the slideshow stops.    This JavaScript error occurs:    Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function js_plugins:482 (equivalent 147)    Here is the HTML markup:         Thanks for your help.
