  modal - hide one then show another  i've been using jqueryui for a long time now but have recently made the switch to   for aesthetic reasons.  i am now struggling with what i would expect to be a simple issue and wondered if it's something that others more familiar with   can help me with.    i have a generic function for creating dialogs on-the-fly and there are occasions where i show a dialog with no buttons (when processing something), and then swap it to a dialog that does have buttons (process complete - click ok, for example).  i'm not trying to define a set process here so i'm basically saying i want to be able to close one dialog and open another whenever needed.  this is where the problem comes in.    with   the dialogs animate in and out, and i like that and want to keep it.  i don't want to do it when swapping dialogs though.  i can do this by removing the class
