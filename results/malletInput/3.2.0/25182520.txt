Bootstrap modal - hide one then show another  I've been using jQueryUI for a long time now but have recently made the switch to Bootstrap for aesthetic reasons.  I am now struggling with what I would expect to be a simple issue and wondered if it's something that others more familiar with Bootstrap can help me with.    I have a generic function for creating dialogs on-the-fly and there are occasions where I show a dialog with no buttons (when processing something), and then swap it to a dialog that does have buttons (process complete - click OK, for example).  I'm not trying to define a set process here so I'm basically saying I want to be able to close one dialog and open another whenever needed.  This is where the problem comes in.    With Bootstrap the dialogs animate in and out, and I like that and want to keep it.  I don't want to do it when swapping dialogs though.  I can do this by removing the class
