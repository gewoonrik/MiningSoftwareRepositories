  modal - hide one then show another  i've been using jqueryui for a long time now but have recently made the switch to   for aesthetic reasons.  i am now struggling with what i would expect to be a simple issue and wondered if it's something that others more familiar with   can help me with.    i have a generic function for creating dialogs on-the-fly and there are occasions where i show a dialog with no buttons (when processing something), and then swap it to a dialog that does have buttons (process complete - click ok, for example).  i'm not trying to define a set process here so i'm basically saying i want to be able to close one dialog and open another whenever needed.  this is where the problem comes in.    with   the dialogs animate in and out, and i like that and want to keep it.  i don't want to do it when swapping dialogs though.  i can do this by removing the class  fade  from the first dialog when it shows, and from the second dialog before it shows, and that works great.  i then add the class to the second dialog so that it will animate out.  however, the animation goes wrong when i do this and there's an ugly flash where the background div should fade out gently.    i've put together a jsfiddle to demonstrate the issue.  you can click the close button on the first dialog to see what the fade out animation  should  look like.    any help would be appreciated before i start digging into the   source files.            tl;dr     look at the jsfiddle - click "show dialog 2" - click "ok".  i want to get rid of the black flash at the end.     css      @import url("//maxcdn. cdn.com/ /3.2.0/css/ .min.css"); .modal {     display: none; }       html       div id="dialog1" class="modal fade"     div class="modal-dialog"       div class="modal-content"         div class="modal-header"           h4 class="modal-title" modal dialog 1 /h4         /div         div class="modal-body" this is the first modal dialog /div         div class="modal-footer"           button type="button" id="dialog-ok" class="btn btn-default" show dialog 2 /button                     button type="button" id="dialog-close" class="btn btn-default" data-dismiss="modal" close /button                   /div       /div     /div   /div    div id="dialog2" class="modal"     div class="modal-dialog"       div class="modal-content"         div class="modal-header"           h4 class="modal-title" modal dialog 2 /h4         /div         div class="modal-body" this is the second modal dialog /div         div class="modal-footer"           button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-dismiss="modal" ok /button                   /div       /div     /div   /div        javascript      function showdialog2() {     $("#dialog1").removeclass("fade").modal("hide");     $("#dialog2").modal("show").addclass("fade"); }  $("#dialog1").modal("show");  $("#dialog-ok").on("click", function() {     showdialog2(); });
