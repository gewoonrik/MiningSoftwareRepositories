Bootstrap navbar collapsible on mobile  I'm using Bootstrap v3.2.0 with the non-responsive feature. I want the mobile view to be the same as the desktop view. I've managed to achieve this but the collapsible navbar is not working on mobiles or tablets.    I have multiple menu items with have dropdown style links wich works on desktop (on mouse-over) but when I click on them from a mobile device it won't open the dropdown items.    Any ideas?
