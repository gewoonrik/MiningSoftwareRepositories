  navbar collapsible on mobile  i'm using   v3.2.0 with the non-responsive feature. i want the mobile view to be the same as the desktop view. i've managed to achieve this but the collapsible navbar is not working on mobiles or tablets.    i have multiple menu items with have dropdown style links wich works on desktop (on mouse-over) but when i click on them from a mobile device it won't open the dropdown items.    any ideas?
