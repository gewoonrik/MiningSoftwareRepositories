Bootstrap - Radio buttons displaying as a box  I have a Fiddle   here  ...     In the fiddle, the radio buttons are displaying correctly.          However, in the website I'm working on, located   here  , the radio buttons are displaying as tiny boxes, that are unclickable.     This is the Bootstrap CDN I'm using -        cdn.com/ /3.2.0/css/ .min.css      Additionally, this website works locally, but not once I get in on my server.     Ideas?
