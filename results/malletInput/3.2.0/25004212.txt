  - radio buttons displaying as a box  i have a fiddle   here  ...     in the fiddle, the radio buttons are displaying correctly.       div class="element-radio" title="do you want to float the text to the left, right, or not at all?"  h4 class="title" style="font-weight: bold;" float (left, right or none) /h4              div class="column column3"           label               input type="radio" name="radio" value="left" /                   span left /span           /label       /div       span class="clearfix"  /span       div class="column column3"           label  input type="radio" name="radio" value="right" /               span right /span           /label       /div       span class="clearfix"  /span       div class="column column3"           label               input type="radio" name="radio" value="none" /                   span none /span           /label       /div       span class="clearfix"  /span       /div       however, in the website i'm working on, located   here  , the radio buttons are displaying as tiny boxes, that are unclickable.     this is the   cdn i'm using -        cdn.com/ /3.2.0/css/ .min.css      additionally, this website works locally, but not once i get in on my server.     ideas?
