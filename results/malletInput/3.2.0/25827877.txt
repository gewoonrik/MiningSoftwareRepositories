render new data of modal inside modal php, jquery  i have a mysql database of a bible that i query via php. right now i'm in the testing phase. below is my test file where i display a specific chapter of a book in a modal. the problem is that i have no idea how to essentially 'display the next chapter (or previous chapter)' when a user clicks the left or right arrow buttons on the footer of the modal.    currently the test file shows "genesis 12". how can i allow the user to see genesis 13 (inside the same modal) when the user clicks the right arrow button (at the bottom)?         .. any help will be greatly appreciated!!
