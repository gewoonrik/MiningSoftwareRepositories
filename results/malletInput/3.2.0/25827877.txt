Render new data of modal inside modal PHP, jQuery  I have a MySQL database of a bible that I query via php. Right now i'm in the testing phase. Below is my test file where I display a specific Chapter of a Book in a modal. The problem is that I have no idea how to essentially 'display the next chapter (or previous chapter)' when a user clicks the left or right arrow buttons on the footer of the modal.    Currently the test file shows "Genesis 12". How can I allow the user to see Genesis 13 (inside the same modal) when the user clicks the right arrow button (at the bottom)?         .. Any help will be greatly appreciated!!
