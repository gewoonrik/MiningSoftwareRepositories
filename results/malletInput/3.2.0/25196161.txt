cannot read property 'slice' of undefined when applying carousel from   on wordpress  i am trying to use carousel.js from   on wordpress. i use a simple wordpress theme-- twenty fourteen  and then add the above code into a new page. no other js file is included.  it doesn't work for me on both safari and chrome.      it is frustrating to see the this:         the slides works well when turning left. however, when it comes to right end, it would trigger an error message and then doesn't work again!      besides, the code above does work when i just put it into a individual html file(without influence of wordpress).            sorry for image missing here(since my reputation is less than 10)    here is the test code:         link href="  cdn.com/ /3.2.0/css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet"      script src=" "  /script   script src="  cdn.com/ /3.2.0/js/ .min.js"  /script    div id="carousel-example-generic" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel"     !-- indicators --     ol class="carousel-indicators"       li data-target="#carousel-example-generic" data-slide-to="0" class="active"  /li       li data-target="#carousel-example-generic" data-slide-to="1"  /li       li data-target="#carousel-example-generic" data-slide-to="2"  /li     /ol      !-- wrapper for slides --     div class="carousel-inner"       div class="item active"         img src=" " alt="..."         div class="carousel-caption"           h3 image 1 /h3           p this is my first image! /p         /div       /div       div class="item"         img src=" " alt="..."         div class="carousel-caption"           h3 image 2 /h3           p this is my second image! /p         /div       /div       div class="item"         img src=" " alt="..."         div class="carousel-caption"           h3 image 3 /h3           p this is my third image! /p         /div       /div     /div      !-- controls --     a class="left carousel-control" href="#carousel-example-generic" role="button" data-slide="prev"       span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"  /span     /a     a class="right carousel-control" href="#carousel-example-generic" role="button" data-slide="next"       span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"  /span     /a   /div       can anyone explain why does it happen? thanks in advance!!
