  3.2.0 nested input in label width  i have       div class="form-group"       label class="control-label"          last name          input style="font-weight: normal;" required maxlength="50" type="text" class="form-control" name="lastname"       /label   /div       the input width is 210px in firefox, 177px in chrome, but i can't find the constant in the css after inspecting the element. the label "last name" is much thinner than 210px. if i change the label to a very long string, the input's width will adjust accordingly(100%). however, i'm looking for where the minimum width is defined. i am using this markup so that i don't need to give the label a for attribute equal to the id of its input. i could easily explicitly set the width, but i'm just curious where this value came from. if these are browser styles, then how can i view them?
