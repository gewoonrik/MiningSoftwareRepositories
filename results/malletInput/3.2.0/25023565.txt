  3.2.0 nested input in label width  I have          The input width is 210px in Firefox, 177px in Chrome, but I can't find the constant in the css after inspecting the element. The label "Last name" is much thinner than 210px. If I change the label to a very long string, the input's width will adjust accordingly(100%). However, I'm looking for where the minimum width is defined. I am using this markup so that I don't need to give the label a for attribute equal to the id of its input. I could easily explicitly set the width, but I'm just curious where this value came from. If these are browser styles, then how can I view them?
