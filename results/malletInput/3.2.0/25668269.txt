right aligned control labels in form-horizontal  i'm trying to do a two-column form that behaves as follows with     (3.2.0):      on extra-small (xs) screens, the second column is shown below the first column, control labels are shown above the input fields   on small (sm) screens, the two columns are shown beside each other, control labels are shown above the input fields   one medium (md) screens, the two columns are shown beside each other, control labels are horizontally aligned with their input fields      my code below (also at    ) works with one issue:  on small screens, the control labels are shown above their input fields, but they are right aligned (instead of proper left alignment).    the cause of this is that   in  forms.less  switches on right alignment based on a media query:      form-horizontal {   @media (min-width: @screen-sm-min) {     .control-label {       text-align: right;       margin-bottom: 0;       padding-top: (@padding-base-vertical + 1); // default padding plus a border     }   }      is there a way i can teach   to use a different media query (say for  @screen-md-min ) without having to modify the   source itself, i.e., by overriding it in another less file that has an  @import " /less/ .less" ?  especially is it possible to do this in a way that i'm not actually querying the screen width but rather the width of the current column?  (otherwise it would affect other forms that have a single column layout and still align horizontally as well.)  or are there any other, better ways to achieve the responsive behavior i described?          div class="container-fluid"           form class="form-horizontal" role="form" action="#"               div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6"                   div class="form-group col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12"                       label class="control-label col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-3" first name /label                       div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-9"                           input type="email" class="form-control" placeholder="enter email"/                       /div                   /div                    div class="form-group col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12"                       label class="control-label col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-3" last name /label                       div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-9"                           textarea class="form-control"                           /textarea                       /div                   /div               /div                div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6"                   div class="form-group col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12"                       label class="control-label col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-3" phone number /label                       div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-9"                           textarea class="form-control"                           /textarea                       /div                   /div                    div class="form-group col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12"                       label class="control-label col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-3" remarks /label                       div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-9"                           input type="email" class="form-control" placeholder="enter email"/                       /div                   /div               /div           /form       /div
