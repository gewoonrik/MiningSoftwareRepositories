How can I avoid that bower installs automatically packages I do not need?  I have installed angular-strap bower package.    angular-strap has no dependency to jquery or   just the  .css files not more.    When I do a bower update and all packages are updated then bower downloads and installs the:      3.2 package although I do not need that because I use a cdn for   3.2 css files !!!    This is what I get after 'bower update':         How can I remove   bower package without getting the "cannot read property 'main'..." message again which prevents me from building my code with grunt?
