how can i avoid that bower installs automatically packages i do not need?  i have installed angular-strap bower package.    angular-strap has no dependency to jquery or   just the  .css files not more.    when i do a bower update and all packages are updated then bower downloads and installs the:      3.2 package although i do not need that because i use a cdn for   3.2 css files !!!    this is what i get after 'bower update':         how can i remove   bower package without getting the "cannot read property 'main'..." message again which prevents me from building my code with grunt?
