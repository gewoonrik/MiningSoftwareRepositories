Some features of a Bootstrap calendar do not work  I'm trying to implement this Bootstrap 3 calendar:  http:// -calendar.azurewebsites.net/index-bs3.html  (you can of course see its innards by looking at the source)    However, there are problems. Firstly, the checkbox to toggle modals do not work. Rather, to enable modals, one has to first click a day in the calendar (to get the black dropdown menu), and then they are enabled.    Secondly, the navigational buttons (week, day, month, prev, next, today) do not work at all. No error is caught. Only this warning:
