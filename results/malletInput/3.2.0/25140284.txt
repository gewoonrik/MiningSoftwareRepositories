vertical align middle content with   3  i want to set vertical middle content in div block with latest    v3.2.0 .    i have read the answer to  vertical-align with   3 , but it uses  float:none;  in div block.     however, i  can't  use  float:none;  in div block according to our layout.     i have this code:       div class="container"     div class="col-lg-4" .... /div     div class="col-lg-5" .... /div     div class="col-lg-3" .... /div   /div       content height is dynamic in block 1. i want to set vertical middle content in block 2 and 3 according to block 1 height.     this is how our layout currently looks:             block 1           block 2            block 3  ------------------ ------------------ ------------------ |  content height  |      content     |      content     | |        is        |------------------ ------------------ |     dynamic      |   ------------------        if, i will use  float:none;  so, this is our layout looks:             block 1           block 2          ------------------ ------------------  |  content height  |                  | |        is        |      content     | |     dynamic      |                  |  ------------------ ------------------         block 3  ------------------ |      content     |  ------------------       this is how i would like it to look:             block 1           block 2            block 3  ------------------ ------------------ ------------------ |  content height  |                  |                  | |        is        |      content     |      content     | |     dynamic      |                  |                  |  ------------------ ------------------ ------------------
