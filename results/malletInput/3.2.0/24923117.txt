how to prevent   navbar toggle from pushing down content?  i am using   with a static top navbar like so:      nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-top" role="navigation"     div class="container"     ...    /div   /nav       in it's latest version 3.2.0, the   navbar toggle unfortunately pushes down the content on small screens, when the menu is triggered.    how can this behaviour be prevented, i.e. keep the content static and let the mobile menu overlay the content like it used to be in previous versions?
