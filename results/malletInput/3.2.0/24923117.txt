How to prevent Bootstrap Navbar Toggle from pushing down content?  I am using Bootstrap with a static top navbar like so:         In it's latest version 3.2.0, the Bootstrap navbar toggle unfortunately pushes down the content on small screens, when the menu is triggered.    How can this behaviour be prevented, i.e. keep the content static and let the mobile menu overlay the content like it used to be in previous versions?
