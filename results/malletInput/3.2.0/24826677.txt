Bootstrap Carousel not cycling after first click  Have just updated my carousel.js to 3.2.0 as the previous version active class was applying after the item had slid.    Here is my markup.         So basically what is happening now is that it works on the first slide interaction, either clicking the indicators or controls, but then it stops working.    Nothing shows up in the console either.    Any ideas?
