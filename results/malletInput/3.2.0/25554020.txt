  carousel with photos: optimal image size?  i am experimenting with    's carousel and would like to use it with photographs.      question: what is the optimal size for the pictures i should upload for use on the carousel?     in the current   distribution (v3.2.0) the example  carousel.html  uses a simple 1x1 pixel image as a background:      img src="data:image/gif;base64,r0lgodlhaqabaiaaahd3dwaaach5baaaaaaalaaaaaabaaeaaaicraeaow==" alt="first slide"       i couldn't find this documented and the photos i have experimented with get stretched/distorted on my laptop screen.
