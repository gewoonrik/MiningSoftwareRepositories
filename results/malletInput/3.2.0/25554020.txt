  carousel with photos: optimal image size?  I am experimenting with  Bootstrap 's carousel and would like to use it with photographs.      Question: What is the optimal size for the pictures I should upload for use on the carousel?     In the current Bootstrap distribution (v3.2.0) the example  carousel.html  uses a simple 1x1 pixel image as a background:         I couldn't find this documented and the photos I have experimented with get stretched/distorted on my laptop screen.
