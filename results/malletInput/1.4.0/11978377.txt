  text fields have suddenly shrunk  evening all,    i have a site which uses    , with the same css styles as a previous site so i am familiar with how things should look.    i ran bundle update, and suddenly all of the text fields, not areas, have shrunk in height, and no matter what css i code, i can't touch them. also the logo has drifted to the left of the page.     many similar questions suggest changing the doctype which i have tried to no avail.    css code for forms as follows;         if you need more code just ask, but any thoughts would be greatly appreciated! cheers andy
