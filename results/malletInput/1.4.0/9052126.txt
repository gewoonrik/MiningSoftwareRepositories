How can I toggle this with jQuery  Twitter Bootstrap    /javascript.html#dropdown  has a dropdown.js library (at    /1.4.0/ -dropdown.js  )that will change the "dropdown" class below to "dropdown open" which will make the dropdown menu open.     I included the js file on my local site but it's not opening or toggling.  I don't know if I have to add an extra method to tell the jquery file what element to select, or, if I just give the element class "dropdown" the js should work without anything more.     I tried to figure it out using Firebug on the Twitter Bootstrap demo but I'm not that experienced with it. Please let me know if you know how to use this. Thank you.     I'm using it on a Rails application but that shouldn't make a difference. It includes jquery automatically, and, as I said, I added dropdown.js. I'm just wondering if I have to do something more...
