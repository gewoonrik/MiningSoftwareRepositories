jQuery TextEditor doesn't work?  So I'm trying to install jQuery TextEditor to my CodeIgniter project. I was wondering why is it not working. BTW: My project also uses Bootstrap. Can someone tell me why the plugin won't work? I've got the files on the right places already so I don't think it is because the browser couldn't find my file. Please help.    head:         The class in the Textarea is called "Jqte-test" because that was what on the demo page of jQueryTE. I don't really understand how they made it work while I can't. All answers will be greatly appreciated.
