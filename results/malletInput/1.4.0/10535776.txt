how to load the latest version of    i saw someone referencing:       http:// .github.com/ /1.4.0/ .min.css        but what i'd like to do is load "the latest" of version 1, similar to how google cdn includes all the versions of a library along with "the latest" one.    q: is there something that i can load like:         http:// .github.com/ /1/ .min.css       to get the latest version 1 of    ?
