@import " " cannot resolve import into sass/scss  making a small ror application and have run into a interesting issue via importing   using the asset manager.    very simply,    in my gem file i have      source '  '2.0.0'  gem 'rails', '4.0.5' gem ' -sass' gem 'sprockets', '2.11.0' gem 'bcrypt-ruby' gem 'faker' gem 'will_paginate' gem ' -will_paginate' gem 'simplecov'  group :development, :test do   gem 'sqlite3'   gem 'rspec-rails' end  group :test do   gem 'selenium-webdriver', '2.35.1'   gem 'capybara', '2.1.0'   gem 'factory_girl_rails'   gem 'cucumber-rails', '1.4.0', :require =  false   gem 'database_cleaner', github: 'bmabey/database_cleaner' end  gem 'sass-rails' gem 'uglifier' gem 'coffee-rails' gem 'jquery-rails' gem 'turbolinks' gem 'jbuilder'  group :doc do   gem 'sdoc', '0.3.20', require: false end      i created a custom.css.scss file and added the line:     @import " ";      the issue is, my ide (rubymine) tells me that it cannot resolve the import of   but the file compiles and runs.    however, when is start the server,   only half works i.e. some of the styling is applied but a lot of it isn't.    i am at a loss of how to fix this unless i use a relative path + the   folder but im trying to avoid that.     link to the repo below:
