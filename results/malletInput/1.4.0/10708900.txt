 -sass > ie_hex_str not interpreted during assets precompilation  i run into a quite strange issue :    i'm working with :      rails 3.1.1    -sass 1.4.4 (didn't have time to upgrade to 2.0 yet)      an known issue in previous  -sass 1.4.0 was the one described  here  relating to ie gradients displays. this was fixed in 1.4.3 by the introduction (from what i understood) of ie_hex_str function and specific filters for ie like :         that is the ie_hex_str was not interpreted when compiling the assets. i didn't touch any of the  -sass code so i don't understand what's going on...    any idea ?     update :     the "funny" thing is that i have 2 applications using the same versions of rails and  -sass and doing pretty much the same thing and they don't react the same way. for one  the ie_hex_str is correctly interpreted.
