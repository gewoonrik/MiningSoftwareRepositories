Bootstrap-sass > ie_hex_str not interpreted during assets precompilation  I run into a quite strange issue :    I'm working with :      Rails 3.1.1   Bootstrap-sass 1.4.4 (didn't have time to upgrade to 2.0 yet)      An known issue in previous  -sass 1.4.0 was the one described  here  relating to IE gradients displays. This was fixed in 1.4.3 by the introduction (from what I understood) of ie_hex_str function and specific filters for IE like :         That is the ie_hex_str was not interpreted when compiling the assets. I didn't touch any of the  -sass code so I don't understand what's going on...    Any idea ?     UPDATE :     The "funny" thing is that I have 2 applications using the same versions of rails and  -sass and doing pretty much the same thing and they don't react the same way. For one  the ie_hex_str is correctly interpreted.
