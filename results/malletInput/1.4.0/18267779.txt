how do i switch from using the  - -rails gem to using normal    i have a rails app that was built with the   rails gem for development, but now i am going to start doing design and styling stuff and i would rather just move to referencing   normally/locally. the app is based on  the rails3- -devise-cancan template .    i tried just removing the  -sass gem and then deleting all of the stylesheets and .js files in /assets, and replacing the application.css and application.js with  .css and  .js. but when i launch the application, i can see it is grabbing certain things from  , but the formatting is wrong and a lot of interface things don't work.    what is the easiest cleanest way to make the switch?     source '  'rails', '3.2.13' gem 'sqlite3' gem 'mysql2' group :assets do   gem 'sass-rails',   '~  3.2.3'   gem 'coffee-rails', '~  3.2.1'   gem 'uglifier', ' = 1.0.3' end gem "rspec-rails", " = 2.12.2", :group =  [:development, :test] gem "database_cleaner", " = 1.0.0.rc1", :group =  :test gem "email_spec", " = 1.4.0", :group =  :test gem "cucumber-rails", " = 1.3.1", :group =  :test, :require =  false gem "launchy", " = 2.2.0", :group =  :test gem "capybara", " = 2.0.3", :group =  :test gem "factory_girl_rails", " = 4.2.0", :group =  [:development, :test] gem " -sass", " = 2.3.0.0" gem "devise", " = 2.2.3" gem "cancan", " = 1.6.9" gem "rolify", " = 3.2.0" gem "simple_form", " = 2.1.0" gem "quiet_assets", " = 1.0.2", :group =  :development gem "figaro", " = 0.6.3" gem "better_errors", " = 0.7.2", :group =  :development gem "binding_of_caller", " = 0.7.1", :group =  :development, :platforms =  [:mri_19, :rbx] gem 'execjs' gem 'jquery-rails' gem 'jquery-ui-rails'
