Toggle Chosen Select With JQuery Validate Plugin  I've been researching and wrestling with this for days, so finally I turn to StackOverflow when I'm at my wits' end! Here's what I am trying to accomplish:    When a user toggles a radio button, it enables a Chosen select, and if they do or do not make a selection, jQuery Validate works accordingly - i.e.: if the Chosen select is disabled, jQuery Validate ignores it, and if it's enabled, it checks to see an option is selected. If the user has the Chosen Select enabled, but then decides to remove an option and does NOT toggle the Chosen Select via the radio button to disable it, I want the validation to trigger.    So far, it works fine until you perform the following steps:      First, click "No" to enable the Chosen select. Hitting submit will trigger the validation as expected.   Next, add an option to the select - now the form validates correctly.   Then, remove the option - again, the validation triggers as expected.   Now toggle the radio button to "Yes" - the field will disable, but the validation error message will not dismiss (minor issue)   Toggle the radio back to "No", do not select anything in the Chosen select, and hit submit - validation does not trigger again. Additionally, adding and removing options from this point forward will not trigger the validation.      I've created a Fiddle of my code:  JSFiddle     Any help would be greatly appreciated - I know I'm close, but unfortunately my JQuery/JS skills aren't advanced enough to see the problem here.    HTML Markup (Please note I'm using Bootstrap 1.4.0)         });    UPDATE: I added some CSS to the Fiddle to better see the validation states, and more importantly, when it fails to validate after removing an option from the select.
