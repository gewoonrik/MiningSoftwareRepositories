Bootstrap Modal won't display  I am having trouble getting a modal to display.  I am using   3.0.3.  When I click the button, the screen goes grey but doesn't popup the modal.  The css and js files are in the same directory as the html file.  I know this code works because I copy and pasted it from     file=activate-modals-via-javascript .  So this makes me think that something is wrong with the way I declared my css and js files in the head.  Any help would be much appreciated!
