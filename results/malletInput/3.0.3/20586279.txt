  modal won't display  i am having trouble getting a modal to display.  i am using   3.0.3.  when i click the button, the screen goes grey but doesn't popup the modal.  the css and js files are in the same directory as the html file.  i know this code works because i copy and pasted it from     file=activate-modals-via-javascript .  so this makes me think that something is wrong with the way i declared my css and js files in the head.  any help would be much appreciated!
