jquery popover on calculations?  i ran into a problem with my jquery. i have been doing a calculator for certain items and quantity and originally made a popup  .alert  above the name and moved the whole row of items below it. to fix this problem i want to have a     v3.0.3 popover triggered by the live calculation of the number of items times the price of one item.     what i want to do:       //stone  $("#stone").on('keyup',function(){    // alert('pressed')    var coststone= $("#stoneprice").val() * $(this).val()    var coststone2 = coststone.tofixed(2);    $(".coststone").html(" data-toggle='popover' ");  });  //end stone      i know this won't work, but somehow i need someone to come up with a jquery alternative for   data-toggle  so that i can trigger the popover while typing in an input box.    if you want to see my original idea just to get an idea of what i'm talking aboutcheck out this  fiddle .
