Bootstrap 3 Form Wizard  Hi I am having problem with the form wizard I am using for   3.0.3    It's actually working but the next and previous buttons are not but when I click on the navigation it's working.    I don't know if the versions are compatible I downloaded this plugin       -wizard     But it says on the documentation is it compatible with 3.0.3    Any suggestions that is working for the   3.0.3 form wizard?    Thank you. Your comments are high appreciated :)         this is my html code
