push pull product page  good morning, today's goal is creating a responsive ecommerce "detail" page with   framework (v 3.0.3).    this is what we managed to do til now:     mobile version           desktop version          my code, omitting the standard template:         i need the prezzi; aggiungi; dettagli divs to be aligned below titolo: the line shouldn't be wrapped.     i mean titolo+prezzi+aggiungi+dettagli should be a sidebar in desktop version while keeping the push/pull titolo/img behavior.    can i do that using   pure grid logic or am i forced to fix it with some css custom media query tricks?    thx
