Push pull product page  Good morning, today's goal is creating a responsive ecommerce "detail" page with Bootstrap framework (v 3.0.3).    This is what we managed to do til now:     MOBILE VERSION           DESKTOP VERSION          My code, omitting the standard template:         I need the PREZZI; AGGIUNGI; DETTAGLI divs to be aligned below TITOLO: the line shouldn't be wrapped.     I mean TITOLO+PREZZI+AGGIUNGI+DETTAGLI should be a sidebar in desktop version while keeping the push/pull TITOLO/IMG behavior.    Can I do that using Bootstrap pure grid logic or am I forced to fix it with some CSS custom media query tricks?    Thx
