how to only apply certain rules to its text content and not its children  in short, i have something like this:      span class="classname"      text text text  button type="button" class="btn btn-default" button /button   /span   .classname {     font-style: italic;     /* more */ }      i only wanted the "text text text" to be italic, and  it works when i was using   3.0.3 . however, when i  updated to   3.2.0 , those rules are now also applying to the  button  in the  span . that is not the behavior i wanted.    i am wondering if wrapping the text in another  span  is the only way to fix it. it would make the html even more complicated and i don't really want to do that. i can also explicitly override the  italic  rule:     .classname   button {     font-style: normal;     /* more */ }      i don't think this code can be easily maintainable in the future thus i am not considering this one.    is there any other way that only applies those rules only to the text content but not the button? thanks.
