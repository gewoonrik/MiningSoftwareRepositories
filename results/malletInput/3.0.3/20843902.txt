rails:   stopped working after a precompile  for some reason my   broke after i precompiled my code. this started because i couldn't push to heroku because of a precompile error.    so here are the contents of my  application.js  file:     //= require jquery //= require jquery_ujs //= require jquery-ui //= require datatables/jquery.datatables //= require datatables/jquery.datatables. 3 //= require   //= require  /dropdown //= require_tree .      maybe the order is wrong? i just added  .../dropdown  hoping it would help, but it did not. i just realized i can actually remove both   lines without affecting my resulting site.    for my gems, i have:     gem ' -sass', "~ 3.0.3.0" ... gem ' -will_paginate', '0.0.6'      here is a link to my other question, which is similar but less focused:  ruby on rails: ran rake assets:precompile and now both local and heroku deployment don&#39;t include       any help would be greatly appreciated. i'm getting pretty frustrated, it's been several days of failed action.
