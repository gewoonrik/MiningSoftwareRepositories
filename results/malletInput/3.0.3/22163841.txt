Bootstrap Div inside dd, alignment issue  I am trying to align  div  tag inside  dd  tag. but the  div  is getting on the new line.  I have to use  div  for using it as javascript selector.    HTML                In above example the  Div  tag having  id  uploaders and  Div  tag having  id  downloaders are getting on the new line. how can i get then on the same line as of  dd  and icons.
