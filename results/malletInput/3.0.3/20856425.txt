Bootstrap 3.0.3 navbar-right and pull-right  I'm working through some Bootstrap tutorials and am using the Bootstrap 3.0.3 version.    I've noticed   did.    I have placed an example on  JSFiddle .    According to their  blog  on 5 Dec 2013, some modifications have been made, so am wondering if I have either structured the HTML classes incorrectly, or if this is the new approach to menu alignment?
