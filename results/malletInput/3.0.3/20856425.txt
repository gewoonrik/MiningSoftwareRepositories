  3.0.3 navbar-right and pull-right  i'm working through some   tutorials and am using the   3.0.3 version.    i've noticed   did.    i have placed an example on  jsfiddle .    according to their  blog  on 5 dec 2013, some modifications have been made, so am wondering if i have either structured the html classes incorrectly, or if this is the new approach to menu alignment?
