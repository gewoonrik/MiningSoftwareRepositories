  3 grid layout dynamically generated columns don't clear right  i'm trying to generate a   (v3.0.3) grid layout. data is dynamically generated with following code:      div class="row"      @foreach (var node in model.tour.nodes)     {          div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12"               div class="thumbnail"                  @node.somedata              /div           /div      }  /div       unfortunately, sometimes columns don't clear right as one is taller than the other, and i get something like this:         i know that there is a way to fix that by adding clearfix class where the new row should start:      div class="clearfix visible-xx"  /div       but i can't really do it when content is dynamically generated.    are there any solutions for such problems, or maybe my approach is wrong as i'm new to  .
