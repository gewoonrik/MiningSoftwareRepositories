ng-submit from   popover  the following jade template displays a login form (loginform) in a popover.  the same form markup when instead rendered as a part of a view in a route works fine, but when placed into the popover as coded below, the ng-submit doesn't work.  the submission of the form produces a get submission on the current location.         i'm assuming the form is falling out of scope.  what can be done?
