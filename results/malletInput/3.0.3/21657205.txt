ng-submit from   popover  The following jade template displays a login form (loginForm) in a popover.  The same form markup when instead rendered as a part of a view in a route works fine, but when placed into the popover as coded below, the ng-submit doesn't work.  The submission of the form produces a GET submission on the current location.         I'm assuming the form is falling out of scope.  What can be done?
