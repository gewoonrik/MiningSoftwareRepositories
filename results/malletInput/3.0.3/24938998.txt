how to compile older  3?  i want to build custom  3. i visited official website and went here:    .com/customize/     the problem is that this application allows only to build the current (3.2) version, but i want to build 3.0.3 (latest that works properly on my website).    i just want to set gutter width to 0px. is it possible to build older release?
