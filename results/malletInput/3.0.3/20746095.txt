using dart and    i'm experimenting with dart and am now trying to use     for its css framework. when i download the latest version of   (currently 3.0.3), it has the following file structure:     ├── css │   ├──  .css │   ├──  .min.css │   ├──  -theme.css │   └──  -theme.min.css ├── fonts │   ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot │   ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg │   ├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf │   └── glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff └── js     ├──  .js     └──  .min.js       (1) where do i put all these files, and how do i access them from inside both my dart source and html files?  for example, say i want to dynamically change the dom from inside a dart file, and add a   class to an element - what would this look like? and if i just wanted to give an html element a   class (inside a .html file), what would this look like?    i  assume  i might need a dart project with a package structure  something  like this:     mydartapp/     web/         myapp.dart     asset/          /             css/                  .css                  .min.css                  -theme.css                  -them.min.css             fonts/                 glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot                 glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg                 glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf                 glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff             js/                  .js                  .min.js      but having such little experience with both dart and  , not sure if i am missing anything big. obviously, i need to package the   files in such a way that the  asset/  urls in my dart/html files can access them before/after running  pub build ...     (2) also, can i just use the  min -version of each css/js file (  .min.js  instead of   .js , etc.)?     thanks in advance!
