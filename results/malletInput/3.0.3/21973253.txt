angular   accordion menu not displaying on mean stack boilerplate app?  i am using a fresh download of the mean stack boilerplate app from   and trying to implement a simple accordion menu, using the information found at    /#/accordion .    i popped the code below straight into public/views/index.html but the only thing that is displayed in my browser when i open the app is the checkbox with the text "open only one at a time."  however, when i take the same code a put it into a plunker or a jsfiddle, or even just a standalone html file, everything is displayed and it works perfectly.    this leads me to believe that there is some conflicting code included somewhere in the mean boilerplate app that is causing everything with an  tag to be hidden, but i can't even begin to imagine what it would be.  i believe i've installed all the dependencies and libraries using npm and bower.  please point me in the right direction!      !doctype html   html ng-app="plunker"     head       script src=" "  /script       script src="  /ui- -tpls-0.10.0.js"  /script       script src="example.js"  /script       link href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.3/css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet"        script type="text/javascript"        angular.module('plunker', ['ui. ']); function accordiondemoctrl($scope) {   $scope.oneatatime = true;    $scope.groups = [     {       title: "dynamic group header - 1",       content: "dynamic group body - 1"     },     {       title: "dynamic group header - 2",       content: "dynamic group body - 2"     }   ];    $scope.items = ['item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3'];    $scope.additem = function() {     var newitemno = $scope.items.length + 1;     $scope.items.push('item ' + newitemno);   }; }      /script     /head     body    div ng-controller="accordiondemoctrl"     label class="checkbox"       input type="checkbox" ng-model="oneatatime"      open only one at a time    /label      accordion close-others="oneatatime"       accordion-group heading="static header, initially expanded" is-open="true"        this content is straight in the template.      /accordion-group       accordion-group heading="{{group.title}}" ng-repeat="group in groups"        {{group.content}}      /accordion-group       accordion-group heading="dynamic body content"         p the body of the accordion group grows to fit the contents /p           button class="btn btn-default btn-sm" ng-click="additem()" add item /button           div ng-repeat="item in items" {{item}} /div       /accordion-group       accordion-group is-open="isopen"           accordion-heading              i can have markup, too!  i class="pull-right glyphicon" ng-class="{'glyphicon-chevron-down': isopen, 'glyphicon-chevron-right': !isopen}"  /i           /accordion-heading          this is just some content to illustrate fancy headings.      /accordion-group     /accordion   /div     /body   /html
