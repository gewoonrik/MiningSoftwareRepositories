Angular   accordion menu not displaying on MEAN stack boilerplate app?  I am using a fresh download of the MEAN stack boilerplate app from   and trying to implement a simple accordion menu, using the information found at    /#/accordion .    I popped the code below straight into public/views/index.html but the only thing that is displayed in my browser when I open the app is the checkbox with the text "Open only one at a time."  However, when I take the same code a put it into a plunker or a jsfiddle, or even just a standalone html file, everything is displayed and it works perfectly.    This leads me to believe that there is some conflicting code included somewhere in the MEAN boilerplate app that is causing everything with an  tag to be hidden, but I can't even begin to imagine what it would be.  I believe I've installed all the dependencies and libraries using npm and bower.  Please point me in the right direction!
