Bootstrap CDN not working with angular  I am trying to make a small app in angular and am trying to include the Bootstrap CDN into the head section.  My current head section looks like this:         When I go to refresh the page none of the   changed have been made.  Is this something going on with Angular or am I just making a dumb mistake?
