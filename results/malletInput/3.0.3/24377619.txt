ruby on rails showing landing page differently from localhost and html file  I'm implementing a landing page for a website I'm working on and found a great template online. I loaded everything up and correctly set the file links and everything. When I go into my views folder and double click the html file, it loads and looks great with all of the css and js working perfectly. The problem is that whenever I start the brick server and run it from local host as my actual landing page it's all skewed and oddly proportioned.    Most of the files loaded are from external sources, aka loaded from online vs locally, and the only two files loaded locally are referenced directly. Below is my code taken directly from my file.    Here is the landing page I am trying to implement.     .com/grayscale .    Here is my code                 So, my question is about what I am doing wrong. Is it a problem with running  ? Are there conflicting files? Why does it load differently using server vs just the file? I am completely baffled, but believe it has to be something simple.    If you need the files I am running, they are all in the link as a download from the   site.
