Popover en Modal of Bootstrap 3.0.3  I have a form in a Modal and when I do click in "Send" this must show a popover with the word "Thanks you", but When I click the first time, the popover is not displayed, but from the second time onwards and shows good.    My code is here          jsfiddle :          Something I'm doing wrong, because the popover should show from the first time that I do click Thanks
