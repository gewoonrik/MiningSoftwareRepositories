jQuery isotope v2 and   3 with different item sizes  im using jQuery 1.10.2 with Bootstrap 3.0.3 (   .com/ ) and Isotope v2 (   ).    I have 4 different item-sizes (col-xs-12, col-xs-6, col-xs-4, col-xs-3), these columns are mixed and defined by the user who manage the content - i can't control the order of this items. No my problem is, that isotope is using the first item-size as an reference.    This runs in an error, if the first item is "col-xs-6" and the second is smaller, than the layout is broken.    Does anybody know who to fix this issue?    best regards  CH
