  3 navbar-fixed-top gets a top white margin when navbar is collapsed  i am building a webapp using the latest   (3.0.3). i created the navbar by copy pasting from bootstap docs, like this:          i am testing this on a mobile phone, and on a nexus 7 tablet. whenever i collapse my navbar i get a white margin on top of the navigation bar. if i close the menu, the white margin disappears.     i also noticed that if i put enough links in my navigation menu such that i need to scroll to the bottom of the navigation, the white line margin also disappears.     the problem is that my navigation only has 2 links and when i collapse it on my tablet i always get the top margin. it is very frustrating. i only see this behavior on my tablet. on the phone and pc browsers it works fine. i do not know what is wrong. please help.
