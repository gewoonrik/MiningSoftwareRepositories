  3 navbar-fixed-top gets a top white margin when navbar is collapsed  I am building a webapp using the latest   (3.0.3). I created the navbar by copy pasting from bootstap docs, like this:          I am testing this on a mobile phone, and on a Nexus 7 tablet. Whenever I collapse my navbar I get a white margin on top of the navigation bar. If I close the menu, the white margin disappears.     I also noticed that If I put enough links in my navigation menu such that I need to scroll to the bottom of the navigation, the white line margin also disappears.     The problem is that my navigation only has 2 links and when I collapse it on my tablet I always get the top margin. It is very frustrating. I only see this behavior on my tablet. on the phone and pc browsers it works fine. I do not know what is wrong. Please help.
