how to easily apply   to a completed asp.net mvc 4 application?  i created an asp.net mvc 4 app. now i decided to integrate   3.0.3 in my app. but i found out it's not easy. i searched on google and found tutorials where they explain how to integrate   with a totally new asp.net mvc app.     tutorial 1      tutorial 2     my asp.net mvc 4 app has 'razor' as view engine and i selected the 'internet application' template.     do i have to modify all the views step-by-step because i didn't chose   at the beginning?    if i only include the  .css and  .js the pages become deformed.
