How to easily apply Bootstrap to a completed ASP.net MVC 4 application?  I created an ASP.net MVC 4 app. Now I decided to integrate   3.0.3 in my app. But I found out it's not easy. I searched on google and found tutorials where they explain how to integrate   with a totally new ASP.net MVC app.     Tutorial 1      Tutorial 2     My ASP.net MVC 4 app has 'Razor' as View engine and I selected the 'Internet Application' template.     Do I have to modify all the views step-by-step because I didn't chose Bootstrap at the beginning?    If I only include the  .css and  .js the pages become deformed.
