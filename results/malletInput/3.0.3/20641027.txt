compiling   3 in a symfony 2 project on windows  i have been trying for some time now to compile   3 in a symfony 2 project on windows. but i can't get it to work. my primary objective is to compile my very own less file. i called it "styles.less". in there, i want to be able to use   mixins like "make-xs-column" for example. so i need to import  .less for that.    here is what i did so far:    in my composer.json, i added the   bundle:         i tried to create my own recess filter to use that instead of less (based on the work by boteeka  found here ). but that didn't work either. the less files never compile. even an empty one, or a simple one.    could someone please point me in the right direction? is it possible on windows, to compile   3 in a symfony 2 project? if so, can someone give me the exact steps i should follow?
