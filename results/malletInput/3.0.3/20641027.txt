compiling   3 in a symfony 2 project on windows  i have been trying for some time now to compile   3 in a symfony 2 project on windows. but i can't get it to work. my primary objective is to compile my very own less file. i called it "styles.less". in there, i want to be able to use   mixins like "make-xs-column" for example. so i need to import  .less for that.    here is what i did so far:    in my composer.json, i added the   bundle:     {     ...      "require": {         ...         " / ": "v3.0.3"     },     .... }      since i want to use   3, i cannot use the lessphp filter, so i use the less filter instead. for that, i had to install nodejs, and then less (by running the command " npm install less -g "). finally, i modified my config.yml like so:     assetic:     debug:          "%kernel.debug%"     use_controller: false     bundles:        [ joepersonalwebsitebundle ]     filters:         cssrewrite: ~         less:             node: "c:\\dev\\nodejs\\lessc.cmd"             node_paths:                  - "c:\\dev\\nodejs\\node_modules"             apply_to: "\.less$"      now, in my layout.html.twig, i added the following:     {% stylesheets filter='less' '@joepersonalwebsitebundle/resources/less/styles.less' %}      link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ asset_url }}"  {% endstylesheets %}          and in my "styles.less" file, i import" .less" like so:     @import '../../../../../../vendor/ / /less/ .less';      but i always get an error. in fact, even if my "styles.less" file is completely empty, i always get an error like this one:     [exception] 500 | internal server error | assetic\exception\filterexception [message] an error occurred while running:  quot;c:\dev\nodejs\lessc.cmd quot;  quot;c:\users\joe\appdata\local\temp\assde7e.tmp quot;  error output: [31mparseerror: missing opening `{`[39m[31m in [39mc:\users\joe\appdata\local\temp\assde7e.tmp[90m on line 17, column 1:[39m [90m16 });[39m 17 [0m[0m   [1] assetic\exception\filterexception: an error occurred while running:  quot;c:\dev\nodejs\lessc.cmd quot;  quot;c:\users\joe\appdata\local\temp\assde7e.tmp quot;  error output: [31mparseerror: missing opening `{`[39m[31m in [39mc:\users\joe\appdata\local\temp\assde7e.tmp[90m on line 17, column 1:[39m [90m16 });[39m 17 [0m[0m      i tried to create my own recess filter to use that instead of less (based on the work by boteeka  found here ). but that didn't work either. the less files never compile. even an empty one, or a simple one.    could someone please point me in the right direction? is it possible on windows, to compile   3 in a symfony 2 project? if so, can someone give me the exact steps i should follow?
