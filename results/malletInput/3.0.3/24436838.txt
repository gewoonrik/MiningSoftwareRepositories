rails form helper number_field_tag size option not working in rails 4?  i'm using rails 4.1.1, ruby 2.1.2,     (  sass gem) 3.0.3.  number_field_tag  shows the same size no matter what i set the  size  option to per the documentation saying that it can take the same options as  text_field_tag  (which has a  size  option).    incidentally, just to test, i tried a  text_field_tag  and the  size  option works fine. anyone know the fix here? i'm happy to use a css class to achieve the same effect, but why write extra code right?    also note, when i inspect element,  size  is showing up, it's just not doing anything:      input id="transaction__portable_table" min="0" name="transaction[][portable table]" size="1" type="number" value="0"
