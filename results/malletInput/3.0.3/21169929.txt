  tab shows but does not highlight until clicked  i am using     (v3.0.3) tabs, and they are working perfectly except... the tab that i have marked as  active  does not visually highlight unless you click on it.    the interesting thing is i can reproduce this behavior using jsfiddle and the example code from the     website:       example:    .com/javascript/#tabs   jsfiddle:         example tab code:       !-- nav tabs --   ul class="nav nav-tabs"     li  a href="#home" data-toggle="tab" home /a  /li     li  a href="#profile" data-toggle="tab" profile /a  /li     li  a href="#messages" data-toggle="tab" messages /a  /li     li  a href="#settings" data-toggle="tab" settings /a  /li   /ul    !-- tab panes --   div class="tab-content"     div class="tab-pane active" id="home" ... /div     div class="tab-pane" id="profile" ... /div     div class="tab-pane" id="messages" ... /div     div class="tab-pane" id="settings" ... /div   /div       note in jsfiddle that the  active  tab is open but not visually highlighted.  if you move the  active  css class to a different tab, and set some kind of content so you can tell them apart, you'll see that   is reading that class and opening the correct  tab by default, it's just not highlighting it...  if you click on any tab, including the currently active one, the visual cue shows up highlighting the tab.
