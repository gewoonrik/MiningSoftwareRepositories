Bootstrap Tab shows but does not highlight until clicked  I am using Twitter Bootstrap (v3.0.3) Tabs, and they are working perfectly except... the tab that I have marked as   css class to a different tab, and set some kind of content so you can tell them apart, you'll see that Bootstrap is reading that class and opening the correct  tab by default, it's just not highlighting it...  If you click on any tab, including the currently active one, the visual cue shows up highlighting the tab.
