bootsrap "zebra-striped" table class doesn't work  just downloaded   from getboostrap.com ( direct link ), then correctly included   .min.css,  -theme.min.css and  .min.js into my document.    i styled my forms successfully, now i want to add the "zebra-striped" class to my tables. but nothing happens, the tr and td elements in the table don't get the class applied to them. i searched "zebra-striped" in the 3 files (2 css and 1 js), it's not there.    version problem? or should i install some   add-on?
