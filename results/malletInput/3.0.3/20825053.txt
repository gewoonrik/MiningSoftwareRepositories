Bootsrap "zebra-striped" table class doesn't work  Just downloaded Bootstrap from getboostrap.com ( direct link ), then correctly included   .min.css,  -theme.min.css and  .min.js into my document.    I styled my forms successfully, now I want to add the "zebra-striped" class to my tables. But nothing happens, the TR and TD elements in the table don't get the class applied to them. I searched "zebra-striped" in the 3 files (2 CSS and 1 JS), it's not there.    Version problem? Or should I install some Bootstrap add-on?
