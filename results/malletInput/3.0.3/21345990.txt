Unable to center website brand in navbar?  I am trying to center my website's brand in the navbar using   3.0 and have been unsuccessful in doing so. I have tried both of these solutions:  twitter   -- center brand in nav bar   Bootstrap: center some navbar items  And neither has worked for me. Here is my current code:         I have tried text-align: center and auto margins and nothing has worked. Any ideas? EDIT: JSFiddle:
