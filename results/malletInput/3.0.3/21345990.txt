unable to center website brand in navbar?  i am trying to center my website's brand in the navbar using   3.0 and have been unsuccessful in doing so. i have tried both of these solutions:      -- center brand in nav bar    : center some navbar items  and neither has worked for me. here is my current code:      link rel="stylesheet" href="  cdn.com/ /3.0.3/css/ .min.css"   div class="navbar navbar-default navbar-fixed-top" role="navigation"     div class="container"       div class="navbar-header"         a class="navbar-brand" href="index.php" my website's brand /a       /div     /div   /div   script src=" "  /script   script type="text/javascript" src="  cdn.com/ /3.0.3/js/ .min.js"  /script       i have tried text-align: center and auto margins and nothing has worked. any ideas? edit: jsfiddle:
