Chrome Only Bootstrap + Google Maps Bug  Let me first say that the map is drawing correctly, this is not a duplicate of the other maps/  bug.    I am having an issue where a map on a twitter   modal is causing the modal to be clipped visually.          This appears to be a Chrome only bug as it does not happen on Firefox or Safari.    I am using: google maps api v3   twiter   3.0.3     The Html          The map displays with no problems but the rest of the modal is gone. This does not happen for any other modals on the website (viewing pictures and such).There is no extra css or styling. The modal and all elements are placed correctly and all z-indexes appear correct. The input box and button are still functional they are just not drawing correctly.
