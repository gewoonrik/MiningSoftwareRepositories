  typeahead with   (and without) not working  i am trying to get a basic   typeahead tooltip showing. i've followed the docs but nothing is showing up.no errors are thrown in console either.    i am using   3.0.3. typeahead is supposed to be built in to it. however, i get a  uncaught typeerror: object [object object] has no method 'typeahead'  error if i do not import it directly.    the way i am doing it is as follows:      input name="hostname_search" id="typeahead" autocomplete="off" size=100 /       and for the js:      $('#typeahead').typeahead(    {      local: [{ val: 'dog' }, { val: 'pig' }, { val: 'moose' }]    }  );       's docs says we should  source  instead of  local  and in the html, use  data-provide . i am using the above as that's what typeahead's actual docs show, outside of  .    any idea what i'm missing/what i need to do to get it showing? also, why isn't it using typeahead in  ?
