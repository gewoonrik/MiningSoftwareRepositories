chrome refuses to print with   2.3.2  i have been scouring the internet for this one, i have a project at work that uses   2.3.2 for styling. all is good but when we try and print the page. chrome and only chrome refuses to print with the boot strap styles.    just for fun i have tried the new   3.0.3 css files and they won't print properly in chrome either.    has anyone encountered an issue where it prints or gives a proper print preview in ie and firefox but not in chrome when it comes to  ?
