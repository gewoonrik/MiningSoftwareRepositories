angular ui datepicker popup with type-in returns one date earlier than typed in protractor  this is a bit complicated, but i've now verified it with both angular scenario tester and protractor, and in the user interface.      set up     3.x (i'm using the latest but had 3.0.3 before) - from the bower boostrap install   set up angular ui with the built-in templates (i'm using the angular-ui- -bower library from bower)    set up a datepicker-popup field in angular-ui like this:      label for='due_date' due date /label   input id='due_date'        class='form-control'        type='text'        datepicker-options="dateoptions"        datepicker-popup='yyyy-mm-dd'        ng-model="task.duedate"        add a button and a controller method to inspect the variable.       testing:       click on the date field, and type in a date:  2013-01-05   hit escape or click on another field to close the popup dialog (i.e. don't click done)   submit the form      you'll find the date to be one day behind.    interestingly, if you click on an actual date in the date picker, it will be correct. including 'today'.  if i remove the ui datepicker, it works fine with persisting the typed-in data. my date format is yyyy-mm-dd when i type it in.    this is maddening, as i've thought it was a bug in angular scenario, but once i figured out that protractor also fails, and that i could reproduce it by canceling the dialog, and even typing and submitting, i am beginning to think it has something to do with localization and timezones.    anyone else run into this?     here is a protractor test that fails:       it('should return one task', function () {     thepage.cleartasksbutton.click();     thepage.newtaskbutton.click();     thepage.taskdescription.clear();     thepage.taskdescription.sendkeys('a new task');      thepage.taskpriority.clear();     thepage.taskpriority.sendkeys('1');      thepage.duedate.clear();     // pick today and dismiss the angular datepicker     thepage.todaybutton.click();      thepage.createtaskbutton.click();      var task = element.all(by.repeater('task in tasks').row(0).column('duedate'));      task.then(function(elems) {       // should result in one row       expect(elems.length).toequal(1);  // this works       expect(elems[0].gettext()).toequal('2014-03-19'); // this is 2014-03-18     });     ...      thanks    ken
