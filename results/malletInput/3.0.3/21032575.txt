putting a dropdown panel in the navbar   3.0.3  i'm trying to put a panel with a few form elements and a dropdown category selection into a collapsible navbar in  . currently i have             i stopped event propagation on the panel, and the radio buttons work great, but whenever i click the "personal" button to select from categories, the panel shuts. i'm sure it has something to do with having the data target of the parent dropdown, but i'm not sure how to fix that.
