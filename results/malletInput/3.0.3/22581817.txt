Angularjs datepicker popup  -ui does not work in view  I am an angularjs and   ui newbie! My date picker popup is not working in my included view. It works if its outside the view.  i.e. as demoed here Any assistance will be appreciated. But, because I am using the ngRoute approach, I need to compose my view in the partial html and include in the main index.html. The inline calendar does not show and the popup calendar does not show as well. I cannot figure out the problem, but I think the date-picker.html cannot reference the script and style in my index.html. I have other included pane in the date-picker hmtl which references the scripts and css in the index.html fine.  Any assistance will be appreciated. Below is the code:       **index.html* *
