storing php variable from html text input field  i've been bashing my head against a desk for awhile over this one and my brain is mush from reading tons of stuff and not having anything work.    basically, i need to take the input from an html input field, assign it to a php variable, then append that variable to the end of a url.  i'm not having much luck at all so far!
