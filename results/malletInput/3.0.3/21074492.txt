less compiler gets stuck when mixins are declared multiple times  i want to join multiple   based addons/themes into one vendor.css:      everything works fine, otherwise the compiler (grunt-contrib-less v0.9.0) gets stuck.     since i use bower for package management, it's not an option for me to modify any vendor files. do i have any other chance to get this to work than compiling every vendor on its own?
