less compiler gets stuck when mixins are declared multiple times  i want to join multiple   based addons/themes into one vendor.css:     //     v3.0.3 @import "vendor/ /less/ .less";  // jasny   v3.0.1-p7 @import "vendor/ -jasny/less/jasny- .less";      both files include a mixins.less with a different file path. as soon as i delete  @import "mixins.less";  in  jasny- .less  everything works fine, otherwise the compiler (grunt-contrib-less v0.9.0) gets stuck.     since i use bower for package management, it's not an option for me to modify any vendor files. do i have any other chance to get this to work than compiling every vendor on its own?
