Less compiler gets stuck when mixins are declared multiple times  I want to join multiple   based addons/themes into one vendor.css:      everything works fine, otherwise the compiler (grunt-contrib-less v0.9.0) gets stuck.     Since I use bower for package management, it's not an option for me to modify any vendor files. Do I have any other chance to get this to work than compiling every vendor on its own?
