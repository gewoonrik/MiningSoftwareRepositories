adding     to a gae java maven project  i want to add     (v3.0.3 as of now) to a (very early stage)  gae  java project which is already using maven.    am looking for recommendations for the best/cleanest way to do this.    so far i've found  webjars  and  efsavage/ -maven . webjars seems to the cleaner of the two plus more generally applicable. also, efsavage require servlets 3.0, which gae doesn't support yet.    any reason to choose one over the other? any other solutions i should be looking at?    not using any framework, so framework-specific examples won't work for me.
