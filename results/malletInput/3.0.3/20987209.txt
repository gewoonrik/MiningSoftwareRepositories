Bootstrap Popover Change Quantity  I have a list view of cart items. I want to allow the user to increment/decrement quantity on hover or click for each item inside a popover. I have written the below code but popover hides when I try clicking inside the + or - sign inside the popover. Any help in this regards and also, pointers to customizing the CSS, making it generic without hardcoding would be highly appreciated and helpful. Using  -3.0.3 and jquery-1.9.1
