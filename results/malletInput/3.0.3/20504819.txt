How to draw onto a responsive website  I m trying to create what I hope will be a basic responsive website using Bootstrap 3.0.3.  I am making a time line, that goes down vertically, when the window is large It has icons on either side of the timeline, otherwise the icons line up and the timeline markers shrink. Like this: When Large:       When Small:         Currently the Icons and words behave properly, but I had to draw the lines in to illustrate my point. In reality I have | and - representing the lines, and they appear and disappear with resizing. My question is this, how can I draw the actual lines of the timeline so they act properly. Is there some vector or shape drawing I can do within the grid elements or do I just have to draw the lines elsewhere and bring it in as a background image and change that with window resize?    Current Code:
