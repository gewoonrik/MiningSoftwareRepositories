Scrollbar appears when centering vertically and horizontally, can't get rid of it  Using Bootstrap 3.0.3, I'm attempting to center both horizontally and vertically a div with a hard-coded width and height. The JSFiddle has the latest code in it, also reported here to be consistent with SO's rules regarding JSFiddle.           The HTML:      div.    I'd love a pointer on two on how to make this specific layout happen correctly, as I suspect I'm doing this the hard way.
