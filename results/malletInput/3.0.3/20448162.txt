scrollbar appears when centering vertically and horizontally, can't get rid of it  using   3.0.3, i'm attempting to center both horizontally and vertically a div with a hard-coded width and height. the jsfiddle has the latest code in it, also reported here to be consistent with so's rules regarding jsfiddle.           the html:      div.    i'd love a pointer on two on how to make this specific layout happen correctly, as i suspect i'm doing this the hard way.
