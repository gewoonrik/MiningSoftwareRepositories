scrollbar appears when centering vertically and horizontally, can't get rid of it  using   3.0.3, i'm attempting to center both horizontally and vertically a div with a hard-coded width and height. the jsfiddle has the latest code in it, also reported here to be consistent with so's rules regarding jsfiddle.           the html:      div class="text-center full-height"       div class="inline full-height"           div class="fake-table full-height"               div class="fake-table-cell full-height"                   div class="content fake-table"                       div class="fake-table-cell" foobar /div                   /div               /div           /div       /div   /div       the css:      html, body {     height: 100%; }  .fake-table {     display: table; } .fake-table-cell {     display: table-cell;     vertical-align: middle; } .inline {     display: inline-block; } .text-center {     text-align: center; } .full-height {     height: 100%; } .content {     background-color: grey;     width: 300px;     height: 150px; }      what i'm showing in the jsfiddle appears to "work", however for some reason  it adds a vertical scrollbar . what's interesting is that changing the body's  font-size ,  font-family  and  line-height  appears to affect the scrollbar, and thus i imagine this has something to do with the  height: 100%  and the  inline-block  div.    i'd love a pointer on two on how to make this specific layout happen correctly, as i suspect i'm doing this the hard way.
