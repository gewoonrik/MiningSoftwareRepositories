    content in container not centered  i'm using     for a site. i'm trying to get the content centered. traditionally i would simple create a custom  .container  class that looks like this:     .container {   width: 70%;   max-width: 1024px;   margin: 0 auto; }      i've tried to override this class manually, but only the width seems to make a difference. i place the content inside the container like this:      div class="container     div ng-view  /div   /div           the container itself is centered. but the content inside seems to have a left margin/padding. any ideas on how i should structure my divs?       update   i use    v3.0.3
