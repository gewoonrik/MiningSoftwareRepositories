  unicode content not working when changing folder structure  i'm testing normal html page with   v.3 on my windows 2008 server. something i can't get happening while testing and changing my css folder structure where the css content unicode values  "carousel arrows"  don't work when i move   css/ .css   from the css folder to    themes/default/css/   ... for example with using using import inside my core css          i even made sure that i copy the working file in example to the second folder structure without open in any editor!    edit    a small hint, it worked under any second level folder e.g.  themes/ .css     edit (solved)    oh my god, i forgot to download the new  precompiled package    and upload the  glyphicons web-fonts  also for some reason the carousel arrows worked without it in the worked case.
