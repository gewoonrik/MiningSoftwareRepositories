Bootstrap Unicode content not working when changing folder structure  I'm testing normal HTML page with Bootstrap V.3 on my windows 2008 server. something I can't get happening while testing and changing my CSS folder structure where the CSS content Unicode values  "carousel arrows"  don't work when I move   css/ .css   from the CSS folder to    themes/default/css/   ... for example with using using import inside my core CSS          I even made sure that I copy the working file in example to the second folder structure without open in any editor!    Edit    A small hint, it worked under any second level folder e.g.  themes/ .css     EDIT (Solved)    Oh my God, I forgot to download the new  Precompiled package  Bootstrap and upload the  Glyphicons web-fonts  Also for some reason the carousel arrows worked without it in the worked case.
