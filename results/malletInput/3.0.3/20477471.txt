Bootstrap LightBox, image won't close consistently  I am trying to create a basic Lightbox example, using  Bootstrap LightBox  When I click on my thumbnail the new image shows up as it should, but for some reason I cannot consistently close it. I have to click around randomly, and only sometimes will the image close, but even if the image does close the shadow still remains. How can I fix this?    It may be worth noting that I have seen others ad a close button
