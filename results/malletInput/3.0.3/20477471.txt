  lightbox, image won't close consistently  i am trying to create a basic lightbox example, using    lightbox  when i click on my thumbnail the new image shows up as it should, but for some reason i cannot consistently close it. i have to click around randomly, and only sometimes will the image close, but even if the image does close the shadow still remains. how can i fix this?    it may be worth noting that i have seen others ad a close button       button type="button" class="close btn btn-small" data-dismiss="lightbox" aria-hidden="true" style='background-color:#ffffff;'  nbsp; times; nbsp; /button       with in their lightbox image, and this will seemingly close the image, but the shadow stays. i say seemingly because if i click and drag where the image use to be, i can still select it as if it were actually there.      !doctype html   html     head       title   101 template /title       meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"       script src=" "  /script       script src="  cdn.com/ /3.0.3/js/ .min.js"  /script       script src="  -lightbox/0.6.1/ -lightbox.js"  /script         link rel="stylesheet" href="  cdn.com/ /3.0.3/css/ .min.css"         link rel="stylesheet" href="  -lightbox/0.6.1/ -lightbox.css"     /head      body       a data-toggle="lightbox" href="#demolightbox"  img src="shell_small.jpg"  /a       div id="demolightbox" class="lightbox fade"  tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"           div class='lightbox-content'               img src="testudo_logo.jpg"               div class='lightbox-caption'                  your caption here              /div           /div       /div         /body   /html
