  lightbox, image won't close consistently  i am trying to create a basic lightbox example, using    lightbox  when i click on my thumbnail the new image shows up as it should, but for some reason i cannot consistently close it. i have to click around randomly, and only sometimes will the image close, but even if the image does close the shadow still remains. how can i fix this?    it may be worth noting that i have seen others ad a close button
