  bs-example  i copied css code for bs-example from the   3.0.3 docs site. i'm kind of a beginner with css, so if anyone could explain me this i would be thankful.     the following code:     /* echo out a label for the example */ .bs-example:after {   content: "example";   position: absolute;   top:  15px;   left: 15px;   font-size: 12px;   font-weight: bold;   color: #bbb;   text-transform: uppercase;   letter-spacing: 1px; }      it works as expected,          but i would like the title, example, can be changeable. i would like to use a tag like  let's say   zd  /zd  .    thanks in advance.
