anybody else have problems with   tables after updating to 3.1.1?  a couple of hours ago i upgraded from   3.0.3 to 3.1.1, and all of my tables have suddenly collapsed horizontally to minimum width.  earlier today this table displayed fine, taking up the full width of the .container object      div class="table-responsive"       table class="table table-striped table-condensed" id="intakes_header"           caption class="h2" annual intakes [1] /caption           thead style="height: auto;" id="intakes_head" class="intakes_targets in"               tr                   th school year /th                   th referred by /th                   th exit date /th                   th  nbsp; /th               /tr           /thead           tbody style="height: auto;" id="intakes_body" class="intakes_targets col-sm-12 in"               tr                   td 2013-14 /td                   td safe house /td                   td - /td                   td  a href=" " class="btn btn-default btn-sm" \=""  span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"  /span  /a  /td               /tr           /tbody       /table   /div       now the   caption   runs the full width, but the columns are the minimum size necessary to display the content, and the headers don't even align with the column content beneath them.  the really weird part is that i've been experimenting with adding col-md-x classes, and if i add a set that add up to 12 the columns display normally, but otherwise they remain squished, i.e.      tr       th class='col-sm-3' school year /th       th class='col-sm-3' referred by /th       th class='col-sm-3' exit date /th       th class='col-sm-2'  nbsp; /th   /tr       displays as squished together as it does without the classes, but      tr       th class='col-sm-3' school year /th       th class='col-sm-3' referred by /th       th class='col-sm-3' exit date /th       th class='col-sm-3'  nbsp; /th   /tr       spreads them out without a hitch.  this has affected every table i've looked at in my application since the upgrade.    obviously i should be able to make tables spread out by manually adding the column classes, but that also locks me into fixed proportions of width, which isn't always appropriate depending on what records are returned to fill the tables.  i'm just trying to figure out what happened here to (apparently) break the tables.  any suggestions on what to check?
