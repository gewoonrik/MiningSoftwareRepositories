Bootstrap 3.0.3 - Carousel images not rendering the same across browsers  I have a small Bootstrap-enabled demo that I'd like to show to a client, but the images in my jumbotron's carousel don't render the same from browser to browser.    It looks fine in chrome:         But there's a weird gap to the right in Firefox and IE.    Firefox:         IE:         My code is more or less lifted directly from the Bootstrap source itself, which is why this is so troubling:         I don't have any custom CSS relating to the carousel.  It's entirely controlled/defined by Bootstrap.    Any ideas?  I need to make this cross-browser friendly.
