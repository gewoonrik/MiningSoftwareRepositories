  3.0.3 - carousel images not rendering the same across browsers  i have a small  -enabled demo that i'd like to show to a client, but the images in my jumbotron's carousel don't render the same from browser to browser.    it looks fine in chrome:         but there's a weird gap to the right in firefox and ie.    firefox:         ie:         my code is more or less lifted directly from the   source itself, which is why this is so troubling:         i don't have any custom css relating to the carousel.  it's entirely controlled/defined by  .    any ideas?  i need to make this cross-browser friendly.
