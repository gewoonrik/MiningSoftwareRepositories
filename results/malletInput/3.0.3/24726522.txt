  3.0.3 - carousel images not rendering the same across browsers  i have a small  -enabled demo that i'd like to show to a client, but the images in my jumbotron's carousel don't render the same from browser to browser.    it looks fine in chrome:         but there's a weird gap to the right in firefox and ie.    firefox:         ie:         my code is more or less lifted directly from the   source itself, which is why this is so troubling:      div class="container"       h1 id="welcome" welcome to k9 sports center! /h1           div id="k9-carousel" class="carousel slide hidden-xs" data-ride="carousel"               ol class="carousel-indicators"                   li data-target="#k9-carousel" data-slide-to="0" class="active"  /li                   li data-target="#k9-carousel" data-slide-to="1"  /li                   li data-target="#k9-carousel" data-slide-to="2"  /li               /ol               div class="carousel-inner"                   div class="item active"                       img data-src="holder.js/900x350/auto/#777:#777" alt="first slide" /                       div class="carousel-caption"                           h3 we can put images of dogs and whatnot here /h3                           p along with captions to further describe or highlight certain things /p                       /div                   /div                   div class="item"                       img data-src="holder.js/900x350/auto/#666:#666" alt="second slide" /                       div class="carousel-caption"                           h3 we wouldn't want too many images, though /h3                           p too many = info overload.  need to leave them wanting more! /p                       /div                   /div                   div class="item"                       img data-src="holder.js/900x350/auto/#555:#555" alt="third slide" /                       div class="carousel-caption"                           h3 in my experience, 3-5 images is perfect /h3                           p it allows you to give an accurate account of things without suffocating the visitor /p                       /div                   /div               /div               a class="left carousel-control" href="#k9-carousel" data-slide="prev"                   span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"  /span               /a               a class="right carousel-control" href="#k9-carousel" data-slide="next"                   span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"  /span               /a           /div                        div class="k9content"               p new hampshire's premiere doggy daycare, training, grooming, and boarding facility! /p               p we offer the best for you and your pet, providing quality service with a fun sports theme! /p               p  a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="#" role="button" learn more /a  /p           /div       /div       i don't have any custom css relating to the carousel.  it's entirely controlled/defined by  .    any ideas?  i need to make this cross-browser friendly.
