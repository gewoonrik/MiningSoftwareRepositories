Incompatibility of Bootstrap3 with JPlayer Circle Player  I'm trying to get JPlayer's nice looking Circle Player:     to work with Bootstrap3.  It works with Bootstrap 2.3. There appears to be an incompatibility.  It sure would be great if anyone knows how to fix it, or could find it.  I think that this will probably affect others as well. I haven't been able to find a solution online.    Here are some details: 1. Circle player works correctly when   is not loaded. 2. Circle player works correctly when the following is included: //netdna. cdn.com/twitter- /2.3.2/css/ -combined.min.css 3. Circle player does not display properly when the following is included: //netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.3/css/ .min.css    Circle Player itself includes the following libraries:  jquery.transform2d.js, jquery.grab.js, mod.csstransforms.min.js, circle.player.js    Using the following Bootstrap 3 theme:    .com/theme/3-in-1-admin-front-end-e-commerce-WB0G69690
