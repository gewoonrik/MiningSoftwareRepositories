minimal angularui page functionality not working  i've got the following code:      !doctype html   !--[if lt ie 7]        html class="no-js lt-ie9 lt-ie8 lt-ie7"   ![endif]--   !--[if ie 7]           html class="no-js lt-ie9 lt-ie8"   ![endif]--   !--[if ie 8]           html class="no-js lt-ie9"   ![endif]--   !--[if gt ie 8]  !--   html class="no-js" ng-app="app"   !-- ![endif]--       head            script src=" "  /script           script src="/static/js/ui- -tpls-0.10.0.js"  /script               meta charset="utf-8"       meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge"       meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"            link href="  cdn.com/ /3.0.3/css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet"/           script              angular.module('app', ['ui. ']);          /script        /head       body           datepicker  /datepicker           timepicker  /timepicker        /body   /html       that currently renders this datepicker and timepicker:         at first, i thought it was a problem with my code, being part of a larger site, but after reducing the template to just the basics, i'm confused as to why this doesn't work. could anyone offer any insight as to why it's not working?
