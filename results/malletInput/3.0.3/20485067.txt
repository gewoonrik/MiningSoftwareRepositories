Bootstrap 3.0.3 highlight label does not work  For some reason everytime I try the label does not highlight blue like its supposed to as I saw in this video-        Neither do the buttons look the same, my clear is flat and so is my submit it's not round or bulging out like for i.e when you click sign in on Twitter. Also when I try to space the Label it doesn't space instead it sort of went down and theres no separate space. Can anyone please help me? I'm not sure what I am doing wrong.    I am on a PC btw if that changes anything..
