How do you make GCT compile not break a navbar?  Cannot really JSFiddle this, but this fiddle can give the idea:     GCT = Google Closure Tools         The result "works" as expected for compiled or uncompiled. The navbar still transforms on narrower screen, but it does not collapse to the single button. Rather, the links and drop downs (missing in the fiddle) come vertically left, as in the expanded mobile format. Not good as the navbar is hiding much of the available page. But at least this does not lose all functionality when clicked. (Only if closure-compiled.)    All that to say, the problem is most likely isolated to the button.
