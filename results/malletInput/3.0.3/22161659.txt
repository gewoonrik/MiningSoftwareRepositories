dropdown getting displayed under the caracole    with my nav's dropdowns it wont display correctly. somehow the drop-down will go under caracole. it's annoying and weird. i'm using bsv3.0.3 js and css match versions.  it's most notable when you look at the servers > hub link. you can't click it.  head to  fgkservers.com  and go to the secon slide. click servers in the nav and try going to the link hub. won't let you.          thanks for your help - fred
