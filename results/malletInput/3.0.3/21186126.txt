  3 - dropdown login form without caret and upper rounded borders  i downloaded   3.0.3 (clicked the "download  " button from the home page) and used this code to make a login form come from a dropdown.         i added these lines to a second css. of course they make the caron appear on the left hand side of the dropdown, but i'd like it to appear on the right. i assume there are probably a few more lines missing in my css (did the caron recently become obsolete for  ?).    i'd also like to correct the problem about top corners not appearing rounded.    thanks in advance for your help.    screenshot:
