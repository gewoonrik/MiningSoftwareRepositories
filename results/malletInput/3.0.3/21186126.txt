  3 - dropdown login form without caret and upper rounded borders  i downloaded   3.0.3 (clicked the "download  " button from the home page) and used this code to make a login form come from a dropdown.      div class="navbar-collapse collapse"       ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"           li class="dropdown"               a href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" id="register" data-toggle="dropdown" register  b class="caret"  /b  /a               div class="dropdown-menu" style="width: 400px"                   form id="register-form" class="navbar-form navbar-left"                       !--(form goes here)--                   /form               /div   !-- /dropdown-menu --           /li   !-- /dropdown --           !--(here goes another dropdown)--       /ul   /div  !-- /navbar-collapse --       rounded corners only show at the bottom and i couldn't manage to make the caron appear. after a while i checked here and found out that i had a few lines missing in my   css file - namely these lines:     .navbar .nav   li   .dropdown-menu::before {   position: absolute;   top: -7px;   left: 9px;   display: inline-block;   border-right: 7px solid transparent;   border-bottom: 7px solid #ccc;   border-left: 7px solid transparent;   border-bottom-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);   content: ''; }  .navbar .nav   li   .dropdown-menu::after {   position: absolute;   top: -6px;   left: 10px;   display: inline-block;   border-right: 6px solid transparent;   border-bottom: 6px solid white;   border-left: 6px solid transparent;   content: ''; }      i added these lines to a second css. of course they make the caron appear on the left hand side of the dropdown, but i'd like it to appear on the right. i assume there are probably a few more lines missing in my css (did the caron recently become obsolete for  ?).    i'd also like to correct the problem about top corners not appearing rounded.    thanks in advance for your help.    screenshot:
