how to create a fixed, vertical, expandabale navbar?  i already read the related questions, which unfortunately do not give an answer to my specific problem:    on the basis of   3.0.3, i am trying to create a fixed navbar on the left with a width of 50px, which should expand to a width of 150px, when you click on the navbar-toogle. when the navbar is not expanded, it should display only the glyphicons for each link. i am able to create the navbar with a fixed width, but i am stuck with the correct incorporation of the navbar-toggle and the the span-text, which is neither displaying nor working correctly. have a look at the example pictures for the intended result:               html:          i would appreciate your advice on this.
