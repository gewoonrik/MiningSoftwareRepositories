I already read the related questions, which unfortunately do not give an answer to my specific problem:    On the basis of Bootstrap 3.0.3, I am trying to create a fixed navbar on the left with a width of 50px, which should expand to a width of 150px, when you click on the navbar-toogle. When the navbar is not expanded, it should display only the glyphicons for each link.

Have a look at the example pictures for the intended result:               HTML:          I would appreciate your advice on this.
