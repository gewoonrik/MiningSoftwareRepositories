  tooltip doesn't appear, jquery scope?  after reading the   3 documentation, i also saw this post:    3 tooltips or popovers doesn&#39;t work     i am using the javascript like this:  $(".tip").tooltip();  but i don't know if it's in scope since the   styling isn't being applied.  i have the following in a loop since i am generating html dynamically:     htmlstr+=" td  a href='#' class='tip' data-toggle='tooltip' " +       "data-placement='right' title='" + finalexpr + "' " + expr +                " /a /td ";      that line is in a jquery each loop, which is in another each loop.  then i close the table, then i use the javascript like this:  $(".tip").tooltip() ;    i encountered a similar situaton before and it was because i put the selector listener in the wrong spot.  to my understanding, you always want to put it after the html has been generated.  i am placing this selector function call after generating the table and right before replacing the div html in my single page application(via jquery .html) so i don't see why it's not working.  i also have the following imports:      link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="css/main.css"   link rel="stylesheet" media="screen"        href="  cdn.com/ /3.0.3/css/ .min.css"    link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="css/ -theme.min.css"   link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/png" href="img/favicon.png"   link rel="stylesheet" href="  ui.css"   script src="js/jquery-1.9.0.min.js" type="text/javascript"  /script    script src=" "  /script     script src="  cdn.com/ /3.0.3/js/ .min.js"   type="text/javascript"  /script       thank you
