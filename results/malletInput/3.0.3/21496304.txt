Bootstrap collapse component not closing menu on clicking away  When I click away the menu doesn't hide, I found this code at:    .com/components/#navbar  but doesn't work as it should.         Yes, I got: proper libraries installed: Bootstrap v3.0.3. There are no javascript errors, and the HTML code is valid.    Steps to reproduce: Download the   3.0.3 zip package, make an index.html file, insert the css and js stuff for  . Enter the above code, and it's not closing when click or touched away.    So is the code meant to hide the menu or not ?
