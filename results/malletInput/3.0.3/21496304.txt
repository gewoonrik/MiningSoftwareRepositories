  collapse component not closing menu on clicking away  when i click away the menu doesn't hide, i found this code at:    .com/components/#navbar  but doesn't work as it should.         yes, i got: proper libraries installed:   v3.0.3. there are no javascript errors, and the html code is valid.    steps to reproduce: download the   3.0.3 zip package, make an index.html file, insert the css and js stuff for  . enter the above code, and it's not closing when click or touched away.    so is the code meant to hide the menu or not ?
