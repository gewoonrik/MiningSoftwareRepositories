are all img supposed to be 100% with basic   setup?  i'm creating a site using    3.0.3  and implemented the   carousel in the header.     i had been pounding away at the page for days which had appeared to be working properly without issue and then i noticed something unusual. all of the images on the page were at one point at a 100%.     i hadn't placed them on a grid and so that seemed to me to be normal/default behavior. now they are all displaying at their precise dimensions. this of course is affecting my hero/carousel images when my browser is fully expanded as they are now displaying with some grey space to the right, however, they do resize and fill the page as i reduce the size of my window.     i've trouble shot this issue by downloading a fresh copy of   and creating a new html file (code supplied below) then adding the carousel template code from the   website in and placing the images i was using. after doing so, the images are still not bleeding to the edges when my browser is open to it's maximum width.     i've never had this issue before with   or the carousel and so i'm completely stumped. is the default width of  img  not 100% because it sure looked like it was in the   .css  file. additionally i've added  img width:100% !important  to the  head  of my document and everything returned to the way it was before this issue occurred.     i'm wondering if this is just a change that was made recently and when i updated   it changed everything? and if so, is the carousel not supposed to stretch the image to the edges?      html       head           meta charset="utf-8"           link rel="stylesheet" href="css/ .css"       /head       body           !-- carousel --           div id="mycarousel" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel"               !-- indicators --               ol class="carousel-indicators"                   li data-target="#mycarousel" data-slide-to="0" class="active"  /li                   li data-target="#mycarousel" data-slide-to="1"  /li                   li data-target="#mycarousel" data-slide-to="2"  /li               /ol               div class="carousel-inner"                   div class="item active"                       img src="img/hero-1.jpg" alt="first slide"                       div class="container"                           div class="carousel-caption"  /div                       /div                   /div                   div class="item"                       img src="img/hero-2.jpg" alt="second slide"                       div class="container"                           div class="carousel-caption"  /div                       /div                   /div                   div class="item"                       img src="img/hero-3.jpg" alt="third slide"                       div class="container"                           div class="carousel-caption"  /div                       /div                   /div               /div               a class="left carousel-control" href="#mycarousel" data-slide="prev"  span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"  /span  /a               a class="right carousel-control" href="#mycarousel" data-slide="next"  span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"  /span  /a           /div           !-- javascript --           script src="js/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"  /script           script src="js/ .js"  /script       /body   /html
