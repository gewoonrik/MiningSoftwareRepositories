Bootstrap 3.0.3 Navbar Collapse Cross Browser Issue  I am new to Bootstrap and am attempting to configure a simple responsive navbar but I have run into an issue.     When I run the code in  Chrome  it runs just fine and everything looks like it should.         However, when I run the same code in  IE or Firefox  the collapsed menu gets messed up and appears in the center of the screen rather than starting below the brand.         Here is the code from the body of my program:         I have been following a couple tutorials on Youtube and they all seem to lay it out like this and I always run into the same issue. Is this something that has changed with Bootstrap 3.0.3?
