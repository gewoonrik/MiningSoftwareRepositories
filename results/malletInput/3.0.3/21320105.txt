  3.0.3 navbar collapse cross browser issue  i am new to   and am attempting to configure a simple responsive navbar but i have run into an issue.     when i run the code in  chrome  it runs just fine and everything looks like it should.         however, when i run the same code in  ie or firefox  the collapsed menu gets messed up and appears in the center of the screen rather than starting below the brand.         here is the code from the body of my program:      div class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-top"       div class="navbar-inner"           div class="container"               div class="navbar-brand"                  brand              /div                button type="button" class="navbar-toggle"                      data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navheadercollapse"                   span class="icon-bar"  /span                   span class="icon-bar"  /span                   span class="icon-bar"  /span               /button                div class="collapse navbar-collapse navheadercollapse"                   ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"                       li  a href="#" home /a  /li                       li  a href="#" store /a  /li                       li  a href="#" contact /a  /li                       li  a href="#" about /a  /li                   /ul               /div           /div       /div   /div       i have been following a couple tutorials on youtube and they all seem to lay it out like this and i always run into the same issue. is this something that has changed with   3.0.3?
