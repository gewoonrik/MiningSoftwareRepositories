RoR & Twitter Bootstrap 3 - cols, no matter the dimension always appear in new row  I am following Michael Hartl's  Ruby on Rails tutorial currently but decided to work with the newest Twitter Bootstrap 3. I am just experimenting around with the grid system but I can't seem to get the cols, no matter if it is col-sx-, col-sm-, col-md- or col-lg- to appear beside each other. I am using the sass-rails 4.0.1 gem and  -sass 3.0.3.0.    Here's my code:         and this is how it is rendered:        How do I get the columns to appear beside each other as they should?
