ror &     3 - cols, no matter the dimension always appear in new row  i am following michael hartl's  ruby on rails tutorial currently but decided to work with the newest     3. i am just experimenting around with the grid system but i can't seem to get the cols, no matter if it is col-sx-, col-sm-, col-md- or col-lg- to appear beside each other. i am using the sass-rails 4.0.1 gem and  -sass 3.0.3.0.    here's my code:      div class="container"   div class="row"       div class="col-md-1"           h1 l /h1       /div       div class="col-md-1"           p hh /p       /div   /div   div class="row"       div class="col-md-5"           h1 logo /h1       /div       div class="col-md-7"           a href="#" some link /a           a href="#" some link /a       /div   /div   /div       and this is how it is rendered:        how do i get the columns to appear beside each other as they should?
