Bootstrap modal wont trigger on mobile  I am a long time reader, new poster.    I am designing a website in   and would like to have my pop-ups work on mobile, the self-defense section won't trigger on mobile and it is quite upsetting!    below is the url, i am using   CDN and jquery CDN        I looked over the code and nothing seems wrong as the home-defense works just fine.
