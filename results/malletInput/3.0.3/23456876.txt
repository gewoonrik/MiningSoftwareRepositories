  modal wont trigger on mobile  i am a long time reader, new poster.    i am designing a website in   and would like to have my pop-ups work on mobile, the self-defense section won't trigger on mobile and it is quite upsetting!    below is the url, i am using   cdn and jquery cdn        i looked over the code and nothing seems wrong as the home-defense works just fine.
