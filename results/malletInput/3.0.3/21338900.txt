Migrating from   3.0.0 to 3.0.1  I actually tried to upgrade from   3.0.0 to 3.0.3 and experienced a problem.  So I rolled back versions of   and determined that the issue first presents in   3.0.1.    When I upgrade my columns are all shifted horrifically.  I realize I am asking a question without posting any source, but I would like to know if there is a migration guide for moving from 3.0.0 to later versions of   or any any things I should be looking out for?    I was surprised by the drastic changes in such a minor version upgrade.  I wonder if I must have been applying   incorrectly, or did others face similar work in retrofitting their app?
