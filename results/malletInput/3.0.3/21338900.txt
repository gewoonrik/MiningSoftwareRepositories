migrating from   3.0.0 to 3.0.1  i actually tried to upgrade from   3.0.0 to 3.0.3 and experienced a problem.  so i rolled back versions of   and determined that the issue first presents in   3.0.1.    when i upgrade my columns are all shifted horrifically.  i realize i am asking a question without posting any source, but i would like to know if there is a migration guide for moving from 3.0.0 to later versions of   or any any things i should be looking out for?    i was surprised by the drastic changes in such a minor version upgrade.  i wonder if i must have been applying   incorrectly, or did others face similar work in retrofitting their app?
