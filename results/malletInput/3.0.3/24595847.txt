how to access refreshview() in     datepicker for angular?   edit  it actually does it right out of the box.    i leave the plunker here just in case someone drops in via search:        i need to disable disable specific dates in a datepicker based on user input.    the datepicker offers isdisabled(date) but that only gets fired once. it does however have a refreshview() as per:    /issues/779     what i can't figure out is how to trigger it after a change.
