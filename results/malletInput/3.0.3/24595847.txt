How to access refreshView() in Twitter Bootstrap Datepicker for Angular?   EDIT  It actually does it right out of the box.    I leave the plunker here just in case someone drops in via search:        I need to disable disable specific dates in a datepicker based on user input.    The datepicker offers isDisabled(date) but that only gets fired once. It does however have a refreshView() as per:    /issues/779     What I can't figure out is how to trigger it after a change.
