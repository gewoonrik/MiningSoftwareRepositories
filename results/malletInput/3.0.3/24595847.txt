how to access refreshview() in     datepicker for angular?   edit  it actually does it right out of the box.    i leave the plunker here just in case someone drops in via search:        i need to disable disable specific dates in a datepicker based on user input.    the datepicker offers isdisabled(date) but that only gets fired once. it does however have a refreshview() as per:    /issues/779     what i can't figure out is how to trigger it after a change.      !doctype html   html ng-app="plunker"     head       script src=" "  /script       script src="  /ui- -tpls-0.10.0.js"  /script       script src="example.js"  /script       link href="//netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.3/css/ .min.css" rel="stylesheet"     /head     body       div ng-controller="datepickerdemoctrl"          h4 inline /h4         div style="display:inline-block; min-height:290px;"           div class="well well-sm" ng-model="dt" ng-change="change()"               datepicker  /datepicker           /div         /div       /div     /body   /html       and the js     angular.module('plunker', ['ui. ']); var datepickerdemoctrl = function ($scope) {   $scope.change = function(){     console.log('changed to ' + $scope.dt);     // get array of disabled dates     // call refreshview();  --- my problem, right here   }; };      i've ommitted the part where i define an array of disabled dates and the isdisabled function that checks against that. what i only need to know is how to trigger the refreshview()    edit:    this is what i want to call/trigger in ui- -tpls.js       this.refreshview = function() {     if ( this.element ) {       this._refreshview();        var date = ngmodelctrl.$modelvalue ? new date(ngmodelctrl.$modelvalue) : null;       ngmodelctrl.$setvalidity('date-disabled', !date || (this.element    !this.isdisabled(date)));     }   };
