do i need to use jquery map?  i'm including jquery via this google cdn:     //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js      the only reason i'm using jquery is because of  , which i'm loading from this cdn:     //netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.3/js/ .min.js      the problem is that whenever my page loads, the slowest file to come is  jquery.min.map . which returns a 304 get and takes over 50ms to load. i understand javascript maps are to debug obfuscated/minified code? not sure why i'd need this in a production application.     thanks!
