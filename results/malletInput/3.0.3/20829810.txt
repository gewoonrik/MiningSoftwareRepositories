zooming vs responsive design in    i am working on a website which uses  's css for responsive design (version 3.0.3). for many elements in the page i have used   classes like bordered tables, top navigation bar, form-controls, etc.    my problem is, when i zoom in above a particular level, the layout design of the site breaks. for example, i have checkboxes in the first column of each row in a table. the checkbox is aligned to be at the center of the table cell. but when i zoom in, the checkbox moves to one end of the cell instead of staying at the centre. besides, all elements don't increase in size proportionately. what can i do?    especially, i would like to know if there is a simple css solution to make zooming increase the size of all objects uniformly without breaking the layout, without needing any extra javascript coding or something like that. i have checked out some popular sites like youtube, facebook, etc. they all zoom proportionately without losing their layout design. do they do this with extra javascript or is there a simple css solution?
