Zooming vs Responsive design in Bootstrap  I am working on a website which uses Bootstrap's CSS for responsive design (version 3.0.3). For many elements in the page I have used Bootstrap classes like bordered tables, top navigation bar, form-controls, etc.    My problem is, when I zoom in above a particular level, the layout design of the site breaks. For example, I have checkboxes in the first column of each row in a table. The checkbox is aligned to be at the center of the table cell. But when I zoom in, the checkbox moves to one end of the cell instead of staying at the centre. Besides, all elements don't increase in size proportionately. What can I do?    Especially, I would like to know if there is a simple CSS solution to make zooming increase the size of all objects uniformly without breaking the layout, without needing any extra JavaScript coding or something like that. I have checked out some popular sites like YouTube, Facebook, etc. They all zoom proportionately without losing their layout design. Do they do this with extra JavaScript or is there a simple CSS solution?
