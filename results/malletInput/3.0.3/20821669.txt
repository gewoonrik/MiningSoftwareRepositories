  modals blank with cdn-delivered js & css resources  i'm pretty stuck on this problem that i'm having getting   modals to pop up. here's an example:                  div class="container"             h2 example of creating modals with     /h2             div id="example" class="modal hide fade in" style="display: none; "                 div class="modal-header"                     a class="close" data-dismiss="modal" ã— /a                     h3 this is a modal heading /h3                 /div                 div class="modal-body"                     h4 text in a modal /h4                     p you can add some text here. /p                               /div                 div class="modal-footer"                     a href="#" class="btn btn-success" call to action /a                     a href="#" class="btn" data-dismiss="modal" close /a                 /div             /div         p  a data-toggle="modal" href="#example" class="btn btn-primary btn-large"  launch demo modal /a  /p         /div       and pulling the css from:      //netdna. cdn.com/ /3.0.3/css/ .css      essentially, the when the button is pressed, the modal tries to load (the style changes to the body happen which causes it to dim), but the  tags containing the modal content never get rendered.     i believe this is a css problem at heart. when you remove the css and rerun, the styles go away, of course, but clicking on the anchor actually causes the change to happen.     i have to assume it's something that i'm doing, so could anyone look at the jsfiddle example and let me know where my error is?     thanks in advance!
