  responsiveness on mobile  i have this weird problem. i have just set up a page, built with   3.0.3, on my own web server.    my problem is the responsive part, it works fine in chrome and firefox and even on my mobile when i put up a public link via dropbox. but when i try to access it from my web server using my mobile, samsung galaxy s3, it stops to work. i get the whole page instead of being shrunk to the mobile version.    i have included the view port:      meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"       when running a test on googles page speed page i get an error stating the viewport doesn't exist.    my webserver is running on a raspberry pi with nginx.
