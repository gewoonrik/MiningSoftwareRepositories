Bootstrap responsiveness on mobile  i have this weird problem. I have just set up a page, built with   3.0.3, on my own web server.    My problem is the responsive part, it works fine in chrome and firefox and even on my mobile when i put up a public link via dropbox. But when i try to access it from my web server using my mobile, samsung galaxy s3, it stops to work. I get the whole page instead of being shrunk to the mobile version.    I have included the view port:         When running a test on googles page speed page i get an error stating the viewport doesn't exist.    My webserver is running on a raspberry pi with nginx.
