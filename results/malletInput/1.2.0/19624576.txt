angularjs ng-click broken by {{$index}}  i'm having an issue with angularjs where when i use $index it breaks the ng-click function.    this is being done within a div that uses ng-repeat, the repeat code works correctly...         without using {{$index}} to generate the zero, it works perfectly...    i've tried with angular 1.0.6 and 1.2.0    also, i'm using jquery 1.7 and   3.0 if that makes a difference.    has anyone run into this?  if so, what am i doing wrong?
