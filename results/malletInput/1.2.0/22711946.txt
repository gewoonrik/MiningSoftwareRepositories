assets loaded twice yiistrap  we are using yiistrap 1.2.0 and yiiwheels. we have registered the yiistrap client scripts/css as mentioned in the manual, in the main.php layout:     yii::app()-  - register();       css is then loaded in the head section:      link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/assets/249df900/css/ -formhelpers.css" /   link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/assets/249df900/css/ -formhelpers-countries.flags.css" /       but when we include a widget like:             $this- widget(             'yiiwheels.widgets.formhelpers.whcountries',             array(                 'name' =  'invoice[i_country]',                 'value' =  $model- i_country,                 'usehelperselectbox' =  true,                 'pluginoptions' =  array(                     'country' =  'us',                     'flags' =  true                 ),             )         );      the css and all js gets loaded again further in the source, to be precise on every spot where a widget is called.     seems like yii loses track of scripts/css that was already included.  where do i need to look to fix this?
