assets loaded twice yiistrap  we are using yiistrap 1.2.0 and yiiwheels. we have registered the yiistrap client scripts/css as mentioned in the manual, in the main.php layout:         the css and all js gets loaded again further in the source, to be precise on every spot where a widget is called.     seems like yii loses track of scripts/css that was already included.  where do i need to look to fix this?
