Assets loaded twice Yiistrap  We are using Yiistrap 1.2.0 and YiiWheels. We have registered the YiiStrap client scripts/CSS as mentioned in the manual, in the main.php layout:         The CSS and all JS gets loaded again further in the source, to be precise on every spot where a widget is called.     Seems like Yii loses track of scripts/CSS that was already included.  Where do I need to look to fix this?
