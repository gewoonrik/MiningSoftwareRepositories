jQuery horizontal sliding transition for all the pages links in a site?  I'd like to use jQuery and Bootstrap in Wordpress so I am using  Bootstrapwp . I am new to all this stuff so please forgive my naive question...     -> I am looking for a way to add something like the jQuery mobile transition "sliding" (horizontal sliding) to all my site links.    This jQuery mobile code doesn't work alone:  and if I load jquery.mobile-1.2.0.min.js file added to the loaded  .js, it bugs...    How could I manage that?    Thanks for your help PAul
