Nested ng-repeat undefined errors in AngularJS  I'm having an issue with a very simple nested ng-repeat with AngularJS 1.2.0-rc3.    I have a JSON object inside my controller representing a menu structure, like this:         Is there something wrong with my markup? The error appears sometimes on page load, and always when I click on a submenu (in my code the actions are replaced simply by an "#").
