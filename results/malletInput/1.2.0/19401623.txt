nested ng-repeat undefined errors in angularjs  i'm having an issue with a very simple nested ng-repeat with angularjs 1.2.0-rc3.    i have a json object inside my controller representing a menu structure, like this:     $scope.menus = [   {     title: "menu1",      action: "#",      menus: [       {         title: "submenu1_1",         action: "stuff"       },       {         title: "submenu1_2",         action: "morestuff"       }     ]   },   {     title: "menu2",      action: "#",      menus: [       {         title: "submenu2_1",         action: "awesomestuff"       },       {         title: "submenu2_2",         action: "moreawesomestuff"       }     ]   } ]      my view uses this information to create a    nav  menu structure, like this:      div class="navbar"     ul class="nav navbar-nav"       li ng-repeat="menu in menus" ng-class="{dropdown: menu.menus}"         a href="{{menu.action}}" ng-class="{'dropdown-toggle': menu.menus}" data-toggle="dropdown" {{menu.title}} /a         ul ng-if="menu.menus" class="dropdown-menu"           li ng-repeat="submenu in menu.menus"             a href="{{submenu.action}}" {{submenu.title}} /a           /li         /ul       /li     /ul   /div       this should work fine, and it does... 50% of the time. sometimes, almost randomly, the menu won't show up at all and i'll get this error in the console:     error: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'node.childnodes')      is there something wrong with my markup? the error appears sometimes on page load, and always when i click on a submenu (in my code the actions are replaced simply by an "#").
