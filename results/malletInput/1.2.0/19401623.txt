nested ng-repeat undefined errors in angularjs  i'm having an issue with a very simple nested ng-repeat with angularjs 1.2.0-rc3.    i have a json object inside my controller representing a menu structure, like this:         is there something wrong with my markup? the error appears sometimes on page load, and always when i click on a submenu (in my code the actions are replaced simply by an "#").
