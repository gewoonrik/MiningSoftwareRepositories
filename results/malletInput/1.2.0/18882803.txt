UI Bootstrap Typahead async not working in AngularJS RC2  Why is the UI Bootstrap Typahead not working in AngularJS RC2 when using the $http service   to retreive matches from server? This was working in AngularJS RC1    See  this plunker using RC1  and  this using RC2  (test with typing at least 3 letters e.g. 'bos')    EDIT:    IÂ´m not sure whether this is an AngularJS issue or UI Bootstrap issue    Error:
