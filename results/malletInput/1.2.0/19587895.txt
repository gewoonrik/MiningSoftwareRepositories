Angular-ui-  typehead not working with AngularJS 1.2.0-rc3  Here is a working example of Angular-ui-  typehead working with AngularJS 1.0.5:        The template uses ng-bind-html-unsafe witch is deprecated in AngularJS 1.2.0-rc3.    How can I bind html unsafe in that template? I would have used ng-bind but the filter typeaheadHighlight:query adds  tags in match.model.title.    Thanks!
