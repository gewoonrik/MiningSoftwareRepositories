angular-ui-  typehead not working with angularjs 1.2.0-rc3  here is a working example of angular-ui-  typehead working with angularjs 1.0.5:        the template uses ng-bind-html-unsafe witch is deprecated in angularjs 1.2.0-rc3.    how can i bind html unsafe in that template? i would have used ng-bind but the filter typeaheadhighlight:query adds  tags in match.model.title.    thanks!
