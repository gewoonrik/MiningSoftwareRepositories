  in cms - error with script generating navigation  i am creating a site that runs in the     framework. the end result i am working towards is a site that has mobile swipe functionality between pages. to achieve this, i created "pages" inside the   carousel and am also using jquery mobile to enable swipe. i am using the javascript found in this example -     - to create the links in my navigation.    the issue i am having is in the scripting.. my navigation does not generate the links when i place this code in my cms, drupal. when i save the generated page source and run the file from either another host (outside of any cms) or when i run the file from my local system, everything generates and runs perfectly. i have limited access to the cms meaning i cannot change the doctype from strict or add any data to the head.    so, my question is this: why is this happening? the generated page source is below (minus page analytics code from omniture).         does anyone know why it would remove the list elements and add in a div tag? or if there is a better way of coding this section so that it does not get modified.
