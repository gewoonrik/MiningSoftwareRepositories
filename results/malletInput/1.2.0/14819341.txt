Bootstrap in CMS - error with script generating navigation  I am creating a site that runs in the Twitter Bootstrap framework. The end result I am working towards is a site that has mobile swipe functionality between pages. To achieve this, I created "pages" inside the Bootstrap carousel and am also using jquery mobile to enable swipe. I am using the javascript found in this example -     - to create the links in my navigation.    The issue I am having is in the scripting.. My navigation does not generate the links when I place this code in my CMS, Drupal. When I save the generated page source and run the file from either another host (outside of any CMS) or when I run the file from my local system, everything generates and runs perfectly. I have limited access to the CMS meaning I cannot change the doctype from strict or add any data to the head.    So, my question is this: why is this happening? The generated page source is below (minus page analytics code from Omniture).         Does anyone know why it would remove the list elements and add in a div tag? Or if there is a better way of coding this section so that it does not get modified.
