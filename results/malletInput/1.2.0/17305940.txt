Is CWSpear`s hover dropdown menu amd ready (require.js)?  I was trying to make use of the  CWSpear`s plugin , for dropdown menus with hover, using require.js.  But I keep getting an error for it: "Error: Script error". What do I need to do with in order to use it with require.js?    EDIT:    To help @jakee by focusing the question, this is the configuration I've made :      line, in the defines, it works fine. If it tries to load that script, it fails.
