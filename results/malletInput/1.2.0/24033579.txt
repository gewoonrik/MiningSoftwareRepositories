How do I limit jQuery dependency in Bootstrap with my project bower.json?  I need to support IE8 in a web app and have to make sure jquery 1.10+ is used and not 2.0+.    My project bower.json file has dependencies listed like so:         How can I modify my bower.json dependences to 'restrict' the Bootstrap jQuery dependency it's own config file will install?    Hope that makes sense.  Thanks!
