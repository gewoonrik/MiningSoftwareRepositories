Bootstrap Button Loading State - Safari  The code below produces the desired result in Chrome, Firefox,   IE but not in Safari. I have searched and found many solutions - including on here - yet I cannot get it to work and have copied and pasted the code - any thoughts?  I am using the latest jQuery   Bootstrap 2.2.1 - hence why I am not having to load a  -button.js because it's integrated in Bootstrap 2.2.1.    Thanks,
