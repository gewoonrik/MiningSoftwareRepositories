  button loading state - safari  the code below produces the desired result in chrome, firefox,   ie but not in safari. i have searched and found many solutions - including on here - yet i cannot get it to work and have copied and pasted the code - any thoughts?  i am using the latest jquery     2.2.1 - hence why i am not having to load a  -button.js because it's integrated in   2.2.1.    thanks,
