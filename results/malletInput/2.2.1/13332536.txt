why can't I see the box-shadow for twitter   navbar?  In version 2.0.4 of  Twitter Bootstrap  I added a box shadow to my nav-bar and it worked great. (see the image below)         I recently upgraded to version 2.2.1 and tried doing the same but I fail to see the box shadow below my navbar.  Here is my current style:         Any ideas why the drop shadow isn't appearing in 2.2.1?
