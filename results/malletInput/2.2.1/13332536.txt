why can't i see the box-shadow for     navbar?  in version 2.0.4 of       i added a box shadow to my nav-bar and it worked great. (see the image below)         i recently upgraded to version 2.2.1 and tried doing the same but i fail to see the box shadow below my navbar.  here is my current style:         any ideas why the drop shadow isn't appearing in 2.2.1?
