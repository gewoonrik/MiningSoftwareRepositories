    typeahead with json  how can i use     typeahead with json. my   version is  2.2.1      my json response         [{"label":"sistemski administrator","value":"1"},{"label":"jure hotujec","value":"3"},{"label":" ","value":"4"},{"label":"simona jamnik","value":"5"},{"label":"ma\u0161a mu\u0161i\u010d","value":"6"},{"label":" ","value":"7"}]      all i've got now is this, but the source must be array and in my case it's json     $("#typeahead").autocomplete({     soruce : soruce });      also i would like to use it with modal element, if that changes anything.    thanks!
