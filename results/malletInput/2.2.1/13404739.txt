what is the proper way to override an element's css 'position: relative;' using   2.2.1?  i am working on a project using the     2.2.1 initializr boilerplate. in order to properly override  's default css attributes you need to create an entry for the affected class in 'main.css' and add the desired attributes.    in this particular case   has a class called '.collapse' that is applied to the default navbar.         the portion that is causing problems for me is the 'position: relative;'. i need there to be no position statement. now i know that i can just open the   css file and edit it but if the file gets updated that change will be lost.    what is the proper way of overriding this css entry?
