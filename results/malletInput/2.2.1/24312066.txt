navbar on top of google map with      with   2.2.1, i have the following layout      div class="container-fluid"       div class="row-fluid"           div class="span9"               div id="map_canvas"  /div           /div           div class="span3"               div class="well sidebar-nav"                 ul class="nav nav-list"                   li class="nav-header" title /li                   li ... /li                 /ul               /div           /div       /div   /div       the css of my map is:     #map_canvas{     width: 100%;     height:700px; }      this displays a map and a sidebar nav on the right, with too much margins (!).    what i'd like to achieve is the following:      having the map that occupy the full width and height (width no right and left margin)     having the nav bar on top of the map (still on the right) with a light transparency so the map can be seen.      any pointer on how to do that with this version of   ?
