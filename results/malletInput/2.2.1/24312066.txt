Navbar on top of Google Map with Twitter Bootstrap  With   2.2.1, I have the following layout         This displays a map and a sidebar nav on the right, with too much margins (!).    What I'd like to achieve is the following:      having the map that occupy the full width and height (width no right and left margin)     having the nav bar on top of the map (still on the right) with a light transparency so the map can be seen.      Any pointer on how to do that with this version of   ?
