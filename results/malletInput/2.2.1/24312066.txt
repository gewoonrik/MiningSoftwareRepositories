navbar on top of google map with      with   2.2.1, i have the following layout         this displays a map and a sidebar nav on the right, with too much margins (!).    what i'd like to achieve is the following:      having the map that occupy the full width and height (width no right and left margin)     having the nav bar on top of the map (still on the right) with a light transparency so the map can be seen.      any pointer on how to do that with this version of   ?
