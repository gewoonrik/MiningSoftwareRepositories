  collapse stopped working - "blinking" rails  i had   collapse (  -transition.js v2.2.1 ) working in my rails project working and now it blinks. the scenario is the page loads, i click a button to open the inner-collapse, which works fine, then when i click to close it it blinks and stays expanded.         button type="button" class="btn btn-info offset3" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo" show completed /button  br     div class="pull-left offset2 collapse" id="demo"       ul class="task-list" id="completed"          table            tbody              tr                td  %= render "completed" %  /td              /tr            /tbody             /table       /ul     /div       js on page      script type="text/javascript"      $("#demo").collapse("hide");  /script       there has been some additional ajax work on this view, but my question is what are my checks? i have spent about 2 days on this problem checking everything i think it could be to no avail so finally i need to ask for help. when i try to implement collapse on any page it does the same blinking.       .js and bootsrap.css.scs 2.2.1, rails 3.2.8      what am i overlooking? thanks for your attention and for taking a look.
