Grails Twitter Bootstrap Modal load content in Server-side fashion  I'm using Grails 2.2.1 and the Twitter Bootstrap plugin.    If I understand correctly, the point of GSP is to render certain things on the server side via grails tags/taglibs.    How would I call an action  myAction  with controller  myController  to be rendered  inside the modal only, using a server-side approach?     If there is not a server-side way of doing this, what would be the best alternative?
