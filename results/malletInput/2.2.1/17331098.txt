grails     modal load content in server-side fashion  i'm using grails 2.2.1 and the     plugin.    if i understand correctly, the point of gsp is to render certain things on the server side via grails tags/taglibs.    how would i call an action  myaction  with controller  mycontroller  to be rendered  inside the modal only, using a server-side approach?     if there is not a server-side way of doing this, what would be the best alternative?
