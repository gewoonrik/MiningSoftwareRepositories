typeahead from Bootstrap v2.2.1 skips every other value on key up or down in Firefox  I'm not sure if it's a new bug was introduced to TB or it's me, but it works in Chrome and IE, but doe NOT work in Firefox.    typeahead skips every other value on key up or down when suggestions are shown.         Twitter Bootstrap 2.2.1  jQuery 1.8.3  Firefox 16.0.2    Opened the bug anyway:    /issues/5943         DEMO2  (start typing 'm') or  Official typeahead demo at TB site  (start typing 'a')
