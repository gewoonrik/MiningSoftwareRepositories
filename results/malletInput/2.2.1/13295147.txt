how can i disable shrinking/resiziing images in    ?  i have the following set-up        2.2.1   html loaded in a layer via ajax    layer is 600 px width on a desktop monitor      i want to show small images (32x32 pixel):       img src="/img/icon_line.png" class="img-polaroid" width="32" height="32" /       what happens is that they got shrinked to tiny size through the following css rule in  .css:     img {   width: auto\9;   height: auto;   max-width: 100%;   vertical-align: middle;   border: 0;   -ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic; }      how can i avoid this and show the icons  in full size in my layer?     update:   i figured out that this occurs when the images are in a table and the table rows have much text inside and everything is in a layer.    here is a simplified example of my use case:      long text, broken:    /broken.html    short  text, ok:    /ok.html    example as zip file:    /bsbug.zip        fixed version:          /fixed.html
