How can I disable shrinking/resiziing images in Twitter Bootstrap?  I have the following set-up      Bootstrap 2.2.1   HTML loaded in a layer via AJAX    layer is 600 px width on a desktop monitor      I want to show small images (32x32 pixel):          How can I avoid this and show the icons  in full size in my layer?     Update:   I figured out that this occurs when the images are in a table and the table rows have much text inside and everything is in a layer.    Here is a simplified example of my use case:      Long text, broken:    /broken.html    Short  text, ok:    /ok.html    Example as zip file:    /bsbug.zip        Fixed version:          /fixed.html
