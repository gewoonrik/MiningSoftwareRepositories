inputs have very small height  i used   a lot of times before, but now in my gae project i have a problem â€” the input elements have really small height. buttons, for example, are ok:         html code:         screenshot from dev tools:         edit 2: removed height:20px rule from  , now it's ok. but why it was there?      version is 2.2.1. screenshot was made in chrome 23.0.1271.95, mac os x 10.8.
