inputs have very small height  i used   a lot of times before, but now in my gae project i have a problem â€” the input elements have really small height. buttons, for example, are ok:         html code:      div class="container"      div class="row"         div class="span6 pull-right"            div class="well well-small"            form               input id="length" class="input-small" name="length" type="text" value="8"               br/               input type="number" value="8"               br/               input type="submit" class="btn btn-success" value="generate"             !-- etc --       screenshot from dev tools:         edit 2: removed height:20px rule from  , now it's ok. but why it was there?      version is 2.2.1. screenshot was made in chrome 23.0.1271.95, mac os x 10.8.
