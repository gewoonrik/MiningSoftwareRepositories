Inputs have very small height  I used   a lot of times before, but now in my GAE project I have a problem â€” the input elements have really small height. Buttons, for example, are OK:         HTML code:         Screenshot from dev tools:         Edit 2: Removed height:20px rule from  , now it's OK. But why it was there?    Bootstrap version is 2.2.1. Screenshot was made in Chrome 23.0.1271.95, Mac OS X 10.8.
