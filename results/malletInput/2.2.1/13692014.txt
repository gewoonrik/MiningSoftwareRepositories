 's media-grid class with django?  i am pretty new to  django  and i encountered a problem with the  media-grid  class of      : instead of displaying a gallery, i am only able to make normal lists of images.    i am using   2.2.1 with django 1.4.1 on windows xp. i copied the   files in my project folder and i made a very simple html template to test  's  media-grid  class. my goal is to visualize a simple gallery of images from my database.     the correct syntax for the  media-grid  class is defined  here  as:         i have tried to write it down differently, and unsuccessfully looked online for a solution for 2 days. if you have an idea of why this code may not be working, please let me know.     thanks everyone in advance.
