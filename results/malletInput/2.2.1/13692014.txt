Bootstrap's media-grid class with Django?  I am pretty new to  Django  and I encountered a problem with the  media-grid  class of Twitter  Bootstrap : instead of displaying a gallery, I am only able to make normal lists of images.    I am using Bootstrap 2.2.1 with Django 1.4.1 on Windows XP. I copied the Bootstrap files in my project folder and I made a very simple HTML template to test Bootstrap's  media-grid  class. My goal is to visualize a simple gallery of images from my database.     The correct syntax for the  media-grid  class is defined  here  as:         I have tried to write it down differently, and unsuccessfully looked online for a solution for 2 days. If you have an idea of why this code may not be working, please let me know.     Thanks everyone in advance.
