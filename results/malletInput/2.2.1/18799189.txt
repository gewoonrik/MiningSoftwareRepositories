  typeahead not working with dynamic array retrieved from a php page  i was trying to create a autocomplete box that gets stock symbols and names from finance.yahoo.com according to the user query typed in typeahead text box.    i created a  quote_form.php  page in which there is a text box on which i applied jquery keyup function to get the characters when typed by the user and then based on that characters i made a get request inside my typeahead function on my php page called  symbols.php  which inturn calls this link below:        $search region=us lang=en-us callback=yahoo.util.scriptnodedatasource.callbacks     in the above link $search contains the characters received by get request and then in response i received json data with some junk i cleared the junk and then made it a legitimate json data and from that json data i created a string that looks like javascript array with the field i needed from the json. so, when my  quote_form.php  receives that data it does not shows it in typeahead. i surely receive data as i have seen in chrome's inspect element's network tab. the code for both the pages is as below, i have created a seperate html header so i will not include the same as it is not necessary:    i have included the necessary javascript files and css files:     jquery version used: 1.8.2        version used: v2.2.1      quote_form.php           script type ="text/javascript"      $(document).ready(function () {     var key;     $("input[name='symbol']").keyup(function() {         console.log("key pressed");         window.key = $(this).val();     });      $("input[name='symbol']").typeahead({         source: function(query, process) {         return $.get('symbols.php', {s: window.key}, function(data) {             console.log(data);             return process(data);             });         }     });  });   /script    form action="quote.php" method="post"       fieldset           div class="control-group"               input id = "sy" autofocus autocomplete ="off" name="symbol" placeholder="symbol" type="text"/           /div           div class="control-group"               button type="submit" class="btn" get quote /button           /div       /fieldset   /form        symbols.php       ?php     $search = $_get['s'];      $url = " ";      $raw_data =  @file_get_contents($url);      $json = substr($raw_data, strpos($raw_data,'result"') - 1);     $json = rtrim($json, '})');     $json = "{" . $json . "}";      $result = json_decode($json, true);      $jsarr = "[";     foreach($result as $symbols)     {     foreach($symbols as $symbol)     {         $jsarr .= "'".$symbol['name'] . " " . $symbol['symbol'] . "', ";     }     }      $jsarr .= "]";      echo $jsarr; ?       i also tried the above code without converting to javascript array i.e i also tried with json only but that didn't work either. seen many examples on internet also but still i am missing something don't know what. if any body can figure out what i am doing wrong that would be a great relief for me.    thanks in advance.
