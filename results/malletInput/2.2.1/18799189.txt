  typeahead not working with dynamic array retrieved from a php page  i was trying to create a autocomplete box that gets stock symbols and names from finance.yahoo.com according to the user query typed in typeahead text box.    i created a  quote_form.php  page in which there is a text box on which i applied jquery keyup function to get the characters when typed by the user and then based on that characters i made a get request inside my typeahead function on my php page called  symbols.php  which inturn calls this link below:        $search region=us lang=en-us callback=yahoo.util.scriptnodedatasource.callbacks     in the above link $search contains the characters received by get request and then in response i received json data with some junk i cleared the junk and then made it a legitimate json data and from that json data i created a string that looks like javascript array with the field i needed from the json. so, when my  quote_form.php  receives that data it does not shows it in typeahead. i surely receive data as i have seen in chrome's inspect element's network tab. the code for both the pages is as below, i have created a seperate html header so i will not include the same as it is not necessary:    i have included the necessary javascript files and css files:     jquery version used: 1.8.2        version used: v2.2.1      quote_form.php          i also tried the above code without converting to javascript array i.e i also tried with json only but that didn't work either. seen many examples on internet also but still i am missing something don't know what. if any body can figure out what i am doing wrong that would be a great relief for me.    thanks in advance.
