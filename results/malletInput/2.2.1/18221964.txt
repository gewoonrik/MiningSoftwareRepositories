fluid row div stacking order - columnize when possible  i have the following stacking order for my footer     span2 |     span 8    | span2      if i halve the screen size, the stacking order is as follows:     |     span 8    | |     span 2    | |     span 2    |      but i want them to stack like this and i know there is enough space for 'span2's:     |     span 8    | | span2 | span2 |       how can i achieve this? i tried appending  col-sm-6  to each  span2 , but with no luck (boostrap  3.0.0-wip  and  2.2.1 no-icon )
