can i set the max-width for a responsive layout in  - ?  i just upgraded  -  from 2.0.4 to 2.2.1.  the only issue i have is that my current website now expands to the new  responsive layout  of 1170px and i've optimized my site around a max width of 940 pixels.  does anyone know if it's possible to set the new responsive layout to have a max width of 940px?    my current meta tag looks like this:      meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"       any thoughts?
