upgrading gwt,   and gwt-   currently i am using gwt 2.5.1 and   2.3.2 versions. and also i am using gwt  (com.github.gwt . ) 2.2.1.0 version. i need to upgrade gwt to 2.6 ,  to 3.1 and gwt  to 2.3.2.0-snapshot versions. these upgradations are latest versions.    will this upgradation works fine without any issues???     i have a question on this because gwt   latest version is 2.x and   version is 3.x, will they be compatible?? can i able to add any latest   styles to gwt  components??  will the added   styles overrides the existing styles of gwt-  wigets?? will it work??  please suggest any ideas..
