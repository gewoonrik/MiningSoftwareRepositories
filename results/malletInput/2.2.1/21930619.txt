Upgrading GWT, Bootstrap and GWT-Bootstrap  Currently I am using GWT 2.5.1 and Bootstrap 2.3.2 versions. And also I am using GWTBootstrap (com.github.gwt .Bootstrap) 2.2.1.0 version. I need to upgrade GWT to 2.6 ,Bootstrap to 3.1 and GWTBootstrap to 2.3.2.0-Snapshot versions. These upgradations are latest versions.    Will this upgradation works fine without any issues???     I have a question on this because GWTBootstrap  latest version is 2.x and   version is 3.x, will they be compatible?? Can I able to add any latest   styles to GWTBootstrap components??  Will the added   styles overrides the existing styles of gwt-  wigets?? Will it work??  Please suggest any ideas..
