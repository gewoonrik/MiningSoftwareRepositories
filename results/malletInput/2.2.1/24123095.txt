Bootstrap submit form displayed from javascript timer  I'm trying to create a modal form that is displayed from javascript with a delay.     When I start the modal form with a button (onClick event) the parameters are submitted to the form correctly but when the form is displayed from the timer (with setTimeout) the modal form is displayed but the parameters are not passed to the form. Both cases are in the example below. Any help/links is much appreciated. I just can't figure out what is the difference in the two options:         See example at:
