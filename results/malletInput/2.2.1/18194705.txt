display   popovers outside divs with overflow:hidden  I've got a question about how to get a   popover to show above (outside) a slider, which has a wrapper of overflow:hidden, that I can't seem to get around.    I'm using this slider:     I'm also using Twitter   2.3.2 popovers:    .com/2.3.2/javascript.html#popovers     both work well together with the exception of the overflow:hidden on the carousel, which is similar to issues like this:  Popovers in Bootstrap 2.2.1     /issues/6122     My question specifically is: Has anyone gotten this to work? I've done some moves with height and negative margin to get the vertical height showing, but if the popover is at the edge of my wrapping dive, it will get cut off at the edge. please let me know if I need to provide any additional detail.    Thanks Steph
