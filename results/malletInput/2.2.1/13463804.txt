    table alignment  i'm using     and trying to get two tables to align. i'm starting to think i'm going about it the wrong way. i have two tables one with 3 columns and one with 2 columns. i've set the 3 column table to span6, span2,span4. i've set the 2 column table to span6 and span6. they don't seem to always align in the middle depending on page width. is there any way to accomplish this?    example:             ultimately i'm trying to design a somewhat fluid layout that also has tables that will expand but have a minimum size. any additional suggestions on which layout (from  ) could accomplish this would also be helpful.     thanks!
