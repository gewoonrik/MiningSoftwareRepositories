    table alignment  i'm using     and trying to get two tables to align. i'm starting to think i'm going about it the wrong way. i have two tables one with 3 columns and one with 2 columns. i've set the 3 column table to span6, span2,span4. i've set the 2 column table to span6 and span6. they don't seem to always align in the middle depending on page width. is there any way to accomplish this?    example:          html   head  link href="//netdna. cdn.com/ - /2.2.1/css/ -combined.min.css" rel="stylesheet"  /head        body        table class="table table-bordered table-condensed"       thead       tr           th class="span6" fdsafdfdf f dfdafs sd /th           th class="span2" tesaaat /th           th class="span4" ffdsfsd d /th                            /tr   /thead    /table    table class="table table-bordered table-condensed"   thead   tr       th class="span6"  fdfdf  fds f  /th       th class="span6" test /th   /tr   /thead    /table    /body   /html ​​​​​​​​​​​      ultimately i'm trying to design a somewhat fluid layout that also has tables that will expand but have a minimum size. any additional suggestions on which layout (from  ) could accomplish this would also be helpful.     thanks!
