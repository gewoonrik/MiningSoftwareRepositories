twitter   table alignment  I'm using twitter   and trying to get two tables to align. I'm starting to think I'm going about it the wrong way. I have two tables one with 3 columns and one with 2 columns. I've set the 3 column table to span6, span2,span4. I've set the 2 column table to span6 and span6. They don't seem to always align in the middle depending on page width. Is there any way to accomplish this?    Example:             Ultimately I'm trying to design a somewhat fluid layout that also has tables that will expand but have a minimum size. Any additional suggestions on which layout (from  ) could accomplish this would also be helpful.     Thanks!
