  modal shows up but not interactive  i am having a problem when trying to interact with a simple   modal on my mobile browser.    you can test this page:    .com/javascript/#modals  simply click the "launch demo modal" button in the "live demo" section      when i try to click the popover button or link, it does not work.   i cannot scroll the modal, if i try, the background page start scrolling.   i cannot close the modal using the close icon on top right.      i am using mytouch 3g slide with android v2.2.1    it works fine on desktop though.    thanks for the help
