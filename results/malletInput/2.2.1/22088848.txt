  modal shows up but not interactive  I am having a problem when trying to interact with a simple   modal on my mobile browser.    You can test this page:    .com/javascript/#modals  simply click the "Launch demo modal" button in the "Live demo" section      When I try to click the popover button or link, it does not work.   I cannot scroll the modal, if I try, the background page start scrolling.   I cannot close the modal using the close icon on top right.      I am using MyTouch 3G Slide with Android v2.2.1    It works fine on desktop though.    Thanks for the help
