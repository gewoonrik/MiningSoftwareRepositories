Missing resources for grails   file upload plugin?  I am trying to use the grails   file upload plugin in my grails application (   -file-upload ).    My grails version is 2.2.1. The plugin version is 2.1.2. The plugin installation is successful. I have also installed twitter-  -3.1.1.3 plugin. I am trying to use the UI flavour of the upload plugin. What are the resources that needs to be included. The documentation of the plugin does not talk about it.     Currently I include the following.          Anyone knows how to fix this?
