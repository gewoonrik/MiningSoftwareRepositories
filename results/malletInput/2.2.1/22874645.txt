Spree Commerce Bootstrap Frontend installation fails  I'm trying to install spree_boostrap_frontend (I've tried both with 2-2-stable and master) on my spree 2.2.1 and I get the following error when I try to load the web site:    couldn't find file 'spree/frontend/spree_ ' (in /home/vagrant/mystore/vendor/assets/javascripts/spree/frontend/all.js:13)    Extracted source (around line #10):         (**) line #10 is the one between the double *    Any idea on how to solve it? I also tried to uninstall the gem but the problem still persists (probably I've installed in the wrong way? I've just commented the corresponding line in the Gemfile and then re-ran bundle install)    Alexio
