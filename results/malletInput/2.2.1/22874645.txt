spree commerce   frontend installation fails  i'm trying to install spree_boostrap_frontend (i've tried both with 2-2-stable and master) on my spree 2.2.1 and i get the following error when i try to load the web site:    couldn't find file 'spree/frontend/spree_ ' (in /home/vagrant/mystore/vendor/assets/javascripts/spree/frontend/all.js:13)    extracted source (around line #10):         (**) line #10 is the one between the double *    any idea on how to solve it? i also tried to uninstall the gem but the problem still persists (probably i've installed in the wrong way? i've just commented the corresponding line in the gemfile and then re-ran bundle install)    alexio
