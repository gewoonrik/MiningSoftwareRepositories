Bootstrap: Popovers no longer popping up with in 2.2.1  I have updated my site to use Bootstrap 2.2.1, which was recently released. The previous version I has.. was 2.0.1, if I remember correctly. Anyway, popovers are not working now like they used to. The code I have has not changed at all.. the only change made was to update the   CSS and JS files. However, I now have to click on an anchor tag to display the popover.. and then it doesn't go away after that either. Here is my code:     MARKUP          If anyone can show tell me what changed in the latest version regarding popovers, that'd be great.    PS: I did see this link:  Popovers in Bootstrap 2.2.1  but I don't think it applies in my case.. as I don't have  overflow:hidden  CSS anywhere.. unless I am misunderstanding the problem there... ?
