 : popovers no longer popping up with in 2.2.1  i have updated my site to use   2.2.1, which was recently released. the previous version i has.. was 2.0.1, if i remember correctly. anyway, popovers are not working now like they used to. the code i have has not changed at all.. the only change made was to update the   css and js files. however, i now have to click on an anchor tag to display the popover.. and then it doesn't go away after that either. here is my code:     markup          if anyone can show tell me what changed in the latest version regarding popovers, that'd be great.    ps: i did see this link:  popovers in   2.2.1  but i don't think it applies in my case.. as i don't have  overflow:hidden  css anywhere.. unless i am misunderstanding the problem there... ?
