  modal fade woes  i recently updated our   plugins file to version 2.2.1 (the concatenated version offering all plugins).    swapped over all old data-* api references for the modals as we'd been using 1.4 - everything was hunky dorey. something we'd never been using was the animations, offered with the 'fade' class.     so today i wanted to pop the animations on, can anyone explain why adding the  fade  class not only breaks the modal entirely (displays the backdrop, but the modal itself is never set to display) but also makes the 'trigger' event handler not work?    i have a fiddle  here  showing the problem. it's happening cross-browser, so i know the errors on my side somewhere.  fade  removed - all good,  fade  on - broken :(    the styles seem fine? the markup is as i've always used and the minified plugin source was updated as i say very recently.    can anyone help before i spend even longer down a rabbit hole for what i hope is a silly oversight :)
