Bootstrap Modal fade woes  I recently updated our Bootstrap plugins file to version 2.2.1 (the concatenated version offering all plugins).    Swapped over all old data-* api references for the modals as we'd been using 1.4 - everything was hunky dorey. Something we'd never been using was the animations, offered with the 'fade' class.     So today I wanted to pop the animations on, can anyone explain why adding the   on - broken :(    The styles seem fine? The markup is as I've always used and the minified plugin source was updated as I say very recently.    Can anyone help before I spend even longer down a rabbit hole for what I hope is a silly oversight :)
