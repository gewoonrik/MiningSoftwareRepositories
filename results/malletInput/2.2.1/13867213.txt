  modal fade woes  i recently updated our   plugins file to version 2.2.1 (the concatenated version offering all plugins).    swapped over all old data-* api references for the modals as we'd been using 1.4 - everything was hunky dorey. something we'd never been using was the animations, offered with the 'fade' class.     so today i wanted to pop the animations on, can anyone explain why adding the   on - broken :(    the styles seem fine? the markup is as i've always used and the minified plugin source was updated as i say very recently.    can anyone help before i spend even longer down a rabbit hole for what i hope is a silly oversight :)
