How can I keep ExtJS 4.1.1 from messing up the Twitter Bootstrap 2.2.1 layout?  I really don't like ExtJS but I'm forced to use it.  I want to use Twitter Bootstrap 2.2.1 for the main layout and ExtJS for grids and JS (policy).    I have an awesome looking Bootstrap design going but the minute I load ExtJS, the navbar, fonts, etc get all hosed up.      Is there a way I can get the two to work together without going into the ExtJS and tweaking tons of CSS?    The CSS file I am using is in the following path (for ExtJS):         Thanks
