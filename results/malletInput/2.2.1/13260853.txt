how can i keep extjs 4.1.1 from messing up the     2.2.1 layout?  i really don't like extjs but i'm forced to use it.  i want to use     2.2.1 for the main layout and extjs for grids and js (policy).    i have an awesome looking   design going but the minute i load extjs, the navbar, fonts, etc get all hosed up.      is there a way i can get the two to work together without going into the extjs and tweaking tons of css?    the css file i am using is in the following path (for extjs):         thanks
