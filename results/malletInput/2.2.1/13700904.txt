Twitter Bootstrap, Typeahead, images  I'm trying to create Typeahead search with Twitter Bootstrap 2.2.1. I've managed to work with JSON and not strings like this:         Now I want to do more       Is it a right way to work with JSON in typeahead?   I want to show different types of objects in drop down - suppose I have Songs and Albums types, I want to show all Songs found then divider and then all Albums found.   I want to show images in dropdown - like covers of Albums.      I've read topic here  Allow loading images and custom HTML in typeahead results .  Quote from that topic:  "Using a combination of the item and menu options you can specify new templates" , but I still do not get how to do it in a right way.    Thank you.
