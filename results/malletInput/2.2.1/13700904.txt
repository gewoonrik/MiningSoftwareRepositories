   , typeahead, images  i'm trying to create typeahead search with     2.2.1. i've managed to work with json and not strings like this:         now i want to do more       is it a right way to work with json in typeahead?   i want to show different types of objects in drop down - suppose i have songs and albums types, i want to show all songs found then divider and then all albums found.   i want to show images in dropdown - like covers of albums.      i've read topic here  allow loading images and custom html in typeahead results .  quote from that topic:  "using a combination of the item and menu options you can specify new templates" , but i still do not get how to do it in a right way.    thank you.
