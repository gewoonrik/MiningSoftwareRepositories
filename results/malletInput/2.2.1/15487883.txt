  tabbable nav does not display expected tab in ruby on rails  i am developing based on this gemfile:         the effect is not what's expected (even if it works fine on their site, and i copy/paste it):    -when first displaying the page, active tab 1 is selected (as expected)    -when i click on 'section 2' tab, the address bar actually displays the url ...#tab2, but not the content of section 2. active tab is still 1.    -when i click on 'section 1' tab, the address bar actually displays the url ...#tab1     what did i miss ?     thanks for your help.    best regards,    fred
