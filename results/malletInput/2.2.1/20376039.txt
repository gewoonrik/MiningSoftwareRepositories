  2 on ie10 displays modal wrong  i have a problem with   2.2.1 and have a big problems with my modals in ie10.  when the modal opens it appears in the right top corner and the most of it is cutted of.  see screenshot.       this appears only in ie10.  do you know why and can you help me?    i can't show you the site and link, because it's on a site where you need a account to use it.      edit - solution: i found the solution! the modal loaded a php file and in this php file i loaded the header of the site again (the  area). and that was the mistake. after deleting the inculde line every thing worked.
