Bootstrap drop down menus not working on smart phones or tablets  I've got a problem with a Bootstrap site I've been working on. I'm not a   or javascript expert at all, I simply bought a theme and adapted it a little, expecting it to work at a basic level.    The   version in use is 2.2.1, and the problem is that drop down menus do not work properly on smart phones or tablets.    This is a sample site that demonstrates the problem:        When you click on the information menu, the drop down opens. When you click on any of the sub menu items (Our First Page, Our Second Page, etc.), it should open that page. On PCs and lap tops, this works correctly. On smart phones and tablets, the menu collapses and the new page is not opened.    This appears to be a known issue with   v 2.2.1, but none of the fixes I've found online (or here on Stackoverflow) seem to work or apply to the   files that came with the theme.    Any recommendations or help would be appreciated.    Thanks
