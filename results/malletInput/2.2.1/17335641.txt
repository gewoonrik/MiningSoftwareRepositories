    modal opening multiple backdrops, glitch in grails  using grails 2.2.1,     plugin. i'm using modals and mine are set up with 3 exit approaches. either hit the  x  button, click a  close  button, the  save  button, or, click anywhere outside the modal to close.    the problem is, 2 backdrops are being opened whenever i attempt to open a single modal due to the function i'm using. why is this? with the first 3 modal closing approaches, it closes the modal, and both backdrops. but with the final approach, it just closes the modal and a single backdrop.     here's my gsp code* sec * part is just a taglib for a security plugin i'm using):         but i still get 2 backdrops opening when i click on a single modal link.    this seems to be a grails issue, because i don't get this problem with  jsfiddle :
