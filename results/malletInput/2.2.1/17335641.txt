Twitter Bootstrap Modal opening multiple backdrops, glitch in Grails  Using Grails 2.2.1, Twitter Bootstrap plugin. I'm using modals and mine are set up with 3 exit approaches. Either hit the  x  button, click a  close  button, the  save  button, OR, click anywhere outside the modal to close.    The problem is, 2 backdrops are being opened whenever I attempt to open a single modal due to the function I'm using. Why is this? With the first 3 modal closing approaches, it closes the modal, and both backdrops. But with the final approach, it just closes the modal and a single backdrop.     Here's my gsp code* sec * part is just a taglib for a security plugin I'm using):         But I still get 2 backdrops opening when I click on a single modal link.    This seems to be a Grails issue, because I don't get this problem with  jsFiddle :
