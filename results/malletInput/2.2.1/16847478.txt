Bootstrap nav dropdown-menu only showing horizontally (Rails 3.2.13,  -sass 2.3.1.2, jquery-rails 2.2.1)  Using twitter   in a rails project, I'm aiming to get something looking like this (nice and simple, and readily achievable by putting the below code into jsfiddle to prove I'm not going crazy!). There follows a rather ascii art picture as unfortunately I can't post images yet:         which is used to distribute the menu items evenly. If I take that out, the menu will render vertically, but then the   layout goes haywire - at this point I don't really know why. Does anyone know (or even better, how to fix it)? Thank you.    I don't have Chrome to test with, but it's not just Firefox, I get the same issue in Safari.
