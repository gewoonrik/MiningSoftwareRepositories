posts of version / total posts of day

k-means:
3 clusters (major, minor, patch)
parameters:
- number of posts about version
- 

TODO:
- normalize posts to popularity of project
- # of posts per version 

Conclusions
- 2.3.2 has exceptionally high number of questions, because it was the last release of the 2.x branch. It therefore gets lots of questions.


Attempt 1:
Hypothese: major releases will have more questions
- For each version: retrieve all posts 30/7 days after the release of the version
- Normalized the posts about a release with the total number of posts about the subject of that day.
- count number of posts per version
Conclusion: hypothese is false, major releases have less questions in general

Attempt 2:
Hypothese: questions about major releases will have more score.
- For each version:
- retrieve all posts 30 days after the release of the version
- For each question: get number of stars of the answer. (only use questions with accepted answers)

Attempt 3:
Hypothese: big releases will lead to longer answer time.
- For each version:
- retrieve all posts 30 days after the release of the version
- for each post: get the answer time (time until accepted answer)
- take average 

Attempt 4:
Hypothese: major releases have different words in the question/answer than other releases (eg. deprecated, dropped, added)
- create a vector space model for each version
