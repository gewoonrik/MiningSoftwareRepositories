Steps:
- Extract questions from SO datadump (provide link to scripts)
- Build link table
- Only consider questions with the 'bootstrap'-tag
- Cleanup the questions: remove html, code, special characters
- Normalize questions: change to lowercase
- search for versions
	+ only consider versions that were released before question was asked
	+ for major versions also check for 3.0 besides 3.0.0
	+ ?: maybe use the conditional pipeline method for bettermatching 

Testing:
- Select a sample of 100 questions
- Match the questions manually
- Run the matching algorithm
- Compare manual with automatic version
- calculate precision and recall
